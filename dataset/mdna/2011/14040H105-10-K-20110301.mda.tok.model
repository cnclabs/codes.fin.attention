supervision and regulation general we are a bank holding company bhc under section of the bank holding company act of  as amended the bhc act usc and are subject to the requirements of the bhc act  including its capital adequacy standards and limitations on our nonbanking activities 
we are also subject to supervision  examination and regulation by the federal reserve board the federal reserve 
permissible activities for a bhc include those activities that are so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto  such as consumer lending and other activities that have been approved by the federal reserve by regulation or order 
certain servicing activities are also permissible for a bhc if conducted for or on behalf of the bhc or any of its affiliates 
impermissible activities for bhcs include activities that are related to commerce such as retail sales of nonfinancial products 
under federal reserve policy  we are expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to any banks that we control  including the banks  and to commit resources to support them 
on may   we became a financial holding company under the gramm leach bliley act amendments to the bhc act the glba 
the glba removed many of the restrictions on the activities of bhcs that become financial holding companies 
a financial holding company  and the non bank companies under its control  are permitted to engage in activities considered financial in nature including  for example  insurance underwriting  agency sales and brokerage  securities underwriting and dealing and merchant banking activities  incidental to financial activities or complementary to financial activities if the federal reserve determines that they pose no risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system in general 
our election to become a financial holding company under the glba certifies that the depository institutions we control meet certain criteria  including capital  management and community reinvestment act cra requirements 
effective july   under amendments to the bhc act enacted under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act  we also must be well capitalized and well managed 
if we were to fail to continue to meet the criteria for financial holding company status  we could  depending on which requirements we failed to meet  face restrictions on new financial activities or acquisitions or be required to discontinue existing activities that are not generally permissible for bank holding companies 
the banks are national associations chartered under the laws of the united states  the deposits of which are insured by the deposit insurance fund of the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic up to applicable limits 
in addition to regulatory requirements imposed as a result of cobna s international operations discussed below  the banks are subject to comprehensive regulation and periodic examination by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and the fdic 
we are also registered as a financial institution holding company under virginia law and  as such  we are subject to periodic examination by virginia s bureau of financial institutions 
we face regulation in the international jurisdictions in which we conduct business see below under regulation of international business by non us authorities 
regulation of business activities the activities of the banks as consumer lenders also are subject to regulation under various federal laws  including the truth in lending act  the equal credit opportunity act  the fair credit reporting act the fcra  the cra and the servicemembers civil relief act  as well as under various state laws 
depending on the underlying issue and applicable law  regulators are often authorized to impose penalties for violations of these statutes and  in certain cases  to order the banks to compensate injured borrowers 
borrowers may also have a private right of action for certain violations 
federal bankruptcy and state debtor relief and collection laws also affect the ability of the banks to collect outstanding balances owed by borrowers 
these laws plus state sales finance laws also affect the ability of our automobile financing business to collect outstanding balances 

table of contents new regulations of consumer lending activities the credit card act amending the truth in lending act enacted in may  and related changes to regulation z  impose a number of restrictions on credit card practices impacting rates and fees and update the disclosures required for open end credit 
for example  increases in rates charged on pre existing card balances are restricted  and rates increased since january   must now be considered for possible reductions 
overlimit fees may not be imposed without prior consent  and the number of such fees that can be charged for the same violation is constrained 
the amount of any penalty fee or charge must be reasonable and proportional to the violation 
payments above the minimum payment must be allocated first to balances with the highest interest rate 
the amount of fees charged to credit card accounts with lower credit lines is limited 
a consumer s ability to pay must be taken into account before issuing credit or increasing credit limits 
state consumer financial laws the dodd frank act created a new independent supervisory body  the consumer financial protection bureau the cfpb that will become the primary regulator for federal consumer financial statutes 
state attorneys general will be authorized to enforce new regulations issued by the cfpb 
state consumer financial laws will continue to be preempted under the national bank act under the existing standard set forth in the supreme court decision in barnett bank of marion county  na v 
nelson  which preempts any state law that significantly interferes with or impairs banking powers 
occ determinations of such preemption  however  must be on a case by case basis  and courts reviewing the occ preemption determinations will now consider the appropriateness of those determinations under a different standard of judicial review 
as a result  state consumer financial laws enacted in the future may be held to apply to our business activities 
mortgage lending the dodd frank act prescribes additional disclosure requirements and substantive limitations on our mortgage lending activities 
most of these provisions require the issuance of regulations by the cfpb or other federal agencies before they become effective 
though we do not expect the resulting regulations to have a material impact on our operations  one new requirement under the dodd frank act  the requirement for mortgage loan securitizers to retain a portion of the economic risk associated with certain mortgage loans  could impact the type and amount of mortgage loans we offer  depending on the final regulations 
debit interchange fees the dodd frank act requires that the amount of any interchange fee received by a debit card issuer with respect to debit card transactions be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction 
on december   the federal reserve released proposed rules implementing this portion of the dodd frank act  which among other things  would limit interchange fees to no greater than cents for each debit card transaction 
the proposal was open for public comment through february   with final rules to be effective on july  if finalized as proposed  the rules could negatively impact revenue from our debit card business 
dividends  stock repurchases and transfers of funds pursuant to revised temporary addendum to sr letter  dated november   we  like all large financial institutions subject to the supervisory capital assessment program scap bhcs  must consult with the federal reserve in advance of taking any action that could result in a decreased capital base  including increasing dividends  implementing a common stock repurchase program  or repurchasing capital instruments planned capital actions 
as part of that evaluation  the federal reserve  in consultation with primary federal bank regulators  will assess capital adequacy of a scap bhc and any planned capital actions based on a review of a comprehensive capital plan submitted by the scap bhc 
among other things  the capital plan must incorporate a stress testing framework that considers a range and variety of economic  financial market  and operational events to estimate potential capital needs 
traditionally  dividends to us from our direct and indirect subsidiaries have represented a major source of funds for us to pay dividends on our stock  make payments on corporate debt securities and meet our other obligations 
there are various federal and state law limitations on the extent to which the banks can finance or otherwise supply funds to us through dividends and loans 
these limitations include minimum regulatory capital requirements  federal and state banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits or surplus  sections a and b of the federal reserve act and regulation w governing transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates  as well as general federal and state regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices 
in general  federal and applicable state banking laws prohibit  without first obtaining regulatory approval  insured depository institutions  such as the banks  from making dividend distributions if such distributions are not paid out of available earnings or would cause the institution to fail to meet applicable capital adequacy standards 
however  we expect that we may receive a material amount of our funding in the form of dividends from our direct and indirect subsidiaries 

table of contents capital adequacy the banks are subject to capital adequacy guidelines adopted by federal banking regulators 
for a further discussion of the capital adequacy guidelines  see md a liquidity and capital management capital and note regulatory and capital adequacy 
the banks exceeded minimum regulatory requirements under these guidelines as of december  fdicia and prompt corrective action in general  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia subjects banks to significantly increased regulation and supervision 
among other things  fdicia requires federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
fdicia establishes five capital ratio levels well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
under applicable regulations  a bank is considered to be well capitalized if it maintains a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier leverage capital ratio of at least and is not subject to any supervisory agreement  order  or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital reserve 
a bank is considered to be adequately capitalized if it maintains a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier leverage capital ratio of at least for certain highly rated institutions  and does not otherwise meet the well capitalized definition 
the three undercapitalized categories are based upon the amount by which a bank falls below the ratios applicable to adequately capitalized institutions 
the capital categories are determined solely for purposes of applying fdicia s prompt corrective action provisions  and such capital categories may not constitute an accurate representation of the banks overall financial condition or prospects 
as of december   each of the banks met the requirements for a well capitalized institution 
as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions  fdicia requires regulators to establish certain non capital safety and soundness standards 
the standards relate generally to operations and management  asset quality  interest rate exposure and executive compensation 
the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 
heightened prudential and other requirements under the dodd frank act with the enactment of the dodd frank act  because we are a consolidated bank holding company with consolidated assets of billion or greater  we are subject to certain heightened prudential requirements  including requirements that may be recommended by the financial stability oversight council the council and implemented by the federal reserve 
as a result  we expect to be subject to more stringent standards and requirements than those applicable for smaller institutions  including risk based capital requirements  leverage limits  and liquidity requirements 
in addition  we expect to be subject to new requirements regarding risk management  resolution planning for orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure  credit exposure reporting  and concentration limits 
as part of the dodd frank enhanced supervision framework  we will be subject to annual stress tests by the federal reserve  and the company and the banks will be required to conduct semi annual stress tests  reporting results to the federal reserve and the occ 
the council also may issue recommendations to the federal reserve or other primary financial regulatory agency to apply new or heightened standards to risky financial activities or practices 
in addition to the provisions described throughout the supervision and regulation section  the dodd frank act imposes new  more stringent standards and requirements with respect to bank and nonbank acquisitions and mergers  affiliate transactions  and proprietary trading the volcker rule 
it is also possible that cona will be designated as a swap dealer under the dodd frank act  which would result in oversight by the commodity futures trading commission and more requirements for our current and future derivative transactions 
the dodd frank act prohibits conflicts of interest relating to securitizations and generally requires securitizers to retain a economic interest in the credit risk of assets sold through the issuance of asset backed securitization  with an exemption for traditionally underwritten residential mortgage loans 
the dodd frank act also includes provisions related to corporate governance and executive compensation and new fees and assessments  among others 
the federal agencies have significant discretion in drafting the implementation rules and regulations of the dodd frank act 
as a result  the impact of the dodd frank act will not be known for many months or  in some cases  years 
in addition  the dodd frank act requires various studies and reports to be delivered to congress which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action 
basel ii and iii implementation of the international accord on revised risk based capital rules known as basel ii continues to progress 
us federal banking regulators finalized the advanced version of basel ii in december and they issued a notice of proposed rulemaking for the standardized version in june neither the advanced nor standardized version is mandatory for us  but the advanced version could become so  due to growth in our reported assets or growth in our reported foreign assets 
alternatively  we might elect to comply with either the advanced or standardized versions of basel ii in the future 
compliance might require an increase in the minimum capital that we hold and also require a material investment of resources 
we will continue to monitor regulators implementation of the new rules with respect to the institutions that are subject to them and assess the potential impact to us 
in december  the basel committee on banking supervision the basel committee released proposals for additional capital and liquidity requirements  which have been clarified and amended in recent pronouncements basel iii 
in september  the basel committee announced a package of reforms that included detailed capital ratios and capital conservation buffers  subject to transition periods through in december  the basel committee published a final framework on capital and liquidity  consistent in large part with the prior proposals 
the liquidity framework included two standards for liquidity risk supervision  each subject to observation periods and transitional arrangements 
one standard promotes short term resilience by requiring sufficient high quality liquid assets to survive a stress scenario lasting for days  the other promotes longer term resilience by requiring sufficient stable funding over a one year period  based on the liquidity characteristics of assets and activities 
how us banking regulations will be modified to reflect these international standards remains unclear  particularly given the forthcoming capital and other prudential requirement regulations under the dodd frank act and the current prompt corrective action framework 
we expect  however  that minimum capital and liquidity requirements for us and other institutions will increase as a result of basel iii  the dodd frank act and related activity 
we will continue to monitor regulators implementation of the new rules with respect to the institutions that are subject to them and assess the potential impact to us 

table of contents deposits and deposit insurance each of the banks  as an insured depository institution  is a member of the deposit insurance fund the dif maintained by the fdic 
through the dif  the fdic insures the deposits of insured depository institutions up to prescribed limits for each depositor 
the dif was formed on march   upon the merger of the bank insurance fund and the savings association insurance fund in accordance with the federal deposit insurance reform act of the reform act 
the reform act permits the fdic to set a designated reserve ratio drr for the dif 
to maintain the dif  member institutions may be assessed an insurance premium  and the fdic may take action to increase insurance premiums if the drr falls below its required level 
prior to passage of the dodd frank act  the fdic had established a plan to restore the dif in the face of recent insurance losses and future loss projections  which resulted in several rules that generally increased deposit insurance rates and purported to improve risk differentiation so that riskier institutions bear a greater share of insurance premiums 
the fdic previously had issued a rule that required banks to prepay on december   their estimated quarterly risk based assessment for the fourth quarter of and for   and in connection with that rule  we have prepaid approximately million  which is included within other assets 
the dodd frank act reformed the management of the dif in several ways raised the minimum drr to from the former minimum of and removed the upper limit on the drr  required that the reserve ratio reach by september  rather than by the end of  required that in setting assessments  the fdic must offset the effect of meeting the increased reserve ratio on small insured depository institutions  and eliminated the requirement that the fdic pay dividends from the dif when the reserve ratio reaches certain levels 
in a recent final rule  the fdic set the drr at 
the fdic has proposed  in lieu of dividends  establishing progressively lower assessment rate schedules as the reserve ratio meets certain trigger levels 
the dodd frank act also required the fdic to change the deposit insurance assessment base from deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity 
the fdic recently finalized rules to implement this change and to significantly modify how deposit insurance assessment rates are calculated for those banks with assets of billion or greater 
absent any actions that management may take to minimize deposit insurance assessments  the banks assessments will increase significantly starting for the period beginning on april  on october   the fdic announced its temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp  which included the transaction account guarantee program tagp 
the tagp provided unlimited deposit insurance coverage for certain non interest bearing transaction accounts and very limited interest bearing accounts held at fdic insured depository institutions 
the tagp was originally scheduled to expire on december   but  through several extensions  continued through december  for those institutions that chose to participate 
banks may accept brokered deposits as part of their funding 
under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia  as discussed in md a liquidity and capital management  only well capitalized and adequately capitalized institutions may accept brokered deposits 
adequately capitalized institutions  however  must first obtain a waiver from the fdic before accepting brokered deposits  and such deposits may not pay rates that significantly exceed the rates paid on deposits of similar maturity from the institution s normal market area or  for deposits from outside the institution s normal market area  the national rate on deposits of comparable maturity 
the fdic is authorized to terminate a bank s deposit insurance upon a finding by the fdic that the bank s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule  regulation  order or condition enacted or imposed by the bank s regulatory agency 
the termination of deposit insurance for a bank could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and its earnings 
overdraft protection the federal reserve amended regulation e on november   to limit the ability to assess overdraft fees for paying atm and one time debit card transactions that overdraw a consumer s account  unless the consumer opts in to such payment of overdrafts 
the new rule does not apply to overdraft services with respect to checks  ach transactions  or recurring debit card transactions  or to the payment of overdrafts pursuant to a line of credit or a service that transfers funds from another account 
we are required to provide to customers written notice describing our overdraft service  fees imposed and other information  and to provide customers with a reasonable opportunity to opt in to the service 
before we may assess fees for paying discretionary overdrafts  a customer must affirmatively opt in  which could negatively impact our deposit business revenue 
the new rule was effective for all new accounts opened on or after july   and on august   it became effective for accounts opened prior to july  
table of contents source of strength and liability for commonly controlled institutions under the regulations issued by the federal reserve  a bank holding company must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks the so called source of strength doctrine 
the dodd frank act codified the source of strength doctrine  directing the federal reserve to require bank holding companies to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks 
under the cross guarantee provision of the financial institutions reform  recovery and enforcement act of firrea  insured depository institutions such as the banks may be liable to the fdic with respect to any loss incurred  or reasonably anticipated to be incurred  by the fdic in connection with the default of  or fdic assistance to  any commonly controlled insured depository institution 
the banks are commonly controlled within the meaning of the firrea cross guarantee provision 
fdic orderly liquidation authority the dodd frank act provided the fdic with liquidation authority that may be used to liquidate a financial company if the treasury secretary  in consultation with the president  based on the recommendation of the federal reserve and another federal agency  determines that doing so is necessary to mitigate serious adverse effects on us financial stability 
upon such a determination  the fdic would be appointed receiver and must liquidate the company in a way that mitigates significant risks to financial stability and minimizes moral hazard 
the costs of a liquidation of a financial company would be borne by shareholders and unsecured creditors and then  if necessary  by risk based assessments on large financial companies 
the fdic is issuing rules implementing this authority 
ffiec account management guidance on january   the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec released account management and loss allowance guidance the guidance 
the guidance applies to all credit lending of regulated financial institutions and generally requires that banks properly manage several elements of their lending programs  including line assignments  over limit practices  minimum payment and negative amortization  workout and settlement programs  and the accounting methodology used for various assets and income items related to loans 
we believe that our account management and loss allowance practices are prudent and appropriate and  therefore  consistent with the guidance 
we caution  however  the guidance provides wide discretion to bank regulatory agencies in the application of the guidance to any particular institution and its account management and loss allowance practices 
accordingly  under the guidance  bank examiners could require changes in our account management or loss allowance practices in the future  and such changes could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operation 
privacy and fair credit reporting the glba requires a financial institution to describe in a privacy notice certain of its privacy and data collection practices and requires that customers or consumers  before their nonpublic personal information is shared  be given a choice through an opt out notice to limit the sharing of such information about them with nonaffiliated third parties unless the sharing is required or permitted under the glba as implemented 
we and the banks have written privacy notices that are available through our website  the relevant legal entity or both  and are delivered to consumers and customers when required under the glba 
in accordance with the privacy notices noted above  we and the banks protect the security of information about our customers  educate our employees about the importance of protecting customer privacy and allow our customers to remove their names from the solicitation lists used and shared with others by us and the banks to the extent they use or share such lists 
we and the banks require business partners with whom we share such information to have adequate security safeguards and to abide by the redisclosure and reuse provisions of the glba 
to the extent that the glba and the fcra require us or one or more of the banks to provide customers and consumers the opportunity to opt out of sharing information  then the relevant entity or entities provide such options in the privacy notice 
in addition to adopting federal requirements regarding privacy  the glba also permits individual states to enact stricter laws relating to the use of customer information 
to date  at least california and vermont have done so by statute  regulation or referendum  and other states may consider proposals which impose additional requirements or restrictions on us or the banks 
if the federal or state regulators of the financial subsidiaries establish further guidelines for addressing customer privacy issues  we or one or more of the banks may need to amend our privacy policies and adapt our internal procedures 
under section b of the glba  among other sources of statutory authority  including state law  the banks and us are required to observe various data security related requirements  including establishing information security and data security breach response programs and properly authenticating customers before processing or enabling certain types of transactions or interactions 
the failure to observe any one or more of these requirements could subject the banks or us to enforcement action or litigation 

table of contents like other lending institutions  the banks utilize credit bureau data in their underwriting activities 
use of such data is regulated under the fcra on a uniform  nationwide basis  including credit reporting  prescreening  sharing of information between affiliates  and the use of credit data 
the fair and accurate credit transactions act of the fact act  which was enacted by congress and signed into law in december  extends the federal preemption of the fcra permanently  although the law authorizes states to enact laws regulating certain subject matters so long as they are not inconsistent with the conduct required by the fcra 
if financial institutions and credit bureaus fail to alleviate the costs and consumer frustration associated with the growing crime of identity theft  financial institutions could face increased legislative regulatory and litigation risks 
investment in the company and the banks certain acquisitions of our capital stock may be subject to regulatory approval or notice under federal or state law 
investors are responsible for ensuring that they do not  directly or indirectly  acquire shares of our capital stock in excess of the amount which can be acquired without regulatory approval 
each of the banks is an insured depository institution within the meaning of the change in bank control act 
consequently  federal law and regulations prohibit any person or company from acquiring control of us without  in most cases  prior written approval of the federal reserve or the occ  as applicable 
control is conclusively presumed if  among other things  a person or company acquires more than of any class of our voting stock 
a rebuttable presumption of control arises if a person or company acquires more than of any class of voting stock and is subject to any of a number of specified control factors as set forth in the applicable regulations 
additionally  cobna and cona are banks within the meaning of chapter of title of the code of virginia governing the acquisition of interests in virginia financial institutions the financial institution holding company act 
the financial institution holding company act prohibits any person or entity from acquiring  or making any public offer to acquire  control of a virginia financial institution or its holding company without making application to  and receiving prior approval from  the virginia bureau of financial institutions

in addition  a new consumer protection and markets authority the cpma will also be established  responsible for the conduct of all financial services firms 
a shadow structure is expected to be built during in preparation for the changes while the government consults on detailed proposals 
this consultation activity includes consideration of whether the uk consumer credit regime currently regulated by the office of fair trading the oft should become the responsibility of the new cpma 
following a review of the credit card industry by the uk government in late  the industry and uk government announced a joint commitment to a package of measures that has been incorporated into the uk s lending code 
the key measures include allocating customer payments to higher rate balances first  setting minimum payments on new customer accounts to cover at least interest  fees  charges and of the principal balance  creating the option for customers to opt out of unsolicited credit limit increases and to request reductions in their credit line  providing additional communication over re pricing of existing debt and allowing customers to opt out of the increase and pay down their balance at the existing rate  and providing annual electronic statements to customers regarding the cost to use a credit card over the year 
it is still under discussion as to when this final standard regarding annual statements will be implemented 
the uk government has also passed the financial services act which restricts the issuance of unsolicited credit card checks 
this provision of the act will now come into effect through voluntary self regulation  rather than proceeding with the commencement order for this legislation  with the changes being reflected in the next edition of the lending code  due to be published in march lenders agreed to be fully compliant with these provisions by the end of  in line with the other commitments that were agreed with the uk government

competition as a diversified financial institution that markets credit cards and consumer and commercial financial products and services  we operate in a highly competitive environment and face competition in all aspects of our business from numerous bank and non bank providers of financial services 
we compete with national and state banks for deposits  commercial loans and trust accounts and with savings and loan associations and credit unions for loans and deposits 
our competitors also include other financial services providers that provide loans  deposits  and other similar services and product 
in addition  we compete against non depository institutions that are able to offer these products and services 
we compete with international  national  regional and local issuers of visa and mastercard credit cards  as well as with american express  discover card and  to a certain extent  debit cards 
in general  customers are attracted to credit card issuers largely on the basis of price  credit limit and other product features  and customer loyalty is often limited 
in our auto finance business  we face competition from banks and non bank lenders who provide financing for dealer originated loans 
our businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and range of their products and services  transaction execution  innovation and price 
competition also varies based on the types of clients  customers  industries and geographies served 
with respect to some of our products and geographies and products  we compete globally and with respect to others  we compete on a regional basis 
our ability to compete depends on our ability to attract and retain our professional and other associates and on our reputation 
in the current environment  customers are generally attracted to depository institutions that are perceived as stable  with solid liquidity and funding 
we believe that we are able to compete effectively in our current markets 
there can be no assurance  however  that our ability to market products and services successfully or to obtain adequate returns on our products and services will not be impacted by the nature of the competition that now exists or may later develop  or by the broader economic environment 
for a discussion of the risks related to our competitive environment  please refer to item a 
risk factors 
employees a central part of our philosophy is to attract and retain a highly capable staff

technology systems we leverage information technology to achieve our business objectives and to develop and deliver products and services that satisfy our customers needs 
a key part of our strategic focus is the development of efficient  flexible computer and operational systems to support complex marketing and account management strategies  the servicing of our customers  and the development of new and diversified products 
we believe that the continued development and integration of these systems is an important part of our efforts to reduce costs  improve quality and provide faster  more flexible technology services 
consequently  we continuously review capabilities and develop or acquire systems  processes and competencies to meet our unique business requirements 

table of contents as part of our continuous efforts to review and improve our technologies  we may either develop such capabilities internally or rely on third party outsourcers who have the ability to deliver technology that is of higher quality  lower cost  or both 
over time  we have increasingly relied on third party outsourcers to help us deliver systems and operational infrastructure 
these relationships include but are not limited to total system services inc tsys for processing services for capital one s north american and united kingdom portfolios of consumer and small business credit card accounts  fidelity national information services fidelity for the capital one banking systems  and ibm corporation for management of our north american data centers 
intellectual property as part of our overall and ongoing strategy to protect and enhance our intellectual property  we rely on a variety of protections  including copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  patents and certain restrictions on disclosure  solicitation  and competition 
we also undertake other measures to control access to and distribution of our other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use certain intellectual property or proprietary information without authorization 
our precautions may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or proprietary information 
in addition  our competitors and other third parties also file patent applications for innovations that are used in our industry 
the ability of our competitors and other third parties to obtain such patents may adversely affect our ability to compete 
conversely  our ability to obtain such patents may increase our competitive advantage 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such efforts  or that the ability of our competitors to obtain such patents may not adversely impact our financial results

risk factors in this report 
item a 
risk factors business risks this section highlights specific risks that could affect our business 
although we have tried to discuss all material risks at the time this annual report on form k has been filed  please be aware that other risks may prove to be important in the future 
in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report  among the other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward looking statements are the following the current business environment  including a prolonged economic recovery  may adversely affect our industry  business  results of operations and capital levels the recent global recession has resulted in a general tightening in the credit markets  lower levels of liquidity  reduced asset values including residential and commercial properties  reduced business profits  increased rates of business and consumer delinquency  and increased rates of unemployment and consumer bankruptcy  some of which have had a negative impact on our results of operation 
although the overall economic recovery seems to be underway  it has remained modest and fragile 
a recovery that is only shallow and very gradual  marked by continued elevated unemployment rates and reduced home prices  may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as customers default on their loans or maintain lower deposit levels or  in the case of credit card accounts  carry lower balances and reduce credit card purchase activity 
in particular  we may face the following risks in connection with these events adverse macroeconomic developments may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns  causing increases in delinquencies and default rates  which could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
in addition  changes in consumer behavior  including decreased consumer spending and a shift in consumer payment strategies towards avoiding late fees  over limit fees  finance charges and other fees  could have an adverse impact on our revenues 

table of contents increases in consumer bankruptcies could cause increases in our charge off rates  which could have a negative impact on our revenues 
our ability to recover debt that we have previously charged off may be limited  which could have a negative impact on our revenues 
the processes we use to estimate inherent losses may no longer be reliable because these processes rely on complex judgments  including forecasts of economic conditions which may no longer be capable of accurate estimation  which could have a negative impact on our business 
our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the criteria or models we use to underwrite and manage our customers become less predictive of future losses  which could cause our losses to rise and have a negative impact on our results of operations 
our ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to engage in funding transactions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events  including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations  which could limit our access to funding 
increased charge offs  rising libor and other events may cause our securitization transactions to amortize earlier than scheduled  which could accelerate our need for additional funding from other sources 
we have increased our reliance on deposit funding  and an inability to accept or maintain deposits or to obtain other sources of funding could materially affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business 
many other financial institutions have also increased their reliance on deposit funding and  as such  we expect continued competition in the deposit markets 
we cannot predict how this competition will affect our costs 
if we are required to offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits  our funding costs will be adversely impacted 
regulators  rating agencies or investors could change their standards regarding appropriate capital levels for banks in general or our company in particular 
if the new standards call for capital levels higher than the capital we have or that we anticipate  it could have negative impacts on our ability to lend or to grow deposits and on our business results 
increased prepayments  refinancing or other factors could lead to a reduction in the value of our mortgage servicing rights  which could have a negative impact on our financial results 
compliance with new and existing laws and regulations may increase our costs  reduce our revenue  limit our ability to pursue business opportunities  and increase compliance challenges there has been increased legislation and regulation with respect to the financial services industry in the last few years  and we expect that oversight of our business will continue to expand in scope and complexity 
a wide and increasing array of banking  consumer lending and deposit laws apply to almost every aspect of our business 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in financial  structural and operational penalties  including receivership 
in addition  establishing systems and processes to achieve compliance with these laws and regulations may increase our costs or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities 
the credit card act amending the truth in lending act and related changes to regulation z impose a number of restrictions on credit card practices impacting rates and fees and also update the disclosures required for open end credit 
for example  increases in rates charged on pre existing card balances are restricted  and rates increased since january   must now be considered for possible reductions 
overlimit fees may not be imposed without prior consent of the customer  and the number of such fees that can be charged for the same violation is constrained 
the amount of any penalty fee or charge must be reasonable and proportional to the violation 
although we did not engage in many of the practices prohibited by the amendments  the rules could have a material adverse effect on future revenues in our us credit card business and could make the card business generally less resilient in future economic downturns 
in july  president obama signed into law the dodd frank act 
the dodd frank act  as well as the related rules and regulations adopted by various regulatory agencies  could have a significant adverse impact on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
there are a number of provisions in the dodd frank act that impact our business  including the following the dodd frank act created a new independent supervisory body  the consumer financial protection bureau the cfpb that is to be housed within the federal reserve 
the cfpb will become the primary regulator for federal consumer financial statutes 
state attorneys general will be authorized to enforce new regulations issued by the cfpb 
although state consumer financial laws will continue to be preempted under the national bank act under the existing standard set forth in the supreme court decision in barnett bank of marion county  na v 
nelson  occ determinations of such preemption must be on a case by case basis 
courts reviewing the occ preemption determinations will now consider the appropriateness of those determinations under a different standard of judicial review 
as a result  state consumer financial laws enacted in the future may be held to apply to our business activities 
the cost of complying with these additional laws could have a negative impact on our financial results 

table of contents the dodd frank act requires that the amount of any interchange fee received by a debit card issuer with respect to debit card transactions be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction 
on december   the federal reserve released proposed rules implementing this portion of the dodd frank act  which among other things  would limit interchange fees to no greater than cents for each debit card transaction 
if finalized as proposed  the rules could negatively impact revenue from our debit card business 
the issue of interchange generally will continue to be raised by legislators at the state and federal level 
while the future of these proposals is uncertain  if negative legislation is enacted  any subsequent negotiations with merchants could reduce the interchange fees that we are able to collect 
the dodd frank act contains a number of other provisions that will impact our business 
for example  the dodd frank act required the fdic to change the deposit insurance assessment base from deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity 
the fdic recently finalized rules to implement this change and to modify significantly how deposit insurance assessment rates are calculated for those banks with assets of billion or greater 
in addition  under the dodd frank act  many trust preferred securities will cease to qualify for tier capital  subject to a three year phase out period expected to begin in and the dodd frank act will most likely subject us to the supervision of regulatory agencies that historically have not regulated our businesses  such as the commodity futures trading commission with respect to our derivatives activities 
these provisions could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition by increasing our cost of funding  our cost of capital or our cost of complying with applicable laws and regulations 
certain laws and regulations  and any interpretations and applications with respect thereto  may benefit consumers  borrowers and depositors  but not stockholders 
the legislative and regulatory environment is beyond our control  may change rapidly and unpredictably and may negatively influence our revenue  costs  earnings  growth and capital levels 
our success depends on our ability to maintain compliance with both existing and new laws and regulations 
for a description of the laws and regulations to which we are subject  please refer to supervision and regulation in item business 
we may experience increased delinquencies and credit losses like other lenders  we face the risk that our customers will not repay their loans 
rising losses or leading indicators of rising losses such as higher delinquencies  higher rates of non performing loans  higher bankruptcy rates  lower collateral values or elevated unemployment rates may require us to increase our allowance for loan and lease losses  which may degrade our profitability if we are unable to raise revenue or reduce costs to compensate for higher losses 
in particular  we face the following risks in this area missed payments 
our customers may miss payments 
loan charge offs including from bankruptcies are generally preceded by missed payments or other indications of worsening financial condition 
our reported delinquency levels measure these trends 
customers are more likely to miss payments during an economic downturn or prolonged periods of slow economic growth 
in addition  we face the risk that consumer and commercial customer behavior may change for example  an increase in the unwillingness or inability of customers to repay debt  causing a long term rise in delinquencies and charge offs 
estimates of inherent losses 
the credit quality of our portfolio can have a significant impact on our earnings 
we allow for and reserve against credit risks based on our assessment of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolios 
this process  which is critical to our financial results and condition  requires complex judgments  including forecasts of economic conditions 
we may underestimate our inherent losses and fail to hold a loan loss allowance sufficient to account for these losses 
incorrect assumptions could lead to material underestimates of inherent losses and inadequate allowance for loan and lease losses 
in addition  our estimate of inherent losses impacts the amount of allowances we build to account for those losses 
the increase or release of allowances impacts our current financial results 
underwriting 
our ability to assess the credit worthiness of our customers may diminish 
if the models and approaches we use to select  manage  and underwrite our consumer and commercial customers become less predictive of future charge offs due  for example  to rapid changes in the economy  including the unemployment rate  our credit losses may increase and our returns may deteriorate 

table of contents business mix 
our business mix could change in ways that could adversely affect credit losses 
we participate in a mix of businesses with a broad range of credit loss characteristics 
consequently  changes in our business mix may change our charge off rate 
charge off recognition 
the rules governing charge off recognition could change 
we record charge offs according to accounting and regulatory guidelines and rules 
these guidelines and rules  including the ffiec account management guidance  could require changes in our account management or loss allowance practices and cause our charge offs to increase for reasons unrelated to the underlying performance of our portfolio 
such changes could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operation 
industry practices 
our charge off and delinquency rates may be negatively impacted by industry developments  including new regulations applicable to our industry 
collateral 
collateral  when we have it  could be insufficient to compensate us for loan losses 
when customers default on their loans and we have collateral  we attempt to seize it where permissible and appropriate 
however  the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to compensate us for the amount of the unpaid loan  and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from our customers 
particularly with respect to our commercial lending and home loan activities  decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for our loans and investments 
thus  the recovery of such property could be insufficient to compensate us for the value of these loans 
new york concentration 
although our lending is geographically diversified  approximately of our commercial loan portfolio is concentrated in the new york metropolitan area 
the regional economic conditions in the new york area affect the demand for our commercial products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay their commercial loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans 
a prolonged decline in the general economic conditions in the new york region could have a material adverse effect on the performance of our commercial loan portfolio and our results of operations 
we may experience increased losses associated with mortgage repurchases and indemnification obligations certain of our subsidiaries  including greenpoint mortgage funding  inc greenpoint  capital one home loans and cona  as successor to chevy chase bank  may be required to repurchase mortgage loans that have been sold to investors in the event there are certain breaches of certain representations and warranties contained within the sales agreements 
we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans that we sell to investors in the event that there was improper underwriting or fraud or in the event that the loans become delinquent shortly after they are originated 
these subsidiaries also may be required to indemnify certain purchasers and others against losses they incur in the event of breaches of representations and warranties and in various other circumstances  and the amount of such losses could exceed the repurchase amount of the related loans 
consequently  we may be exposed to credit risk associated with sold loans 
we have established a reserve in our consolidated financial statements for potential losses that are considered to be both probable and reasonably estimable related to the mortgage loans sold by our originating subsidiaries 
the adequacy of the reserve and the ultimate amount of losses incurred will depend on  among other things  the actual future mortgage loan performance  the actual level of future repurchase and indemnification requests  the actual success rate of claimants  developments in litigation related to us and the industry  actual recoveries on the collateral and macroeconomic conditions including unemployment levels and housing prices 
due to uncertainties relating to these factors  there can be no assurance that our reserves will be adequate or that the total amount of losses incurred will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition or results of operations 
for additional information related to our mortgage loan repurchase and indemnification obligations and related reserves  see md a consolidated balance sheet analysis and credit performance potential mortgage representation and warranty liabilities 
we may not be able to maintain adequate capital levels or liquidity  which could have a negative impact on our financial results as a result of the dodd frank act and international accords  financial institutions will become subject to new and increased capital and liquidity requirements 
while it is not yet clear what form these requirements will take or how they will apply to us  it is possible that we could be required to increase our capital levels above the levels in our current financial plans 
these new requirements could have a negative impact on our ability to lend  grow deposit balances or make acquisitions and on our ability to make capital distributions in the form of increased dividends or share repurchases 
higher capital levels could also lower our return on equity 
recent developments in capital and liquidity requirements that may impact us include the following in december  the basel committee on banking supervision published a final framework commonly known as basel iii on capital and liquidity 
the key elements of the capital proposal include raising the quality  consistency and transparency of the capital base  strengthening the risk coverage of the capital framework  introducing a leverage ratio that is different from the us leverage ratio measures and promoting the build up of capital buffers 
the liquidity framework includes two standards for liquidity risk supervision  one standard promoting short term resilience and the other promoting longer term resilience 
how us banking regulations will be modified to reflect these international standards remains unclear  particularly given the forthcoming capital and other prudential requirement regulations under the dodd frank act and the current prompt corrective action framework 
we expect  however  that minimum capital and liquidity requirements for the company and other institutions will increase as a result of basel iii  the dodd frank act and related activity 

table of contents because we are a consolidated bank holding company with consolidated assets of billion or greater  we are subject to certain heightened prudential requirements  including requirements that may be recommended by the financial stability oversight council and implemented by the federal reserve 
as a result  we expect to be subject to more stringent standards and requirements than those applicable for smaller institutions  including risk based capital requirements  leverage limits and liquidity requirements 
see item business supervision and regulation capital adequacy for additional information 
we face risk related to the strength of our operational  technological and organizational infrastructure our ability to grow and compete is dependent on our ability to build or acquire the necessary operational  technological and organizational infrastructure 
we have substantially completed significant development projects to complete the systems integration of chevy chase bank and to build a scalable banking infrastructure 
implementation of such infrastructure changes and upgrades may  at least temporarily  cause disruptions to our business  including  but not limited to  systems interruptions  transaction processing errors and system conversion delays  all of which could have a negative impact on us 
similar to other large corporations  we are exposed to operational risk that can manifest itself in many ways  such as errors related to failed or inadequate processes  faulty or disabled computer systems  fraud by employees or persons outside of our company and exposure to external events 
in addition  we are heavily dependent on the strength and capability of our technology systems which we use to manage our internal financial and other systems  interface with our customers and develop and implement effective marketing campaigns 
our ability to develop and deliver new products that meet the needs of our existing customers and attract new ones and to run our business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations depends on the functionality of our operational and technology systems 
any disruptions or failures of our operational and technology systems  including those associated with improvements or modifications to such systems  could cause us to be unable to market and manage our products and services or to report our financial results in a timely and accurate manner  all of which could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
in some cases  we outsource the maintenance and development of our operational and technological functionality to third parties 
these third parties may experience errors or disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control 
any increase in the amount of our infrastructure that we outsource to third parties may increase our exposure to these risks 
we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of our mergers and acquisitions we have engaged in merger and acquisition activity over the past several years and may continue to engage in such activity in the future 
if we are not able to achieve the anticipated benefits of such mergers and acquisitions  including cost savings and other synergies  our business could be negatively affected 
in addition  it is possible that the ongoing integration processes could result in the loss of key employees  errors or delays in systems implementation  the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients  customers  depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger or acquisition 
integration efforts also may divert management attention and resources 
these integration matters may have an adverse effect on us during any transition period 
our acquisitions also may involve our entry into new businesses and new geographic or other markets which present risks resulting from our relative inexperience in these new areas or these new businesses 
these new businesses change the overall character of our consolidated portfolio of businesses and could react differently to economic and other external factors 
we face the risk that we will not be successful in these new businesses or in these new markets 
we face the risk of fluctuations in our expenses and other costs that may hurt our financial results our expenses and other costs  such as operating  labor and marketing expenses  directly affect our earnings results 
in light of the extremely competitive environment in which we operate  and because the size and scale of many of our competitors provide them with increased operational efficiencies  it is important that we are able to successfully manage our expenses 
many factors can influence the amount of our expenses  as well as how quickly they may increase 
our on going investments in infrastructure  which may be necessary to maintain a competitive business  integrate newly acquired businesses and establish scalable operations  may increase our expenses 
in addition  as our business develops  changes or expands  additional expenses can arise as a result of a reevaluation of business strategies  management of outsourced services  asset purchases or other acquisitions  structural reorganization  compliance with new laws or regulations or the integration of newly acquired businesses 
if we are unable to successfully manage our expenses  our financial results will be negatively affected 
reputational risk and social factors may impact our results our ability to originate and maintain accounts is highly dependent upon the perceptions of consumer and commercial borrowers and deposit holders and other external perceptions of our business practices or our financial health 
adverse perceptions regarding our reputation in the consumer  commercial and funding markets could lead to difficulties in generating and maintaining accounts as well as in financing them 
particularly  negative perceptions regarding our reputation could lead to decreases in the levels of deposits that consumer and commercial customers and potential customers choose to maintain with us 
in addition  a variety of social factors may cause changes in borrowing activity  including credit card use  payment patterns and the rate of defaults by accountholders and borrowers domestically and internationally 
these social factors include changes in consumer confidence levels  the public s perception regarding consumer debt  including credit card use  and changing attitudes about the stigma of personal bankruptcy 
if consumers develop negative attitudes about incurring debt or if consumption trends continue to decline  our business and financial results will be negatively affected 
we face intense competition in all of our markets we operate in a highly competitive environment  and we expect competitive conditions to continue to intensify 
in such a competitive environment  we may lose entire accounts or may lose account balances to competing financial institutions  or we may find it more costly to maintain our existing customer base 
customer attrition from any or all of our lending products  together with any lowering of interest rates or fees that we might implement to retain customers  could reduce our revenues and therefore our earnings 
similarly  customer attrition from our deposit products  in addition to an increase in rates or services that we may offer to retain those deposits  may increase our expenses and therefore reduce our earnings 
we expect that competition will continue to increase with respect to most of our products 
some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are  which may give those competitors advantages  including a more diversified product and customer base  the ability to reach out to more customers and potential customers  operational efficiencies  more versatile technology platforms  broad based local distribution capabilities  lower cost funding and larger existing branch networks 
in addition  some of our competitors are not subject to the same regulatory requirements or legislative scrutiny to which we are subject  which also could place us at a competitive disadvantage 

table of contents fluctuations in market interest rates or the capital markets could adversely affect our revenue and expense  the value of assets and obligations  our cost of capital or our liquidity like other financial institutions  our business may be sensitive to market interest rate movement and the performance of the financial markets 
changes in interest rates or in valuations in the debt or equity markets could directly impact us 
for example  we borrow money from other institutions and depositors  which we use to make loans to customers and invest in debt securities and other earning assets 
we earn interest on these loans and assets and pay interest on the money we borrow from institutions and depositors 
fluctuations in interest rates  including changes in the relationship between short term rates and long term rates and in the relationship between our funding basis rate and our lending basis rate  may have negative impacts on our net interest income and therefore our earnings 
in addition  interest rate fluctuations and competitor responses to those changes may effect the rate of customer pre payments for mortgage  auto and other term loans and may affect the balances customers carry on their credit cards 
these changes can reduce the overall yield on our earning asset portfolio 
changes in interest rates and competitor responses to these changes may also impact customer decisions to maintain balances in the deposit accounts they have with us 
in addition  changes in valuations in the debt and equity markets could have a negative impact on the assets we hold in our investment portfolio 
finally  such market changes could also have a negative impact on the valuation of assets for which we provide servicing 
we assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on our earnings under various scenarios that differ based on assumptions about the direction and the magnitude of interest rate changes 
we take risk mitigation actions based on those assessments 
we face the risk that changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income and our earnings in material amounts  especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different than those we assumed 
see md a market risk management for additional information 
our business could be negatively affected if it is unable to attract  retain and motivate skilled senior leaders our success depends  in large part  on our ability to retain key senior leaders  and competition for such senior leaders can be intense in most areas of our business 
the executive compensation provisions of the dodd frank act and the regulations issued thereunder  and any further legislation or regulation restricting executive compensation  may limit the types of compensation arrangements that we may enter into with our most senior leaders and could have a negative impact on our ability to attract  retain and motivate such leaders in support of our long term strategy 
these laws and regulations may not apply in the same manner to all financial institutions  and we therefore may face more restrictions than other institutions and companies with whom we compete for talent 
if we are unable to retain talented senior leadership  our business could be negatively affected 
our businesses are subject to the risk of increased litigation our businesses are subject to increased litigation as a result of the highly regulated nature of the financial services industry and the structure of the credit card industry  and we face risks from the outcomes of such industry litigation 
substantial legal liability against us could have a material adverse effect or cause significant reputational harm to us  which could seriously harm our business 
for a description of the litigation risks that we face  see note commitments  contingencies and guarantees 
we face risks from unpredictable catastrophic events despite our substantial business contingency plans  the impact from natural disasters and other catastrophic events  including terrorist attacks  may have a negative effect on our business and infrastructure  including our information technology systems 
the impact of such events and other catastrophes on the overall economy may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we face risks from the use of estimates in our financial statements pursuant to united states generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements  including  but not limited to  estimating our allowance for loan and lease losses and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities 
if the assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect  we may experience unexpected material losses

table of contents item selected financial data we prepare our consolidated financial statements using generally accepted accounting principles in the us us gaap  which we refer to as our reported results 
below we present selected consolidated financial data from our reported results of operations for the five year period ended december   as well as selected consolidated balance sheet data as of the end of each year within this five year period 
prior to january   we also presented and analyzed our results on a non gaap managed basis 
our managed presentation assumed that securitized loans accounted for as sales and reported as off balance sheet in accordance with applicable accounting guidance in effect prior to january   remained on balance sheet  and the earnings from the loans underlying these trusts are reported in our results of operations in the same manner as the earnings from loans that we own

impact from adoption of new consolidation accounting standards impact on reported financial information effective january   we prospectively adopted two new accounting standards that had a significant impact on our accounting for entities previously considered to be off balance sheet arrangements 
the adoption of these new accounting standards resulted in the consolidation of our credit card securitization trusts  one of our installment loan trusts and certain option adjustable rate mortgages option arm loan trusts originated by chevy chase bank 
prior to january   transfers of our credit card receivables  installment loans and certain option adjustable rate mortgage loans to our securitization trusts were accounted for as sales and treated as off balance sheet 
at the adoption of these new accounting standards on january   we added to our reported consolidated balance sheet billion of assets  consisting primarily of credit card loan receivables underlying the consolidated securitization trusts  along with billion of related debt issued by these trusts to third party investors 
we also recorded an after tax charge to retained earnings on january  of billion  reflecting the net cumulative effect of adopting these new accounting standards 
this charge primarily related to the addition of billion to our allowance for loan and lease losses for the newly consolidated loans and the recording of billion in related deferred tax assets 
the initial recording of these amounts on our reported balance sheet as of january  had no impact on our reported income 
we provide additional information on the impact on our financial statements from the adoption of these new accounting standards in note summary of significant accounting policies and note variable interest entities and securitizations 
we discuss the impact on our capital ratios below in liquidity and capital management capital 
although the adoption of these new accounting standards does not change the economic risk to our business  specifically our exposure to liquidity  credit and interest rate risks  the prospective adoption of these rules has a significant impact on our capital ratios and the presentation of our reported consolidated financial statements  including changes in the classification of specific consolidated statements of income line items 
the most significant changes to our reported consolidated financial statements are outlined below financial statement accounting and presentation changes balance sheet significant increase in restricted cash  securitized loans and securitized debt resulting from the consolidation of securitization trusts 
significant increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses resulting from the establishment of a loan loss reserve for the loans underlying the consolidated securitization trusts 
significant reduction in accounts receivable from securitizations resulting from the reversal of retained interests held in securitization trusts that have been consolidated 
statement of income significant increase in interest income and interest expense attributable to the securitized loans and debt underlying the consolidated securitization trusts 
changes in the amount recorded for the provision for loan and lease losses  resulting from the establishment of an allowance for loan and lease losses for the loans underlying the consolidated securitization trusts 
amounts previously recorded as servicing and securitization income are now classified in our results of operations in the same manner as the earnings on loans not held in securitization trusts 
statement of cash flows significant change in the amounts of cash flows from investing and financing activities 

table of contents beginning with the first quarter of  our reported consolidated statements of income no longer reflect securitization and servicing income related to newly consolidated loans 
instead  we report interest income  net charge offs and certain other income associated with securitized loan receivables and interest expense associated with the debt securities issued from the trust to third party investors in the same consolidated statements of income categories as loan receivables and corporate debt 
additionally  we no longer record initial gains on new securitization activity since the majority of our securitized loans will no longer receive sale accounting treatment 
because our securitization transactions are being accounted for under the new consolidation accounting rules as secured borrowings rather than asset sales  the cash flows from these transactions are presented as cash flows from financing activities rather than as cash flows from operating or investing activities 
notwithstanding this change in accounting  our securitization transactions are structured to legally isolate the receivables from our company  and we do not expect to be able to access the assets of our securitization trusts 
we do  however  continue to have the rights associated with our retained interests in the assets of these trusts 
because we prospectively adopted the new consolidation accounting standards  our historical reported results and consolidated financial statements for periods prior to january  reflect our securitization trusts as off balance sheet in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance in effect during this period 
accordingly  our reported results and consolidated financial statements subsequent to january  are not presented on a basis consistent with our reported results and consolidated financial statements for periods prior to january  this inconsistency limits the comparability of our post january  reported results to our prior period reported results 
impact on non gaap managed financial information in addition to analyzing our results on a reported basis  management historically evaluated our total company and business segment results on a non gaap managed basis 
our managed presentations reflected the results from both our on balance sheet loans and off balance sheet loans and excluded the impact of card securitization activity 
our managed presentations assumed that our securitized loans had not been sold and that the earnings from securitized loans were classified in our results of operations in the same manner as the earnings on loans that we owned 
our managed results also reflected differences in accounting for the valuation of retained interests and the recognition of gains and losses on the sale of interest only strips 
our managed results did not include the addition of an allowance for loan and lease losses for the loans underlying our off balance sheet securitization trusts 
while our managed presentation resulted in differences in the classification of revenues in our income statement  net income on a managed basis was the same as reported net income 
prior to january   we used our non gaap managed basis presentation to evaluate the credit performance and overall financial performance of our entire managed loan portfolio because the same underwriting standards and ongoing risk monitoring are used for both securitized loans and loans that we own 
in addition  we used the managed presentation as the basis for making decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources  such as employees and capital 
because management used our managed basis presentation to evaluate our performance  we also provided this information to investors 
we believed that our managed basis information was useful to investors because it portrayed the results of both on and off balance sheet loans that we managed  which enabled investors to understand the credit risks associated with the portfolio of loans reported on our consolidated balance sheet and our retained interests in securitized loans 
in periods prior to january   certain of our non gaap managed measures differed from the comparable reported measures 
the adoption on january  of the new consolidation accounting standards resulted in accounting for the loans in our securitization trusts in our reported financial statements in a manner similar to how we account for these loans on a managed basis 
as a result  our reported and managed basis presentations are generally comparable for periods beginning after january  we believe that investors will be able to better understand our financial results and evaluate trends in our business if our period over period data are reflected on a more comparable basis 
accordingly  unless otherwise noted  this md a compares our reported us gaap financial information as of and for the year ended december  with our non gaap managed based financial information as of and for the years ended december  and we provide a reconciliation of our non gaap managed based information for periods prior to january  to the most comparable reported us gaap information in exhibit executive summary and business outlook we continued to operate in an environment of elevated economic and regulatory uncertainty during the overall economic recovery remained modest and fragile 
the unemployment rate remained persistently high at close to and the housing market continued to struggle  due in part to the large backlog of homes in the foreclosure process and high rate of delinquent loans 
the ongoing and expected development of new regulations and regulatory organizations resulting from the recently enacted dodd frank act contributed to continued regulatory uncertainty 

table of contents despite the challenges presented by these conditions  we began to see some stabilization in loan volumes  as well as improvements in our credit results that outpaced the economic recovery during each of our businesses performed well during the year  generating net income of billion per diluted share in  which represented a substantial increase of billion over our reported net income of million per diluted share in we provide highlights of our financial performance below 
financial highlights as noted above  the presentation of our results on a non gaap managed basis prior to january  assumed that our securitized loans had not been sold and that the earnings from securitized loans were classified in our results of operations in the same manner as the earnings on loans that we owned 
these classification differences resulted in differences in certain revenue and expense components of our results of operations on a reported basis and our results of operations on a managed basis  although net income for both basis was the same 
we provide a summary of our managed results for and in note business segments 
the billion increase in our reported net income in was largely attributable to a substantial reduction in the provision for loan and lease losses  which was partially offset by an increase in losses from discontinued operations and a decrease in total revenue 
decrease in provision for loan and lease losses the provision for loan and lease losses decreased by billion  or  to billion in the decrease in the provision was driven by the continued improvement of our credit quality indicators as a result of the slowly improving economy and actions taken by us over the past several years to improve underwriting standards and exit portfolios with unattractive credit metrics 
as a result  we recorded a net release of billion in in our allowance  after taking into consideration the addition to our allowance on january  from the adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards compared with a net allowance release of million in increase in loss from discontinued operations the loss from discontinued operations increased by million to million in  primarily due to a significant increase in the provision for mortgage loan repurchase losses related to the discontinued operations of the wholesale mortgage banking unit of greenpoint  which we closed in we recorded an after tax provision for mortgage loan repurchase losses related to discontinued operations of million million pre tax in  compared with an after tax provision related to discontinued operations of million million pre tax in decrease in total revenue total revenue decreased by million  or  in  largely due to a decline in non interest fee income attributable to a reduction in customer accounts  and loan balances and the implementation of provisions of the card act  which resulted in a reduction in penalty fees 
below are additional highlights of our performance for these highlights generally are based on a comparison of our reported results for to our managed results for the highlights of changes in our financial condition and credit performance are generally based on our reported financial condition and credit statistics as of december   compared with our financial condition and credit performance on a managed basis as of december  we provide a more detailed discussion of our results of operation  financial condition and credit performance in consolidated results of operations financial performance  consolidated balance sheet analysis and credit performance and business segment financial performance 
credit card our credit card business generated income of billion in  compared with income of million in the primary drivers of the improvement in our credit card business results were an increase in the net interest margin and a significant decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses 
the increase in the net interest margin was attributable to the combined impact of higher asset yields and lower funding costs 
the increase in the average yield on our credit card loan portfolio reflected the benefit of pricing changes that we implemented during and the continued benefit from rising collectability estimates due to favorable credit trends  while the decrease in our funding costs was attributable to the lower interest rate environment and shift in our funding mix to lower cost deposits from higher cost wholesale sources 
the decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses was due to more favorable credit quality trends as well as a decline in outstanding loan balances 

table of contents consumer banking our consumer banking business generated income of million in  compared with income of million in the significant improvement in profitability in our consumer banking business was attributable to improved credit conditions and consumer credit performance  particularly within our auto loan portfolio  including reduced charge offs 
our consumer banking business also benefited from deposit growth resulting from our continued strategy to leverage our bank outlets to attract lower cost funding sources and from improved deposit spreads  as we continue to shift the mix of our deposits to lower cost consumer savings and money market deposits from higher cost time deposits 
commercial banking our commercial banking business generated income of million in  compared with a loss of million in the improvement in results for our commercial banking business in from was attributable to the stabilization in credit performance trends since the end of  resulting in a significant reduction in the provision for loan and lease losses 
strong deposit growth resulting from our continued strategy to grow deposits as a lower cost funding source  as well as improved deposit spreads resulting from repricing of higher rate deposits to lower rates in response to the overall lower interest rate environment also provided a benefit to our commercial banking business 
while our commercial banking credit metrics remain elevated  the commercial real estate market has exhibited signs of continuing improvement  including increasing leasing activity  declining vacancies and re entry of traditional commercial real estate investors and sponsors into the market  particularly in new york where we have our most significant concentration 
total loans total loans held for investment decreased by billion  or  in to billion as of december   from billion as of december  this decrease was primarily due to the expected run off of installment loans in our credit card business and home loans in our consumer banking business  elevated charge offs and weak consumer demand 
charge off and delinquency statistics although net charge off and delinquency rates remain elevated  these rates improved significantly in the net charge off rate decreased to in  from in  and the day performing delinquency rate decreased to in  from in based on strong credit performance trends  such as the significant decline in the day performing delinquency rate from at the end of  we believe our net charge offs resulting from the severe economic downturn peaked in the first quarter of allowance for loan and lease losses as a result of the adoption of the new consolidation accounting guidance  we increased our allowance for loan and lease losses by billion to billion on january  the initial recording of this amount on our reported balance sheet as of january  reduced our stockholders equity but had no impact on our reported results of operations 
after taking into consideration the billion addition to our allowance for loan and lease losses on january   our allowance for loan and lease losses decreased by billion to billion as of december  the decrease was attributable to an overall improvement in credit quality trends  as well as the decrease in loan balances 
the allowance as a percentage of our total reported loans held for investment was as of december   compared with as of december  representation and warranty reserve we have established reserves for our mortgage loan repurchase exposure related to the sale of mortgage loans by our subsidiaries to various parties under contractual provisions that include various representations and warranties 
these reserves reflect inherent losses as of each balance sheet date that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable 
we recorded a provision for this exposure of million in  of which million was included in non interest income and million was included in discontinued operations 
in comparison  we recorded a provision of million in  of which million was included in non interest income and million was included in discontinued operations 
because of the significant increase in claim requests from government sponsored entities gses and active insured securitizations and litigation activity during  we refined our loss estimation process and made certain changes in assumptions 
during second quarter of  we extended the timeframe over which we estimated our repurchase liability for mortgage loans sold by our subsidiaries to gses and those mortgage loans placed into active insured securitizations for the full life of the mortgage loans  which resulted in a significant increase in the provision for mortgage loan repurchase losses 
of the million of provision recorded in  approximately million resulted from our ability to extend the timeframe over which we estimated our repurchase liability 
the remaining million related primarily to changing counterparty activity in the form of updated estimates around active and probable litigation  most of which occurred in the first quarter of our representation and warranty reserves totaled million as of december   compared with million as of december  capital adequacy while the consolidation of the loans underlying our securitization trusts on january  reduced our capital ratios  our financial strength and capacity to absorb risk remained high 
our tier risk based capital ratio of as of december  was comfortably above the current minimum regulatory requirement of 
our non gaap tier common equity ratio was as of december   while our non gaap tangible common equity to tangible managed assets tce ratio was 
see exhibit for a calculation of our regulatory capital ratios and a reconciliation of our non gaap capital measures 

table of contents business environment and significant recent developments the lingering economic and regulatory impacts of will likely impact the full year income statement in we expect that revenue will reflect the full year effects of revenue impacts that began in  including changes to revenue in our credit card business as a result of the card act implementation and the reductions in fee revenues brought on by new regulations 
we expect the slow paced economic recovery will continue  with the overall unemployment rate expected to remain elevated for an extended period of time 
we also continue to see risks in the housing market  due in part to the large backlog of homes in the foreclosure process and high rate of delinquent loans  which could be exacerbated if recent disruptions in industry foreclosure practices continue 
we anticipate over the course of coming quarters to see evidence of the path to solid and sustained performance 
we believe that substantially all of the impacts on revenue related to card act regulations were reflected in our fourth quarter revenue margins 
we expect relatively less impact from other aspects of the recently enacted financial legislation 
we provide more information on recent regulatory developments in supervision and regulation in item business of this report 
business outlook we discuss below our current expectations regarding our total company performance and the performance of each of our business segments over the near term based on market conditions  the regulatory environment and our business strategies as of the time we filed this annual report on form k 
the statements contained in this section are based on our current expectations regarding our outlook for our financial results and business strategies 
our expectations take into account  and should be read in conjunction with  our expectations regarding economic trends and analysis of our business as discussed in item business and md a of this report 
certain statements are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of actual results could differ materially from those in our forward looking statements 
forward looking statements do not reflect i any change in current dividend or repurchase strategies  ii the effect of any acquisitions  divestitures or similar transactions or iii any changes in laws  regulations or regulatory interpretations  in each case after the date as of which such statements are made 
see forward looking statements in item business of this report for factors that could materially influence our results 
total company expectations we believe we are emerging from the recession in a strong position to deliver attractive and sustainable results over the long term  including moderate growth and attractive risk adjusted returns on assets in our credit card and auto finance businesses  moderate growth in low risk loans in our commercial banking business and strong growth in low cost deposits and high quality commercial and retail customer relationships 
based on recent trends and our targeted initiatives to attract new business and develop customer relationships  we believe there is reasonable potential for loan growth during  which will depend on consumer demand 
total loans loan balances stabilized in the second half of  reflecting the decline in charge offs  gradual abatement of expected portfolio run offs and seasonal consumer spending trends 
the lower starting point for loan balances from will cause the average loan balances in to be comparable to  even as we expect period end balances to grow 
the timing and pace of expected growth will depend on broader economic trends that impact overall consumer and commercial demand 
expenses we anticipate that non interest expenses will increase in  assuming that the increase in marketing opportunities we observed in late continues through provision for loan and lease losses based on the underlying credit trends we are experiencing  we expect that charge offs will continue their downward trend  although the pace of the allowance releases of is likely to abate during we expect that the improvement in credit trends in our consumer lending businesses will continue to outpace the economic recovery 
we believe that the worst of the commercial banking business credit downturn is behind us  however  we expect a few more quarters of fluctuations in the charge off and nonperforming loan metrics in our commercial banking business 
margins margins will be affected as the onboarding of lower yield and lower loss assets are offset by a lower year over year average cost of funds and higher transaction volume 
we expect margins to remain at strong levels  although they may drift downward modestly  depending upon the competitive environment and the timing and pace of loan growth 
we expect continued funding mix shift towards deposits in  which should provide modest funding cost benefits to net interest margin 
capital we expect regulatory capital ratios to rise steadily after a temporary decline in the first quarter of although capital measures such as our non gaap tce are expected to rise steadily  we expect our tier risk based capital ratio and our non gaap tier common equity ratio to decline into the first quarter of  primarily due to two factors that affect the numerator and denominator used in calculating these ratios i a decrease in the numerator resulting from the disallowance of a portion of the deferred tax assets and ii an increase in the denominator due to the remaining phase in during the first quarter of of risk weighted assets resulting from the new consolidation accounting standards 
even with the expected increase in our loan balances  the completion of this consolidation will most likely lead to slower growth in the denominator of our regulatory capital ratios over the next couple of years as compared to the recent past 
we expect the numerator of these ratios will rise not only as we generate earnings but also with the steady decline in our disallowed deferred tax asset amount  which we expect will be around billion at the end of the first quarter of and will largely disappear over the next couple of years 

table of contents based on the current definitions proposed by the basel committee  we expect to exceed in the basel iii minimum common equity ratio  including the capital conservation buffer 
we expect that our strong capital position and generation will enable us to deploy capital in the service of shareholders to generate attractive returns in and beyond 
business segment expectations credit card business we expect that normal seasonal patterns will drive a decline in domestic card loan balances in the first quarter of  and that the first quarter of will be the low point for domestic card loan balances 
after the first quarter of  we expect loan balances in our credit card business to grow 
by the end of the second quarter of  we expect domestic card loan balances to be higher than balances at the end of we expect further growth in the second half of we anticipate modest improvements from current charge off levels in we expect to add partnership loan portfolios and growth platforms  including launching the recently announced partnership with kohl department stores  inc  which we expect to settle in the second quarter of consumer banking business in our consumer banking business  we expect that auto finance origination volumes and returns will remain strong in we expect our retail banking business will continue to deliver strong growth in low cost deposits and valuable customer relationships 
commercial banking business in our commercial banking business  nonperforming asset rates and criticized loans continue to improve modestly  and  as such  we believe that the worst of the commercial banking business credit deterioration cycle is behind us 
we believe  however  that the charge off rate for our commercial banking business will continue to fluctuate over the next several quarters 
we expect to grow our commercial banking loan portfolio in based on strong deposit growth and new commercial customer relationships in  we expect to generate future loan and revenue growth by expanding the relationships with our customers in and beyond 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make a number of judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  income and expenses in the consolidated financial statements 
understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements 
we provide a summary of our significant accounting policies in note summary of significant accounting policies 
we have identified the following accounting policies as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our reported results of operations or financial condition 
these critical accounting policies govern fair value allowance for loan and lease losses asset impairment 
table of contents representation and warranty reserve revenue recognition derivative and hedge accounting income taxes we evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary based on changing conditions 
management has reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies and has discussed these policies with the audit and risk committee of the board of directors 
fair value fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date also referred to as an exit price 
the fair value accounting guidance provides a three level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments 
this hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable 
fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned to a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below level quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable market based inputs  other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs 
the degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted prices in active markets or observable market parameters 
when quoted prices and observable data in active markets are not fully available  management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value 
changes in market conditions  such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities  may reduce the availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine fair value 
we have developed policies and procedures to determine when markets for our financial assets and liabilities are inactive if the level and volume of activity has declined significantly relative to normal conditions 
if markets are determined to be inactive  it may be appropriate to adjust price quotes received 
when significant adjustments are required to price quotes or inputs  it may be appropriate to utilize an estimate based primarily on unobservable inputs 
significant judgment may be required to determine whether certain financial instruments measured at fair value are included in level or level in making this determination  we consider all available information that market participants use to measure the fair value of the financial instrument  including observable market data  indications of market liquidity and orderliness  and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used 
based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category  judgments are made regarding the significance of the level inputs to the instruments fair value measurement in its entirety 
if level inputs are considered significant  the instrument is classified as level the process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions 
our financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis represented approximately of our total reported assets of billion as of december   compared with of our total reported assets of billion as of december  financial assets for which the fair value was determined using significant level inputs represented approximately of these financial instruments of total assets as of december   and approximately of these financial instruments of total assets as of december  the decreases in the percentage of financial instruments measured at a fair value on a recurring basis and in the percentage of financial instruments measured using level inputs were primarily attributable to the increase in our assets from the adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards  as the consolidated loans are generally classified as held for investment and are therefore not measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
we discuss changes in the valuation inputs and assumptions used in determining the fair value of our financial instruments  including the extent to which we have relied on significant unobservable inputs to estimate fair value and our process for corroborating these inputs  in note fair value of financial instruments 

table of contents allowance for loan and lease losses our allowance for loan and lease losses provides for probable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of each balance sheet date 
we have an established process  using analytical tools  benchmarks and management judgment  to determine our allowance for loan and lease losses 
we calculate the allowance for loan and lease losses by estimating probable losses separately for segments of our loan portfolio with similar risk characteristics 
we generally review and assess our allowance methodologies and adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses on a quarterly basis 
our assessment involves evaluating many factors including  but not limited to  historical loss experience  recent trends in delinquencies and charge offs  risk ratings  the impact of bankruptcy filings  deceased and recovered amounts  the value of collateral underlying secured loans  account seasoning  changes in our credit evaluation  underwriting and collection management policies  seasonality  general economic conditions  changes in the legal and regulatory environment and uncertainties in forecasting and modeling techniques used in estimating our allowance for loan and lease losses 
key factors that have a significant impact on our allowance for loan and lease losses include assumptions about unemployment rates  home prices  and the valuation of commercial properties  consumer real estate  and automobiles 
although we examine a variety of externally available data  as well as our internal loan performance data  to determine our allowance for loan and lease losses  our estimation process is subject to risks and uncertainties  including a reliance on historical loss and trend information that may not be representative of current conditions and indicative of future performance 
accordingly  our actual credit loss experience may not be in line with our expectations 
for example  as a result of improving credit performance trends during  charge offs began to decrease and we recorded a significant allowance release of billion 
we provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for loan and lease losses for each of our loan portfolio segments in note summary of significant accounting policies 
we provide information on the components of our allowance  disaggregated by impairment methodology  and changes in our allowance in note allowance for loan and lease losses 
asset impairment we review other assets for impairment on a regular basis 
this process requires significant management judgment and involves various estimates and assumptions 
our investment securities and goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of our other assets 
accordingly  below we describe our process for assessing impairment of these assets and the key estimates and assumptions involved in this process 
investment securities we regularly review investment securities for other than temporary impairment using both quantitative and qualitative criteria 
effective april   the financial accounting standards board fasb amended and modified the requirements for recognizing and measuring other than temporary impairment for debt securities 
if we intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell a security before its anticipated recovery  the entire difference between the amortized cost basis of the security and its fair value is recognized in earnings 
if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost  we evaluate other qualitative criteria to determine whether a credit loss exists 
our evaluation requires significant management judgment and a consideration of many factors  including  but not limited to  the extent and duration of the impairment  the health of and specific prospects for the issuer  including whether the issuer has failed to make scheduled interest or principal payments  recent events specific to the issuer and or industry to which the issuer belongs  the payment structure of the security  external credit ratings  the value of underlying collateral and current market conditions 
quantitative criteria include assessing whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows 
for equity securities  our evaluation criteria include the length of time and magnitude of the amount that each security is in an unrealized loss position

goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of our acquisitions  principally hibernia corporation in  north fork bancorporation in  and chevy chase bank in  we have goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill resulting from business combinations prior to january  represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill resulting from business combinations after january   is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred  plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree  over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date 
we had goodwill of billion recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as of both december  and other intangible assets consist primarily of core deposit intangibles 
other intangible assets  which we report on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other assets  totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
goodwill and other intangible assets together represented of our total assets as of december   compared with of total assets as of december  
table of contents goodwill is not amortized but must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment on an annual basis or in interim periods if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment 
a reporting unit is a business segment or one level below 
our reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing are domestic card  international card  auto finance  other consumer banking and commercial banking 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment test for all reporting units as of october each year using a two step process 
first  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its current carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of the carrying value  the related goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no further analysis is necessary 
if  however  the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  there is an indication of potential impairment and a second step of testing is performed to measure the amount of impairment  if any  for that reporting unit 
estimating the fair value of reporting units and the assets  liabilities and intangible assets of a reporting unit is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments  particularly related to cash flows  the appropriate discount rates and an applicable control premium 
management judgment is required to assess whether the carrying value of the reporting unit can be supported by the fair value of the individual reporting unit 
there are widely accepted valuation methodologies  such as the market approach earnings multiples and or transaction multiples and or discounted cash flow methods  that are used to estimate the fair value of reporting units 
in applying these methodologies  we utilize a number of factors  including actual operating results  future business plans  economic projections  and market data 
we also may engage an independent valuation specialist to assist in our valuation process 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting units in step one of the goodwill impairment analysis  fair values can be sensitive to changes in the projected cash flows and assumptions 
in some instances  minor changes in the assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount 
furthermore  a prolonged decrease or increase in a particular assumption could eventually lead to the fair value of a reporting unit being less than its carrying amount 
also  to the extent step two of the goodwill analysis is required  changes in the estimated fair values of individual assets and liabilities may impact other estimates of fair value for assets or liabilities and result in a different amount of implied goodwill  and ultimately the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
in conducting our goodwill impairment test for  we determined the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis  a form of the income approach 
our discounted cash flow analysis required management to make judgments about future loan and deposit growth  revenue growth  credit losses  and capital rates 
we relied on each reporting unit s internal cash flow forecast and calculated a terminal value using a growth rate that reflected the nominal growth rate of the economy as a whole and appropriate discount rates for the respective reporting units 
we adjusted cash flows as necessary to maintain each reporting unit s equity capital requirements 
the cash flows were discounted to present value using reporting unit specific discount rates that were largely based on our external cost of equity  adjusted for risks inherent in each reporting unit 
we corroborated the key inputs used in our discounted cash flow analysis with market data  where available  to validate that our assumptions were within a reasonable range of observable market data 
based on the results of step one of our goodwill impairment test  we determined that the carrying amount of each of our reporting units  including goodwill  exceeded the fair value 
accordingly  the goodwill of our reporting units was considered not impaired  and the second step of impairment testing was not required 
however  assuming all other factors were held constant  a decline in the fair value of the domestic card reporting unit  a decline in the fair value of the international card reporting unit  a decline in the fair value of the auto finance reporting unit  a decline in the fair value of the commercial banking reporting unit and a decline in the fair value of the other consumer banking reporting unit would have caused the carrying amount for those reporting units to be in excess of fair value which would require the second step to be performed 
as part of the annual goodwill impairment test  we assessed our market capitalization based on the average market price relative to the aggregate fair value of our reporting units and determined that any excess fair value in our reporting units at that time could be attributed to a reasonable control premium compared to historical control premiums seen in the industry 
during  the lack of liquidity in the financial markets and the continued economic deterioration led to a decline in market capitalization resulting in significantly higher control premiums than what had been seen historically 
throughout  our capitalization rate increased resulting in a decline in our implied control premium 
we will continue to regularly monitor our market capitalization in  overall economic conditions and other events or circumstances that may result in an impairment of goodwill in the future 

table of contents intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated lives and evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset s or asset group s carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
an impairment loss  generally calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of an asset or asset group  is recognized if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value 
we did not recognize impairment on our other intangible assets in  or we provide additional information on the nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets  including the process and methodology used to conduct goodwill impairment testing  in note goodwill and other intangible assets 
representation and warranty reserve in connection with their sales of mortgage loans  certain subsidiaries entered into agreements containing varying representations and warranties about  among other things  the ownership of the loan  the validity of the lien securing the loan  the loan s compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the purchaser  including underwriting guidelines and the ongoing existence of mortgage insurance  and the loan s compliance with applicable federal  state and local laws 
we may be required to repurchase the mortgage loan  indemnify the investor or insurer  or reimburse the investor for credit losses incurred on the loan in the event of a material breach of contractual representations or warranties 
we have established representation and warranty reserves for losses that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable associated with the mortgage loans sold by each subsidiary  including both litigation and non litigation liabilities 
the reserve setting process relies heavily on estimates  which are inherently uncertain  and requires the application of judgment 
in establishing the representation and warranty reserves  we consider a variety of factors  depending on the category of purchaser and rely on historical data 
we evaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis 
during the first and second quarters of  we made significant refinements to our process for estimating our representation and warranty reserve  due primarily to increased counterparty activity and our ability to extend the timeframe over which we estimate our repurchase liability for mortgage loans sold by our subsidiaries to gses and those mortgage loans placed into active insured securitizations for the full life of the mortgage loans 
prior to the second quarter of  we generally estimated the amount of probable repurchase requests to be received over the next months 
as a result of these refinements  we recorded a substantial increase in our representation and warranty repurchase reserve in the first and second quarters of approximately million of the million of provision for representation and warranty reserves recorded in resulted from our extension of repurchase liability estimates to the life of the loan effective in the second quarter of the remaining million related primarily to changing counterparty activity in the form of updated estimates around active and probable litigation  most of which occurred in the first quarter of our aggregate representation and warranty mortgage repurchase reserves  which we report as a component of other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  totaled million as of december   compared with million as of december  the adequacy of the reserves and the ultimate amount of losses incurred by us or one of our subsidiaries will depend on  among other things  actual future mortgage loan performance  the actual level of future repurchase and indemnification requests  the actual success rates of claimants  developments in litigation  actual recoveries on the collateral and macroeconomic conditions including unemployment levels and housing prices 
see consolidated balance sheet analysis and credit performance potential mortgage representation warranty liabilities below and note commitments  contingencies and guarantees for additional information 
revenue recognition we recognize earned finance charges  interest income and fees on loans in interest income in accordance with the contractual provisions of the credit arrangements 
interest and fees continue to accrue on past due loans until the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status  if applicable 
interest and fees accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status are reversed against earnings 
finance charges and fees on credit card loans are included in loan receivables when billed to the customer 
we continue to accrue finance charges and fees on credit card loans until the account is charged off 
however  when we do not expect full payment of billed finance charges and fees  we reduce the balance of our credit card loan receivables by the amount of finance charges billed but not expected to be collected and exclude this amount from interest income 
revenue was reduced by million  billion and billion in  and  respectively  for the estimated uncollectible portion of billed finance charges and fees 
our methodology for estimating the uncollectible portion of billed finance charges and fees is consistent with the methodology we use to estimate the allowance for incurred principal losses on our credit card loan receivables 
accordingly  the estimation process is subject to similar risks and uncertainties  including a reliance on historical loss and trend information that may not be representative of current conditions and indicative of future performance 
changes in key assumptions may have a material impact on the amount of billed finance charges and fees we estimate as uncollectible in each period 

table of contents derivative instruments and hedging activities we primarily use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate risk  and to a lesser extent  foreign currency risk 
our derivatives are designated as either qualifying accounting hedges or free standing derivatives 
free standing derivatives consist of customer accommodation derivatives and economic hedges that we enter into for risk management purposes that are not linked to specific assets or liabilities or to forecasted transactions and  therefore  do not qualify for hedge accounting 
qualifying accounting hedges are designated as fair value hedges  cash flow hedges or net investment hedges 
although all derivative financial instruments  whether designated for hedge accounting or not  are reported at their fair value on our consolidated balance sheets  the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivative instruments differs based on whether the derivative has been designated as a qualifying accounting hedge and the type of accounting hedge 
to obtain and maintain hedge accounting  we must be able to establish at inception that the hedging instrument is effective at offsetting the risk of the hedged item both retrospectively and prospectively  and ensure documentation meets stringent requirements 
the process to test effectiveness requires applying judgment and estimation  including the number of data points to test to ensure adequate and appropriate measurement to confirm or dispel hedge effectiveness and valuation of data within effectiveness tests where external existing data available do not perfectly match the company s circumstances 
without hedge accounting  we may experience significant volatility in our earnings as we would be required to recognize all changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments in earnings 
we provide detail on derivatives gains and losses recognized in our earnings in  and and amounts related to cash flow hedges recorded in aoci as of december  in note derivative instruments and hedging activities 
income taxes our annual income tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities 
significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions  including evaluating uncertainties 
we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 
deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years 
such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources  including reversal of taxable temporary differences  forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies 
these sources of income rely heavily on estimates 
we use our historical experience and our short and long range business forecasts to provide insight 
amounts recorded for deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances  were billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
we had recorded a valuation allowance of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we currently expect to fully recover the net deferred tax asset amounts at the end of within the applicable statutory expiration periods 
to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered  a valuation allowance is established 
if changes in circumstances lead us to change our judgment about our ability to realize deferred tax assets in future years  we would adjust our valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs and record a corresponding increase or charge to income 
we provide additional information on income taxes in consolidated results of operations financial performance and in note income taxes 
recent accounting pronouncements new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting pronouncements may have a significant effect on our results of operations  financial condition  stockholders equity  capital ratios or business operations 
as discussed above  effective january   we adopted two new accounting standards that had a significant impact on the manner in which we account for our securitization transactions  our consolidated financial statements and our capital ratios 
these new accounting standards eliminated the concept of qualified special purpose entities qspes  revised the accounting for transfers of financial assets and changed the consolidation criteria for variable interest entities vies 
under the new accounting guidance  the determination to consolidate a vie is based on a qualitative assessment of which party to the vie has power combined with potentially significant benefits or losses  instead of the previous quantitative risks and rewards model 
consolidation is required when an entity has the power to direct matters which significantly impact the economic performance of the vie  together with either the obligation to absorb losses or the rights to receive benefits that could be significant to the vie 
the prospective adoption of this new accounting guidance resulted in our consolidating substantially all our existing securitization trusts that had previously been off balance sheet and eliminated sales treatment for new transfers of loans to securitization trusts 

table of contents we provide additional information on the impact of these new accounting standards above in impact from adoption of new consolidation accounting standards and in note summary of significant accounting policies 
we also identify and discuss the impact of other significant recently issued accounting pronouncements  including those not yet adopted  in note summary of significant accounting policies 
off balance sheet arrangements and variable interest entities in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in various types of transactions with limited liability companies  partnerships or trusts that often involve special purpose entities spes and vies 
some of these arrangements are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or may be recorded in amounts different from the full contract or notional amount of the transaction  depending on the nature or structure of  and accounting required to be applied to  the arrangement 
these arrangements may expose us to potential losses in excess of the amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets 
our involvement in these arrangements can take many forms  including securitization and servicing activities  the purchase or sale of mortgage backed or other asset backed securities in connection with our home loan portfolio  and loans to vies that hold debt  equity  real estate or other assets 
under previous accounting guidance  we were not required to consolidate the majority of our securitization trusts because they were qspes 
accordingly  we considered these trusts to be off balance sheet arrangements 
in june  the fasb issued two new accounting standards that eliminated the concept of qspes  revised the accounting for transfers of financial assets and changed the consolidation criteria for vies 
as discussed above in impact from adoption of new consolidation accounting standards  we prospectively adopted these new standards on january   which resulted in the consolidation of our credit card securitization trusts  one installment loan trust  certain option arm loan trusts originated by chevy chase bank for which we provide servicing and certain affordable housing entities 
all of our remaining securitization trusts were consolidated or liquidated as of december  our continuing involvement in unconsolidated vies primarily consists of certain mortgage loan trusts and community reinvestment and development entities 
the carrying amount of assets and liabilities of these unconsolidated vies was billion and million  respectively  as of december   and our maximum exposure to loss was billion 
we provide a discussion of our activities related to these vies in note variable interest entities and securitizations 
consolidated results of operations financial performance as indicated above under impact from adoption of new consolidation accounting standards  our reported results subsequent to january  are not presented on a basis consistent with our reported results prior to january  as a result of our adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards 
our reported results subsequent to january  are more comparable to our managed results because we assumed for our managed based reporting that our securitized loans had not been sold and that the earnings from securitized loans were classified in our results of operations in the same manner as the earnings on loans that we owned 
accordingly  the section below provides a comparative discussion of our reported consolidated results of operations for and our managed results for and our net income on a managed basis in and is the same as our reported net income  however  there are differences in the classification of certain amounts in our managed income statement  which we identify in our discussion 
see exhibit for a reconciliation of our non gaap managed based information for periods prior to january  to the most comparable reported us gaap information 
net interest income net interest income represents the difference between the interest income and applicable fees earned on our interest earning assets  which includes loans held for investment and investment securities  and the interest expense on our interest bearing liabilities  which includes interest bearing deposits  senior and subordinated notes  securitized debt and other borrowings 
we include in interest income any past due fees on loans that we deem are collectible 
our net interest margin represents the difference between the yield on our interest earning assets and the cost of our interest bearing liabilities  including the impact of non interest bearing funding 
prior to the adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards on january   our reported net interest income did not include interest income from loans in our off balance sheet securitization trusts or the interest expense on third party debt issued by these securitization trusts 
beginning january   servicing fees  finance charges  other fees  net charge offs and interest paid to third party investors related to consolidated securitization trusts are included in net interest income

table of contents our reported net interest income of billion in increased by from managed net interest income of billion in  driven by a basis points expansion of our net interest margin to  which was partially offset by a decrease in average interest earning assets 
the increase in net interest margin in was primarily attributable to a significant reduction in our average cost of funds  coupled with an increase in the average yield on interest earning assets 
our cost of funds continued to benefit from the shift in the mix of our funding to lower cost consumer and commercial banking deposits from higher cost wholesale sources 
also  the overall interest rate environment  combined with our disciplined pricing  drove a decrease in our average deposit interest rates 
the increase in the average yield on our interest earning assets during reflected the benefit of pricing changes that we implemented during  which contributed to an increase in the average yield on our loan portfolio  as well as improved credit conditions  which has allowed us to recognize a greater proportion of previously reserved uncollected finance charges into income 
the decrease in average interest earning assets resulted from the run off of loans in business that we exited or repositioned  elevated charge offs and weak consumer demand 
our managed net interest income of billion in increased by from managed net interest income of billion in  driven by a basis points expansion of our net interest margin to and a increase in our average interest earning assets 
the increase was largely due to a reduction in our average cost of funds  attributable to the low interest rate environment and shift in our funding mix to lower cost deposits 
non interest income non interest income consists of servicing and securitizations income  service charges and other customer related fees  interchange income and other non interest income 
we also record the mortgage loan repurchase provision related to continuing operations in non interest income 
prior to the adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards on january   our reported non interest income included servicing fees  finance charges  other fees  net charge offs and interest paid to third party investors related to our securitization trusts as a component of non interest income 
in addition  when we created securitization trusts  we recognized gains or losses on the transfer of loans to these trusts and recorded our initial retained interests in the trusts 
effective january   unless we qualify for sale accounting under the new consolidation accounting standards  we no longer recognize a gain or loss or record retained interests when we transfer loans into securitization trusts 
the servicing fees  finance charges  other fees  net of charge offs and interest paid to third party investors related to our consolidated securitization trusts are now reported as a component of net interest income instead of as a component of non interest income

non interest income of billion in decreased by billion  or  from managed non interest income of billion in managed non interest income of billion in decreased by million  or  from managed non interest income of billion in the billion decrease in non interest income in from was primarily attributable to a reduction in over limit fees as result of provisions under the card act  a decline in the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights due to the run off of our home loan portfolio  and an increase in the provision for mortgage loan repurchases 
we recorded a provision for mortgage loan repurchase losses of million in  million of which was included in non interest income  and a provision of million in  of which million was included in non interest income 
we provide additional information on representation and warranty claims in critical accounting polices and estimates and in consolidated balance sheet analysis and credit performance potential mortgage representation and warranty liabilities 

table of contents the net other than temporary impairment losses of million and million recorded in and  respectively  primarily resulted from the deterioration in the credit quality of certain non agency mortgage related securities due to the continued weakness in the housing market and high unemployment 
we also recorded other than temporary impairment on certain other non agency mortgage related securities in because of our intent to sell the securities 
we provide additional information on other than temporary impairment recognized on our available for sale securities in note investment securities 
the million decrease in managed non interest income in from was largely due to reduced service charges and customer related fees as a result of lower overlimit and cash advance fees 
provision for loan and lease losses we build our allowance for loan and lease losses through the provision for loan and lease losses 
our provision for loan and lease losses in each period is driven by charge offs and the level of allowance for loan and lease losses that we determine is necessary to provide for probable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of each balance sheet date 
we recorded a reported provision for loan and lease losses of billion in  compared with a reported provision for loan and lease losses of billion in and billion in our managed provision for loan and lease losses totaled billon and billon in and  respectively 
the significant decrease in the managed provision expense for loan and lease losses in was attributable to reduced charge offs and continued improvement in credit performance  as well as a reduction in our loan portfolio balance 
as a result  we recorded a significant reduction in our allowance for loan and lease losses during the decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses in from was largely due to a significant decline in our loan portfolio balance

in  we completed the restructuring of our operations that was initiated in to improve our competitive cost position as well as reduce certain expenses 
non interest expense of billion in was down million  or  from the decrease was primarily due to the absence of a goodwill impairment charge of million recorded in  as well as a reduction in marketing expenditures during in response to the severe economic downturn 
the goodwill impairment charge in was attributable to the auto finance division of our consumer banking business and reflected a reduction in the estimated fair value of this business due to our strategic decision to scale back origination volume 
income taxes our effective income tax rate based on income from continuing operations was  and in  and  respectively 
the variance in our effective tax rate between periods is due  in part  to fluctuations in our pre tax earnings  which affects the relative tax benefit of tax exempt income  tax credits and permanent tax items 
the increase in our effective tax rate in from reflected the reduced relative benefit of tax exempt income and tax credits as a result of the increase in our pre tax earnings 
we recorded a million tax benefit primarily related to the settlement of certain pre acquisition tax liabilities related to north fork and the resolution of certain tax issues before the us tax court in  which partially offset the increase in our effective tax rate for this period 
the significant decrease in our effective income tax rate in from was primarily attributable to the goodwill impairment charge of million recorded in  a portion of which was non deductible

business segment financial performance our principal operations are currently organized into three major business segments  which are defined based on the products and services provided  or the type of customer served credit card  consumer banking and commercial banking 
the operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments 
the results of our individual businesses  which we report on a continuing operations basis  reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources 
our business segment results are intended to reflect each segment as if it were a stand alone business 
we use an internal management and reporting process to derive our business segment results 
our internal management and reporting process employs various allocation methodologies  including funds transfer pricing  to assign certain managed balance sheet assets  deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment 

table of contents we refer to the business segment results derived from our internal management accounting and reporting process as our managed presentation  which differs in some cases from our reported results prepared based on us gaap 
there is no comprehensive  authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to us gaap  therefore  the managed basis presentation of our business segment results may not be comparable to similar information provided by other financial service companies 
in addition  our individual business segment results should not be used as a substitute for comparable results determined in accordance with us gaap 
we provide additional information on our business segments  including the basis of presentation  business segment reporting methodologies  and a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated results in note business segments 
we summarize our business segment results for  and in the tables below and provide a comparative discussion of these results 
we may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment

our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming  by loan category  are as follows credit card loans as permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec  our policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being classified as nonperforming as these loans are generally charged off in the period the account becomes days past due 
consistent with industry conventions  we generally continue to accrue interest and fees on delinquent credit card loans until the loans are charged off 
when we do not expect full payment of billed finance charges and fees  we reduce the balance of the credit card account by the estimated uncollectible portion of any billed finance charges and fees and exclude this amount from revenue 
consumer loans we classify other non credit card consumer loans as nonperforming at the earlier of the date when we determine that the collectability of interest or principal on the loan is not reasonably assured or when the loan is days past due for automobile and mortgage loans  days past due for unsecured small business revolving lines of credit and days past due for all other non credit card consumer loans  including installment loans 
commercial loans we classify commercial loans as nonperforming at the earlier of the date we determine that the collectability of interest or principal on the loan is not reasonably assured or the loan is days past due 
modified loans and troubled debt restructurings modified loans  including tdrs  that are current at the time of the restructuring remain on accrual status if there is demonstrated performance prior to the restructuring and continued performance under the modified terms is expected 
otherwise  the modified loan is classified as nonperforming and placed on nonaccrual status until the borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance over several payment cycles  generally six months of consecutive payments  under the modified terms of the loan 
purchased credit impaired loans pci loans primarily include loans acquired from chevy chase bank  which we recorded at fair value at acquisition 
because the initial fair value of these loans included an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans  our subsequent accounting for pci loans differs from the accounting for non pci loans 
we therefore separately track and report pci loans and exclude these loans from our delinquency and nonperforming loan statistics

table of contents the increase in our nonperforming loan ratio to as of december   from as of december  was primarily attributable to the weak economy  decline in property values and high unemployment  which continued to have an adverse impact on our commercial and home loan portfolios

net charge offs net charge offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine are uncollectible  net of recovered amounts 
we exclude accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and fraud losses from charge offs 
charge offs are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for loan and lease losses and subsequent recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses 
costs incurred to recover charged off loans are recorded as collection expense and included in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non interest expense 
our charge off time frame for loans  which varies based on the loan type  is presented below 
credit card loans we generally charge off credit card loans when the account is days past due from the statement cycle date 
credit card loans in bankruptcy are charged off within days of receipt of a complete bankruptcy notification from the bankruptcy court  except for uk credit card loans  which are charged off within days 
credit card loans of deceased account holders are charged off within days of receipt of notification 
consumer loans we generally charge off consumer loans at the earlier of the date when the account is a specified number of days past due or upon repossession of the underlying collateral 
our charge off time frame is days for mortgage loans and unsecured small business lines of credit and days for auto and other non credit card consumer loans 
we calculate the charge off amount for mortgage loans based on the difference between our recorded investment in the loan and the fair value of the underlying property and estimated selling costs as of the date of the charge off 
we update our home value estimates on a regular basis and recognize additional charge offs for declines in home values below our initial fair value and selling cost estimate at the date mortgage loans are charged off 
consumer loans in bankruptcy  except for auto and mortgage loans  generally are charged off within days of receipt of notification from the bankruptcy court 
auto and mortgage loans in bankruptcy are charged off in the period that the loan is both days or more past due and days or more past the bankruptcy notification date or in the period the loan becomes days past due for auto loans and days past due for mortgage loans regardless of the bankruptcy notification date 
consumer loans of deceased account holders are charged off within days of receipt of notification 
commercial loans we charge off commercial loans in the period we determine that the unpaid principal loan amounts are uncollectible 
purchased credit impaired loans we do not record charge offs on purchased credit impaired loans that are performing in accordance with or better than our expectations as of the date of acquisition  as the fair values of these loans already reflect a credit component

the overall decrease in net charge offs in from reflects the ongoing improvement in credit performance since the end of  as well as declining loan balances 
the overall increase in net charge offs in from was predominately due to the continued economic downturn  which persisted in loan modifications and restructurings as part of our customer retention efforts  we may modify loans for certain borrowers who have demonstrated performance under the previous terms 
as part of our loss mitigation efforts  we may make loan modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty that are intended to minimize our economic loss and avoid the need for foreclosure or repossession of collateral 
we may provide short term three to twelve months or long term greater than twelve months modifications to improve the long term collectability of the loan 
our most common types of modifications include a reduction in the borrower s initial monthly or quarterly principal and interest payment through an extension of the loan term  a reduction in the interest rate  or a combination of both 
these modifications may result in our receiving the full amount due  or certain installments due  under the loan over a period of time that is longer than the period of time originally provided for under the terms of the loan 
in some cases  we may curtail the amount of principal owed by the borrower 
loan modifications in which an economic concession has been granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty are accounted for and reported as troubled debt restructurings tdrs

the outstanding balance of loan modifications made to assist borrowers experiencing financial difficulties increased to billion as of december   from million as december  of these modifications  approximately million  or  were classified as nonperforming as of december   compared with million  or  as of december  credit card loan modifications have accounted for the substantial majority of our loan modifications  representing million  or  of the outstanding balance of total modified loans as of december   and million  or  of the outstanding balance of total modified loans as of december  the vast majority of our credit card loan modifications involve a reduction in the interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding months 
in all cases  we cancel the customer s available line of credit on the credit card 
if the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms  then the credit card loan agreement will revert back to its original payment terms  with the amount of any loan outstanding reflected in the appropriate delinquency bucket 
the loan amount may then be charged off in accordance with our standard charge off policy 

table of contents we typically measure the re performance rate of modified credit card loans over a year period 
five years after starting a credit card modification  approximately of the balances of modified loans are paid off in full and approximately are charged off 
based on our experience to date  we believe that credit losses are lower for credit card loans that have been modified than those of similar accounts that were not modified 
we therefore plan to ramp up our short term credit card loan modification programs and continue our long term programs 
mortgage loan modifications represented million  or  of the outstanding balance of total modified loans as of december   compared with million  or  of the outstanding balance of total modified loans as of december  approximately of our modified mortgage loans include reduction in the contractual interest rate  approximately include a term extension and approximately include a principal reduction 
the majority of our modified mortgage loans involve a combination of an interest rate reduction  term extension or principal reduction 
because many of the mortgage loan modification programs have been recently launched and we have had a limited number of modifications under these programs  we do not have sufficient history to fully assess the long term performance of modified mortgage loans 
of the modified mortgage loans outstanding as of december   approximately were days or more delinquent 
commercial loan modifications represented million  or  of the outstanding balance of total modified loans as of december   compared with million  or  of the outstanding balance of total modified loans as of december  the vast majority of modified commercial loans include a reduction in interest rate or a term extension 
because we have had only a limited number of commercial loan modifications and the structure of each loan varies  the ultimate success of our commercial loan modifications is uncertain 
of the modified commercial loans outstanding as of december   approximately were days or more delinquent 
impaired loans a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan 
loans defined as individually impaired  based on applicable accounting guidance  include larger balance commercial nonperforming loans and tdr loans 
we do not report nonperforming consumer loans that have not been modified in a tdr as individually impaired  as we collectively evaluate these smaller balance homogenous loans for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 
held for sale loans are also not reported as impaired  as these loans are recorded at lower of cost or fair value 
impaired loans also exclude loans acquired from chevy chase bank because these loans were recorded at fair value upon acquisition and loans held for sale because these loans are recorded at lower of cost or fair value 
impaired loans  including tdrs  totaled billion as of december   compared with billion as of december  tdrs accounted for billion and million of impaired loans as of december  and  respectively 
we provide additional information on our impaired loans  including the allowance established for these loans  in note loans and note allowance for loan and lease losses 
purchased credit impaired loans purchased credit impaired loans decreased to billion as of december   from billion as of december  our portfolio of purchased credit impaired loans consists of loans acquired in the chevy chase bank transaction  which were recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition 
the fair value of these loans included an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans 
therefore  no allowance for loan and lease losses was recorded for these loans as of the acquisition date 
however  we regularly update the amount of expected principal and interest to be collected from these loans and evaluate the results on an aggregated pool basis for loans with common risk characteristics 
if we determine that it is probable that the amount of expected cash flows for any pool is less than our recorded investment  we would recognize impairment through our provision for loan and lease losses 
during  we recorded impairment of million related to certain loan pools 
the credit performance of the remaining pools has generally been in line with or  in some instances  better than we originally expected at the acquisition date 
as a result  we reclassified million from the nonaccretable difference to accretable yield during this increase in accretable yield will be recognized in interest income over the remaining life of these loans 
we provide additional information on the loans acquired from chevy chase bank in note loans 

table of contents allowance for loan and lease losses our allowance for loan and lease losses represents management s best estimate of incurred loan and lease credit losses inherent in our held for investment portfolio as of each balance sheet date 
we do not maintain an allowance for held for sale loans or purchased credit impaired loans that are performing in accordance with or better than our expectations as of the date of acquisition  as the fair values of these loans already reflect a credit component 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is increased through the provision for loan and lease losses and reduced by net charge offs 
the provision for loan and lease losses  which is charged to earnings  reflects credit losses we believe have been incurred and will eventually be reflected over time in our charge offs

as permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the ffeic  our policy is generally not to classify credit card loans as nonperforming 
we accrue interest on credit card loans through the date of charge off  typically in the period that the loan becomes days past due 
the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans  excluding the allowance related to our credit card loans  was as of december  and as of december  as a result of our prospective adoption on january  of the new consolidation accounting standards  we added to our consolidated balance sheet billion of assets and billion of related allowance for loan and lease losses  consisting primarily of credit card loan receivables underlying our consolidated securitization trusts 
our allowance for loan and lease losses  after taking into consideration the billion addition from the january  adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards and subsequent related adjustments  decreased by billion during to billion 
the reduction in our allowance reflected the continued improvement in credit performance trends across our portfolios as a result of the slowly improving economy coupled with actions we have taken over the past several years to tighten our underwriting standards and exit certain portfolios 
while we reduced the amount of our allowance for loan and lease losses in  our allowance as a percentage of our total loan portfolio also decreased to as of december   from as of december  
table of contents deposits our deposits have become our largest source of funding for our operations and asset growth 
total deposits increased by billion  or  in  to billion as of december  from billion as of december  the increase in deposits was primarily driven by increases of billion  billion  and billion in savings accounts  money market deposits  and non interest bearing deposits  respectively  which was partially offset by a decrease of billion in other consumer time deposits and billion in certificates of deposit of  or more  reflecting our shift to more relationship driven  lower cost liquid savings and transaction accounts 
we provide additional information on deposits  including the composition of our deposits  average outstanding balances  interest expense and yield  below in liquidity and funding 
senior and subordinated notes and other borrowings senior and subordinated notes and other borrowings decreased to billion as of december   from billion as of december  the decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in federal home loan bank fhlb advances 
because of the decrease in our loan portfolio and the increase in deposits during  our funding needs were lower and we reduced our level of borrowings 
we provide additional information on our borrowings in note deposits and borrowings 
securitized debt obligations borrowings owed to securitization investors  after taking into consideration the addition of billion of debt issued to third party investors by securitization trusts that we were required to consolidate on january   as a result of the adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards  decreased by billion to billion as of december   from billion as of january  this decrease was attributable to pay downs and charge offs of the loans underlying the securitization trusts and maturities 
potential mortgage representation warranty liabilities in recent years  we acquired three subsidiaries that originated residential mortgage loans and sold them to various purchasers  including purchasers who created securitization trusts 
these subsidiaries are capital one home loans  which was acquired in february  greenpoint mortgage funding  inc greenpoint  which was acquired in december as part of the north fork acquisition  and chevy chase bank  which was acquired in february and subsequently merged into cona 
in connection with their sales of mortgage loans  the subsidiaries entered into agreements containing varying representations and warranties about  among other things  the ownership of the loan  the validity of the lien securing the loan  the loan s compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the purchaser  including underwriting guidelines and the ongoing existence of mortgage insurance  and the loan s compliance with applicable federal  state and local laws 
the representations and warranties do not address the credit performance of the mortgage loans  but mortgage loan performance often influences whether a claim for breach of representation and warranty will be asserted and has an effect on the amount of any loss in the event of a breach of a representation or warranty 
each of these subsidiaries may be required to repurchase mortgage loans in the event of certain breaches of these representations and warranties 
in the event of a repurchase  the subsidiary is typically required to pay the then unpaid principal balance of the loan together with interest and certain expenses including  in certain cases  legal costs incurred by the purchaser and or others 
the subsidiary then recovers the loan or  if the loan has been foreclosed  the underlying collateral 
the subsidiary is exposed to any losses on the repurchased loans after giving effect to any recoveries on the collateral 
in some instances  rather than repurchase the loans  a subsidiary may agree to make a cash payment to make an investor whole on losses or to settle repurchase claims 
in addition  our subsidiaries may be required to indemnify certain purchasers and others against losses they incur as a result of certain breaches of representations and warranties 
in some cases  the amount of such losses could exceed the repurchase amount of the related loans 
these subsidiaries  in total  originated and sold to non affiliates approximately billion original principal balance of mortgage loans between and  which are the years or vintages with respect to which our subsidiaries have received the vast majority of the repurchase requests and other related claims 
the following table sets forth the original principal balance of mortgage loan originations by vintage for the three general categories of purchasers of mortgage loans 
table of contents table original principal balance of mortgage loans originated and sold to third parties based on category of purchaser dollars in billions total government sponsored enterprises gses insured securitizations uninsured securitizations and other total gses include fannie mae and freddie mac 
between and  our subsidiaries sold an aggregate amount of billion in original principal balance mortgage loans to the gses 
of the billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans sold directly by our subsidiaries to private label purchasers who placed the loans into securitizations supported by bond insurance insured securitizations  approximately billion original principal balance was placed in securitizations as to which the monoline bond insurers have made repurchase requests or loan file requests to one of our subsidiaries active insured securitizations  and the remaining approximately billion original principal balance was placed in securitizations as to which the monoline bond insurers have not made repurchase requests or loan file requests to one of our subsidiaries inactive insured securitizations 
insured securitizations often allow the monoline bond insurer to act independently of the investors 
bond insurers typically have indemnity agreements directly with both the mortgage originators and the securitizers  and they often have super majority rights within the trust documentation that allow them to direct trustees to pursue mortgage repurchase requests without coordination with other investors 
because we do not service most of the loans our subsidiaries sold to others  we do not have complete information about the current ownership of the billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans not sold directly to gses or placed in insured securitizations 
we have determined from third party databases that about billion original principal balance of these mortgage loans are currently held by private label publicly issued securitizations not supported by bond insurance uninsured securitizations 
in contrast with the bond insurers in insured securitizations  investors in uninsured securitizations often face a number of legal and logistical hurdles before they can direct a securitization trustee to pursue mortgage repurchases  including the need to coordinate with a certain percentage of investors holding the securities and to indemnify the trustee for any litigation it undertakes 
an additional approximately billion original principal balance of mortgage loans were initially sold to private investors as whole loans 
of this amount  we believe approximately billion original principal balance of mortgage loans were ultimately purchased by gses 
for purposes of our reserves setting process  we consider these loans to be private label loans rather than gse loans 
we do not have information about the current holders or disposition of the remaining billion original principal balance mortgage loans in this category 
with respect to the billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans originated and sold to others between and  we estimate that approximately billion in unpaid principal balance remains outstanding  approximately billion in losses have been realized  and approximately billion in unpaid principal balance is at least days delinquent 
because we do not service most of the loans we sold to others  we do not have complete information about the underlying credit performance levels of these mortgage loans  but these amounts reflect our best estimates based on available data  including extrapolated estimates for the billion original principal balance of mortgage loans about which we do not have information about the current holders 
these estimates could change as we get additional data or refine our analysis 
as of december   the subsidiaries had open repurchase requests relating to approximately billion original principal balance of mortgage loans as compared with billion as of december  over the last year  the vast majority of new repurchase demands received and  as discussed below  almost all of our million reserves  relate to the billion of original principal balance of mortgage loans originally sold to the gses or to active insured securitizations 
currently  repurchase demands predominantly relate to the and vintages 
we have received relatively few repurchase demands from the and vintages  mostly because greenpoint ceased originating mortgages in august table sets forth information on pending repurchase requests by counterparty category and timing of initial repurchase request 
table of contents table open pipeline all vintages all entities dollars in millions all amounts are original principal balance open claims december  gross new demands received in loans repurchased made whole in demands rescinded in open claims december  gses insured securitizations uninsured securitizations and others total the open pipeline includes all repurchase requests ever received by our subsidiaries where either the requesting party has not formally rescinded the repurchase request and where our subsidiary has not agreed to either repurchase the loan at issue or make the requesting party whole with respect to its losses 
accordingly  repurchase requests denied by our subsidiaries and not pursued by the counterparty remain in the open pipeline 
moreover  repurchase requests submitted by parties without contractual standing to pursue repurchase requests are included within the open pipeline unless the requesting party has formally rescinded its repurchase request 
finally  the amounts reflected in this chart are original principal balance amounts and do not correspond to the losses our subsidiary would incur upon the repurchase of these loans 
activity in relates to repurchase demands from all years 
we have established representation and warranty reserves for losses that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable associated with the mortgage loans sold by each subsidiary  including both litigation and non litigation liabilities 
these reserves are reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities 
the reserve setting process relies heavily on estimates  which are inherently uncertain  and requires the application of judgment 
we evaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis 
we build our representation and warranty reserves through the provision for repurchase losses  which we report in our consolidated statements of income as a component of non interest income for loans originated and sold by chevy chase bank and capital one home loans and as a component of discontinued operations for loans originated and sold by greenpoint 
in establishing the representation and warranty reserves  we consider a variety of factors depending on the category of purchaser 
in establishing reserves for the billion original principal balance of gse loans  we rely on the historical relationship between gse loan losses and repurchase outcomes to estimate the percentage of current and future gse loan defaults that we anticipate will result in repurchase requests from the gses over the lifetime of the gse loans  and the percentage of those repurchase requests that we anticipate will result in actual repurchases 
we also rely on estimated collateral valuations and loss forecast models to estimate our lifetime liability on gse loans 
this reserving approach to the gse loans reflects the historical interaction with the gses around repurchase requests 
the gses have stronger contractual rights than non gse counterparties because gse contracts typically do not contain prompt notice requirements for repurchase requests or materiality qualifications to the representations and warranties 
moreover  although we often disagree with the gses about the validity of their repurchase requests  we have established a negotiation pattern whereby the gses and our subsidiaries continually negotiate around individual repurchase requests  leading to the gses rescinding some repurchase requests and our subsidiaries agreeing in some cases to repurchase some loans or make the gses whole with respect to losses 
our lifetime representation and warranty reserves with respect to gse loans are grounded in this history 
for the billion original principal balance in active insured securitizations  our reserving approach also reflects our historical interaction with monoline bond insurers around repurchase requests 
typically  monoline bond insurers allege a very high repurchase rate with respect to the mortgage loans in the active insured securitization category 
in response to these repurchase requests  our subsidiaries typically request information from the monoline bond insurers demonstrating that the contractual requirements around a valid repurchase request have been satisfied  such as  for example  the typical requirements that the counterparty promptly notify us upon discovery of any breach and that any breach materially and adversely affect the value of the mortgage loan at issue 
in response to these requests for supporting documentation  monoline bond insurers typically initiate litigation 
accordingly  our reserves within the active insured securitization are not based upon the historical repurchase rate with monoline bond insurers  but rather upon the expected resolution of litigation with the monoline bond insurers 
every bond insurer within this category is pursuing a substantially similar litigation strategy either through active or probable litigation 
accordingly  our representation and warranty reserves for this category are litigation reserves 
in establishing litigation reserves for this category  we consider current and future losses inherent within the securitization and apply legal judgment to the anticipated factual and legal record to estimate the lifetime legal liability for each securitization 
our estimated legal liability for each securitization within this category assumes that we will be responsible for only a portion of the losses inherent in each securitization 
our litigation reserves with respect to both the us bank lawsuit and the dbsp lawsuit  in each case as referenced below  are contained within the active insured securitization reserve category 
further  our litigation reserves with respect to indemnification risks from certain representation and warranty lawsuits brought by monoline bond insurers against third party securitizations sponsors  where greenpoint provided some or all of the mortgage collateral within the securitization but is not a defendant in the litigation  are also contained within this category 

table of contents for the billion original principal balance of mortgage loans in the inactive insured securitizations category and the billion original principal balance of mortage loans in the uninsured securitizations and other whole loans sales categories  we establish reserves by relying on our historical repurchase rates to estimate repurchase liabilities over the next twelve months 
we do not believe we can estimate repurchase liability for these categories for a period longer than twelve months because of the relatively sporadic nature of repurchase requests from these categories 
although we have not seen any significant activity from new counterparties from these categories  there has been a recent uptick in negotiation intensity from some counterparties who had submitted repurchase claims in earlier quarters with respect to whole loans 
in addition  some uninsured securitization investors from this category have not made repurchase requests or filed representation and warranty lawsuits  but instead have filed class actions under federal and state securities laws against investment banks and securitization sponsors 
although we face some indemnity risks from these litigations  we have not established reserves with respect to these indemnity risks because we do not consider them to be both probable and reasonably estimable liabilities 
the aggregate reserves for all three subsidiaries were million as of december  as compared with million as of december  we recorded a total provision for repurchase losses for our representation and warranty repurchase exposure of million for the year ended december  during  we had settlements of repurchase requests totaling million that were charged against the reserve

more specifically  of the million increase in representation and warranty reserves for the twelve months ended december   approximately million resulted from our extension of repurchase liability estimates to the life of the loan effective in the second quarter of the remaining million reserve accrual related primarily to changing counterparty activity in the form of updated estimates around active and probable litigation  most of which occurred in the first quarter of as indicated in table  almost all of the reserves relate to the billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans sold directly to the gses and to the billion in mortgage loans sold to purchasers who placed them into active insured securitizations 

table of contents table allocation of representation and warranty reserves december  dollars in millions  except for loans sold loans sold to reserve liability gses and active insured securitizations inactive insured securitizations and others total reflects  in billions  the total original principal balance of mortgage loans originated by our subsidiaries and sold to third party investors between and the adequacy of the reserves and the ultimate amount of losses incurred by our subsidiaries will depend on  among other things  actual future mortgage loan performance  the actual level of future repurchase and indemnification requests including the extent  if any  to which inactive insured securitizations and other currently inactive investors ultimately assert claims  the actual success rates of claimants  developments in litigation  actual recoveries on the collateral and macroeconomic conditions including unemployment levels and housing prices 
as part of our business planning processes  we have considered various outcomes relating to the potential future representation and warranty liabilities of our subsidiaries that are possible but do not arise to the level of being both probable and reasonably estimable outcomes that would justify an incremental reserve accrual under applicable accounting standards 
we believe that the upper end of the reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond the current accrual levels  including reasonably possible future losses relating to the us bank litigation and dbsp litigation  could be as high as billion 
notwithstanding our attempt to estimate a reasonably possible amount of loss beyond our current accrual levels based on current information  it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and the amount of reasonably possible losses estimated here 
there is still significant uncertainty as to numerous factors that contribute to ultimate liability levels  including  but not limited to  litigation outcomes  future repurchase claims levels  ultimate repurchase success rates  and mortgage loan performance levels

risk management our business activities expose us to eight major categories of risks liquidity risk  credit risk  reputational risk  market risk  strategic risk  operational risk  compliance risk and legal risk 
our risk management framework is intended to identify  assess and mitigate risks that affect or have the potential to affect our business in order to target financial returns commensurate with our risk appetite and to avoid excessive risk taking 
we follow four key risk management principles individual businesses take and manage risk in pursuit of strategic  financial and other business objectives 
independent risk management organizations support individual businesses by providing risk management tools and policies and by aggregating risks  in some cases  risks are managed centrally 
the board of directors and senior management review our aggregate risk position  establish the risk appetite and work with management to ensure conformance to policy and adherence to our adopted mitigation strategy 
we employ a top risk identification system to maintain the appropriate focus on the risks and issues that may have the most impact and to identify emerging risks of consequence 
our approach is reflected in four critical risk management practices of particular importance in the financial services industry due to changing regulatory environments and ongoing economic uncertainty 
first  we seek to mitigate liquidity risk strategically and tactically 
from a strategic perspective  we have acquired and built deposit gathering businesses and significantly reduced our loan to deposit ratio 
from a tactical perspective  we have accumulated a very large liquidity reserve comprising cash  high quality  unencumbered securities  and committed collateralized credit lines and conduit facilities 

table of contents second  we recognize that we are exposed to cyclical changes in credit quality 
consequently  we try to ensure our credit portfolio is resilient to economic downturns 
our most important tool is sound underwriting  using what we deem to be conservative assumptions 
in unsecured consumer loan underwriting  we generally assume that loans will be subject to an environment in which losses are significantly higher than those prevailing at the time of underwriting 
in commercial underwriting  we insist on strong cash flow  strong collateral  and strong covenants and guarantees 
in addition to sound underwriting  we aggressively monitor our portfolio and aggressively collect or work out distressed loans 
third  we recognize that reputational risk is of particular concern for financial institutions as a result of the aftermath of the recent financial crisis and economic downturn  which has resulted in increased regulation and widespread regulatory changes 
consequently  our chief executive officer and executive team manage both tactical and strategic reputation issues and build our relationships with the government  media  and other constituencies to help strengthen the reputations of both our company and industry 
our actions include taking public positions in support of better consumer practices in our industry and  where possible  unilaterally implementing those practices in our business 
finally  we recognize that maintaining a strong capital position is essential to our business strategy and competitive position 
while capital is not a risk unto itself  understanding and managing risks to our capital position is an underlying objective of all our risk programs 
stress testing and economic capital measurement  both of which incorporate inputs from across the risk spectrum  are key tools for evaluating our capital position and risk adjusted returns 
we also consider risks to our reputation and to our ability to access capital markets as part of our process for evaluating our capital plans 
see md a liquidity and capital management for additional information on our capital adequacy and strength 
risk management roles and responsibilities the board of directors is responsible for establishing our overall risk framework  approving and overseeing execution of the enterprise risk management policy and key risk category policies  establishing our risk appetite  and regularly reviewing our risk profile 
the chief risk officer  who reports to the ceo  is responsible for overseeing our risk management program and driving appropriate action to resolve any weaknesses 
the risk management program begins with a set of policies and risk appetites approved by the board that are implemented through a system of risk committees and senior executive risk stewards 
we have established risk committees at both the corporate and divisional level to identify and manage risk 
in addition  we have assigned a senior executive expert to each of eight risk categories the risk stewards 
these executive risk stewards work with the chief risk officer and the risk committees to ensure that risks are identified and given appropriate priority and attention 
the chief risk officer aggregates the results of these processes to assemble a view of our risk profile 
both management and the board regularly review the risk profile 
risk management and control framework we use a consistent framework to manage risk 
the framework applies at all levels  from the development of the enterprise risk management program itself to the tactical operations of the front line business team 
the framework has six key elements objective setting  risk assessment  control activities  communication and information  program monitoring  and organization and culture 
objective setting is at the beginning of our risk management approach 
we set strategic  financial  operational  and other objectives during our strategic and annual planning processes and throughout the year 
these objectives cascade through the organization to individual teams of associates 
the risk management approach helps identify and manage risks that have the potential to interfere with the achievement of our stated objectives 
risk assessment is the process of identifying risks to our objectives  evaluating the impact of those risks and choosing and executing on a response 
responses include avoidance  mitigation  or acceptance 
generally  risk responses are guided by our established risk appetite 
for certain risk categories  risk assessment is largely conducted by central risk groups or jointly between business areas and central groups market  liquidity  legal  credit  compliance 
in other risk categories  risk assessment is primarily the responsibility of business areas with more limited central support strategic  operational  reputation 
control activities are the day to day backbone of risk management 
controls provide reasonable assurance that legal  regulatory  and business requirements are being met  and identified risks are being mitigated  avoided  or accepted according to our risk response choices and risk appetite 
we have practices in place designed to ensure key controls are established  evaluated  and effective in preventing a breakdown 
control activities include the monitoring of adherence to current policy and procedure requirements  sign offs  and regular reporting to management 

they also include the resolution of regulatory and audit findings and issues and the procedures that trigger objective setting and risk assessments when new business opportunities are evaluated or business hierarchy changes occur 

table of contents communication and information infrastructures must be solid and are necessary to support the objective setting  risk assessment  and control activities described above 
specific reports and communication infrastructure are defined within our individual risk category policies 
our risk governance structure is designed to support solid and ongoing communication 
robust risk management requires well functioning communication channels to inform associates of their responsibilities  alert them to issues or changes that might affect their activities  and to enable an open flow of information up  down  and across our company 
robust risk management also requires management information to enable controls to work effectively and to support the analysis needed to set objectives and assess risk accurately 
program monitoring is critical to our risk management program overall 
program monitoring assesses the accuracy  sufficiency  and effectiveness of current objectives  risk assessments  controls  ownership  communication  and management support 
the assessment of a risk program or activity can be qualitative or quantitative 
we encourage the use of measurement and metrics  where it is possible and recognizing that some risks or programs cannot be measured quantitatively 
where deficiencies are discovered  we seek to update the risk management program to resolve the deficiencies in a timely manner 
significant deficiencies are escalated to the appropriate risk executive or risk committee 
clear accountability is defined when resolving deficiencies to ensure the desired outcome is achieved 
risk management programs are monitored at every level  from the overall enterprise risk management program to the individual risk management activities in each business area 
organization and culture is intended to create and maintain an effective risk management organization and culture 
a strong organization and culture promotes risk management as a key factor in making important business decisions and helps drive risk management activities deeper into the company 
an effective risk management culture starts with a well defined risk management philosophy 
it requires established risk management objectives that align to business objectives and make targeted risk management activities part of ongoing business management activities 
we believe we staff risk functions at the appropriate levels with qualified associates and effective tools that support risk management practices and activities 
senior management and the board of directors are ultimately accountable for promoting adherence to sound risk principles and tolerances 
we seek to incent associates at all levels to perform according to corporate policies and risk tolerance and in conformity with applicable laws and regulations 
additionally  management tries to ensure that performance goals  plans  and incentives are designed to promote financial performance within the confines of a sound risk management program and within defined risk tolerances 
we have a corporate code of business conduct and ethics the code available on the corporate governance page of our website at www 
capitalone 
com about under which each associate is obligated to behave with integrity in dealing with customers and business partners and to comply with applicable laws and regulations 
we disclose any waivers to the code on our website 
we also have an associate performance management process that emphasizes achieving business results while ensuring integrity  compliance  and sound business management 
risk appetite we have a defined risk appetite for each of our eight risk categories that is approved by the board of directors 
each risk category has its own risk appetite statement 
stated risk appetites  and the assessment framework that support them  define the guardrails for taking and accepting risks and are used by senior management and the board to make business decisions 
the risk appetite framework assesses each risk category across three dimensions  using consistent  comprehensive  and understandable measures 
the three dimensions are net risk assessment of the level of risk given internal and external factors quality of governance and controls evidence demonstrating the strength or weakness of our risk governance structure and or controls associated with the risk category and our ability to address issues mitigation plan status when needed  the status of our key mitigation activity needed to reduce risk all three framework dimensions are assessed and measured using a five point scale 
the assessment language in each scale is customized by each risk steward to reflect the tolerance levels of each of the eight risk categories 

table of contents risk categories our risk management program is organized around eight risk categories 
they are liquidity risk is the risk that future financial obligations are not met or future asset growth cannot occur because of an inability to obtain funds at a reasonable price within a reasonable time 
the chief financial officer is the accountable executive for liquidity risk 
liquidity strength is assessed by evaluating several different balance sheet metrics under severe stress scenarios to ensure we can withstand significant funding degradation in both deposits and capital marketing funding sources 
management reports liquidity metrics to the finance and trust oversight committee of the board no less than quarterly and to asset liability management committee on a monthly basis 
breaches in liquidity metric limits are reported to the treasurer as soon as they are identified and to the asset liability management committee at the next regularly scheduled committee meeting  unless the breach activates the liquidity contingency plan 
breaches are also reported to the finance and trust oversight committee no later than the next regularly scheduled meeting 
detailed processes  requirements and controls are contained in our policies and supporting procedures 
credit risk is the risk of loss from a borrower s failure to meet the terms of any contract or failure to otherwise perform as agreed 
there are four primary sources of credit risk changing economic conditions  which affect borrowers ability to pay and the value of any collateral  a changing competitive environment  which affects customer debt loads  borrowing patterns and loan terms  our underwriting strategies and standards  which determine to whom we offer credit and on what terms  and the quality of our internal controls  which establish a process to test that underwriting conforms to our standards and identifies credit quality issues so we can act upon them in a timely manner 
the chief risk officer is the accountable executive for credit risk 
we have quantitative credit risk guidelines for each of our lines of business 
we conduct portfolio and decision level monitoring and stress tests using economic and legislative stress scenarios 
credit risk objectives are achieved by establishing a credit governance framework and by establishing policies  procedures  and controls for each step in the credit process 
the board  chief executive officer  chief risk officer  chief consumer and commercial credit officers  and division presidents have specific accountable roles in the management of credit risk 
these include policy approval  creation of credit strategy  review of credit position  delegation of authority  and appointments and responsibilities of key executives and credit policy committee members 
our evolving credit risk position and recommendations to address issues are reviewed by management s credit policy committee and the board of directors 
reputation risk is the risk to market value  recruitment  and retention of talented associates and a loyal customer base due to the negative perceptions of our internal and external stakeholders regarding our business strategies and activities 
our general counsel is the accountable executive for reputation risk 
reputation risk associated with daily interactions are managed by our business areas 
business area activities are controlled by the frameworks set forth in the reputation risk policy and other risk management policies 
each business area determines how much risk it is willing to accept and when it is prudent to execute mitigation activities 
the reputation risk management policy sets forth the obligation of each business area  with direction and guidance from the reputation risk steward and his or her designee to identify  assess and determine whether and how best to mitigate its reputation risk 
the reputation risk steward is responsible for reporting on the assessments of our aggregate reputation risk  as well as the state of our reputation with specific stakeholder groups  to the chief risk officer  the chief executive officer  and the risk management committee as appropriate 
market risk is the risk that earnings or the economic value of equity will under perform due to changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates market rates  or other financial market asset prices 
our ability to manage market risks contributes to our overall capital management 
the chief financial officer is the accountable executive for market risk 
the market risk positions of our banking entities and the company are calculated separately and in total and are reported versus pre established limits to the asset liability management committee and the finance and trust oversight committee of the board no less than quarterly 
management is authorized to utilize financial instruments as outlined in our policy to actively manage market risk exposure 
detailed processes  requirements and controls are contained in our policies and supporting procedures 

table of contents strategic risk is the risk that we fail to achieve short and long term business objectives because we fail to develop the products  capabilities  and competitive position necessary to attract consumers  succeed against competitors and withstand market volatility 
the result is a failure to deliver returns expected by stakeholders customers  associates  stockholders  investors  communities  and regulators 
the chief executive officer is the accountable executive for our strategy 
the chief executive officer develops an overall corporate strategy and leads alignment of the entire organization with this strategy through definition of strategic imperatives and top down communication 
the chief executive officer and other senior executives spend significant time throughout the entire company sharing our strategic imperatives to promote an understanding of our strategy and connect it to day to day associate activities to enable effective execution 
division presidents are accountable for defining business strategy within the context of the overall corporate level strategy and strategic imperatives 
business strategies are integrated into the corporate strategic plan and are reviewed and approved separately and together on an annual basis by the chief executive officer and the board of directors 
operational risk is the risk of loss  adverse customer experience  or negative regulatory or reputation impact resulting from failed or inadequate processes  associate capabilities or systems  or exposure to external events 
the chief compliance officer is the accountable executive for establishment of risk management standards and for governance and monitoring of operational risk at a corporate level 
division presidents have primary accountability for management of operational risk within their business areas 
while most operational risks are managed and controlled by business areas  the operational risk management program establishes requirements and control processes that assure certain consistent practices in the management of operational risk  and provides transparency to the corporate operational risk profile 
our operational risk management program also includes two primary additional functions 
operational risk reporting involves independent assessments of the control and sustainability of key business processes at a corporate and business area level  and such assessments are provided to the chief risk officer  management s risk management committee  and the audit and risk committee of the board 
the operational risk capital function  in conjunction with the corporate capital process managed by global finance  establishes necessary operational risk capital levels to assure resiliency against extreme operational risk event scenarios 
operational risk results and trends are reported to the risk management committee and the audit and risk committee of the board 
compliance risk is the risk of financial loss due to regulatory fines or penalties  restriction or suspension of business  or cost of mandatory corrective action as a result of failing to adhere to applicable laws  regulations  principles and supervisory guidance as well as our own internal standards intended to adhere to these laws and regulations 
division presidents are the accountable executives for compliance risk and are responsible for building and maintaining compliance processes 
with the chief compliance officer  division presidents are jointly accountable for ensuring the compliance management program requirements are met for their division 
we ensure compliance by maintaining an effective compliance management program consisting of sound policies  systems  processes  and reports 
the compliance management program provides management with guidance  training  and monitoring to provide reasonable assurance of our compliance with internal and external compliance requirements 
additionally  management and the corporate compliance department jointly and separately conduct on going monitoring and assess the state of compliance 
the assessment provides the basis for performance reporting to management and the board  allows business areas to determine if their compliance performance is acceptable  and confirms effective compliance controls are in place 
business areas embed compliance requirements and controls into their business policies  standards  processes and procedures 
they regularly monitor and report on the efficiency of their compliance controls 
corporate compliance  jointly working with the business  defines and validates a standard compliance monitoring and reporting methodology 
compliance results and trends are reported to management s risk management committee and the audit and risk committee of the board 
legal risk is the risk of material adverse impact due to i new and changed laws and regulations  ii new interpretations of law  iii the drafting  interpretation and enforceability of contracts  iv adverse decisions or consequences arising from litigation or regulatory scrutiny  v the establishment  management and governance of our legal entity structure  and vi the failure to seek or follow appropriate legal counsel when needed 
our general counsel is the accountable executive for monitoring and controlling legal risk 
our legal department serves as our control against legal risk by providing legal evaluation and guidance to the enterprise and business areas 
this evaluation and guidance is based on the assessment of legal counsel of the type and degree of legal risk associated with the internal business area practices and activities and of the controls the business has in place to mitigate legal risks 
legal risk is governed by and defined in our legal risk policy 
liquidity and capital management liquidity we have established liquidity guidelines that are intended to ensure that we have sufficient asset based liquidity to withstand the potential impact of deposit attrition or diminished liquidity in the funding markets 
our guidelines include maintaining an adequate liquidity reserve to cover our potential funding requirements and diversified funding sources to avoid over dependence on volatile  less reliable funding markets 
our liquidity reserves consist of cash and cash equivalents  unencumbered available for sale securities and undrawn committed securitization borrowing facilities 
table below presents the composition of our liquidity reserves as of december  and our liquidity reserves decreased by billion during to billion as of december  table liquidity reserves december  dollars in millions cash and cash equivalents securities available for sale less pledged available for sale securities unencumbered available for sale securities undrawn committed securitization borrowing facilities total liquidity reserves the weighted average life of our available for sale securities was approximately and years as of december  and  respectively 
funding our funding objective is to establish an appropriate maturity profile using a cost effective mix of both short term and long term funds 
we use a variety of funding sources  including deposits  loan securitizations  debt and equity securities  securitization borrowing facilities and fhlb advances 

table of contents deposits our deposits provide a stable and relatively low cost of funds and have become our largest source of funding 
we have expanded our opportunities for deposit growth through direct and indirect marketing channels  our existing branch network and branch expansion 
these channels offer a broad set of deposit products that include demand deposits  money market deposits  negotiable order of withdrawal now accounts  savings accounts and certificates of deposit

based on past activity  we expect to retain a portion of these deposits as they mature 
we have brokered deposits  which we obtained through the use of third party intermediaries that are included above in table in money market deposit accounts and other consumer time deposits 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of limits the use of brokered deposits to well capitalized insured depository institutions and  with a waiver from the federal deposit insurance corporation  to adequately capitalized institutions 
cobna and cona were well capitalized  as defined under the federal banking regulatory guidelines  as of december   and therefore permitted to maintain brokered deposits 
our brokered deposits totaled billion  or of total deposits  as of december  brokered deposits totaled billion  or of total deposits  as of december  based on our historical access to the brokered deposit market  we expect to replace maturing brokered deposits with new brokered deposits or direct deposits and branch deposits

covenants in connection with the issuance of certain of our trust preferred securities  we entered into replacement capital covenants rccs granting certain rights to the holders of covered debt which was defined in the rccs as our subordinated notes due may  the rccs prohibited the repayment  redemption or purchase of the trust preferred securities except  with limited exceptions  to the extent that we received specified amounts of proceeds from the sale of certain qualifying securities 
we commenced a solicitation of consents from the covered debtholders on november   to terminate the rccs 
the rccs were terminated on december   the expiration date of the consent solicitation  at which time we had received the consent of holders of a majority of the principal amount of the covered debt 
the terms of certain lease and credit facility agreements related to other borrowings and operating leases include several financial covenants that require performance measures and equity ratios to be met 
if these covenants are not met  there may be an acceleration of the payment due dates noted in table as of december   we were not in default of any such covenants 
capital the level and composition of our equity capital are determined by multiple factors including our consolidated regulatory capital requirements and an internal risk based capital assessment  and may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines  subsidiary capital requirements  the business environment  conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to adverse changes in our business and market environments 
capital standards and prompt corrective action bank holding companies and national banks are subject to capital adequacy standards adopted by the federal reserve and the occ  respectively 
the capital adequacy standards set forth minimum risk based and leverage capital requirements that are based on quantitative and qualitative measures of their assets and off balance sheet items 
under the capital adequacy standards  bank holding companies and banks currently are required to maintain a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  and a tier leverage capital ratio of at least for banks that meet certain specified criteria  including excellent asset quality  high liquidity  low interest rate exposure and the highest regulatory rating 
under prompt corrective action capital regulations  a bank is considered to be well capitalized if it maintains a total risk based capital ratio of at least basis points higher than the above minimum capital standard  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier leverage capital ratio of at least and not be subject to any supervisory agreement  order  or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital reserve 
a bank is considered to be adequately capitalized if it meets the above minimum capital ratios and does not otherwise meet the well capitalized definition 
currently  prompt corrective action capital requirements do not apply to bank holding companies 
in addition to disclosing our regulatory capital ratios  we also disclose tier common equity and tce ratios  which are non gaap measures widely used by investors  analysts  rating agencies and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies 
there is currently no mandated minimum or well capitalized standard for tier common equity  instead the risk based capital rules state voting common stockholders equity should be the dominant element within tier common equity 
management reviews our tier common equity and tce ratios  along with other measures of capital  as part of its financial analyses and discloses these non gaap capital measures because of current interest in such information on the part of market participants 
please see financial highlights under executive summary and business outlook for more information on our tce ratio

under regulatory guidelines for risk based capital  on balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off balance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories according to the obligor or  if relevant  the guarantor or the nature of any collateral 
the aggregate dollar amount in each risk category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with that category 
the resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories are aggregated for determining total risk weighted assets 
table provides a comparison of our capital ratios under the federal reserve s capital adequacy standards  and the capital ratios of the banks under the occ s capital adequacy standards as of december  and as of december   we exceeded minimum capital requirements and would meet the well capitalized ratio levels specified under prompt corrective action for total risk based capital and tier risk based capital under federal reserve capital standards for bank holding companies 
as of december   the banks also exceeded minimum regulatory requirements under the occ s applicable capital adequacy guidelines and were well capitalized under prompt corrective action requirements

the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action does not apply to capital one financial corp 
because it is a bank holding company 
tier common equity ratio is a non gaap measure calculated based on tier common equity divided by risk weighted assets 
calculated based on tier capital divided by risk weighted assets 
calculated based on total risk based capital divided by risk weighted assets 
calculated based on tier capital divided by quarterly average total assets  after certain adjustments 
the january  adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards resulted in our consolidating a substantial portion of our securitization trusts and establishing an allowance for loan and lease losses for the assets underlying these trusts  which reduced retained earnings and our tier risk based capital ratio 
in january  banking regulators issued regulatory capital rules related to the impact of the new consolidation accounting standards 
under these rules  we are required to hold additional capital for the assets we consolidated 
the capital rules also provided for an optional phase in of the impact from the adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards  including a two quarter implementation delay followed by a two quarter partial implementation of the effect on regulatory capital ratios 
we elected the phase in option  which required us to phase in of consolidated assets beginning with the third quarter of for purposes of determining risk weighted assets 
however  the phase in impact was effectively accelerated over the first three quarters of due to pay downs of outstanding securitization debt

we will incorporate any feedback from our regulators in response to the capital plan review in our ongoing capital management actions 
market risk management market risk generally represents the risk that our earnings and or economic value of equity may be adversely affected by changes in market conditions 
market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities  including loans  deposits  securities  short term borrowings  long term debt and derivatives 
market conditions that may change from time to time  thereby exposing us to market risk  include changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates  credit spreads and price fluctuation or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of issuers 
our most significant market risks include our exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risk 
we have prescribed risk management policies and limits established by our asset liability management committee 
our objective is to manage our asset liability risk position and exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and prescribed limits based on prevailing market conditions and long term expectations 
because no single measure can reflect all aspects of market risk  we use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analyses to measure  assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on our earnings and the economic value of equity 
interest rate risk interest rate risk  which represents exposure to instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates  is our most significant market risk exposure 
banks are inevitably exposed to interest rate risk due to differences in the timing between the maturity or repricing of assets and liabilities 
for example  if more assets are repricing than deposits and other borrowings when general interest rates are declining  our earnings will decrease initially 
similarly  if more deposits and other borrowings are repricing than assets when general interest rates are rising  our earnings will decrease initially 
interest rate risk also results from changes in customer behavior and competitors responses to changes in interest rates or other market conditions 
for example  decreases in mortgage interest rates generally results in faster than expected prepayments  which may adversely affect earnings 
increases in interest rates  coupled with strong demand from competitors for deposits  may influence industry pricing 
such competition may affect customer decisions to maintain balances in the deposit accounts  which may require replacing lower cost deposits with higher cost alternative sources of funding 
we employ several strategies to manage our interest rate risk  which include  but are not limited to  changing the maturity and re pricing characteristics of our various assets and liabilities and using interest rate derivatives 
we consider the impact on both earnings and economic value of equity in measuring and managing our interest rate risk 
our earnings sensitivity measure estimates the impact on net interest income and the valuation of our mortgage servicing rights net of derivatives as a result of movements in interest rates 
our economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact on the net preset value of our assets and liabilities  including derivatives  as a result of movements in interest rates 
our earnings sensitivity and economic value of equity measurements are based on our existing assets and liabilities  including our derivatives  and do not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected plans for funding mix changes 
however  we also assess the potential impact of growth assumptions  changing business activities  alternative interest rate scenarios and changing market environments  which we factor into our interest rate risk management decisions 
under our current asset liability management policy  we seek to limit the potential decrease in our projected net interest income resulting from a gradual plus or minus basis point change in forward rates to less than over the next months 
our current asset liability management policy also includes limiting the adverse change in the economic value of our equity due to an instantaneous parallel interest rate shock to spot rates of plus or minus basis points to less than 
the federal funds rate remained at a target range of zero to throughout given the level of short term rates as of december  and  a scenario where interest rates would decline by basis points is not plausible 
we therefore revised our customary declining interest rate scenario of basis points to a basis point decrease 
table compares the estimated impact on net interest income and the economic value of equity of our selected hypothetical interest rate scenarios as of december  and all changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the projected net interest income and economic value of our equity at the base interest rate scenario 
our earnings and economic value sensitivity measures were low and within our prescribed asset liability policy limits as of december  and 
table of contents table interest rate sensitivity analysis december  impact to projected base line net interest income basis points basis points impact to economic value of equity basis points basis points these sensitivities include our net interest income and mortgage servicing rights valuation change net of hedges 
for net interest income  the rate scenarios are based on a hypothetical gradual increase in interest rates of basis points and a hypothetical gradual decrease of basis points to forward rates over the next months 
for the mortgage servicing rights valuation change net of hedges  the rate scenarios are based on a hypothetical instantaneous parallel rate shock of plus basis points and minus basis points to spot rates 
based on a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates of plus basis points and minus basis points to spot rates 
the interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information  internally developed assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies  which project borrower and deposit behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments 
other market inputs  such as interest rates  market prices and interest rate volatility  are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures 
we regularly evaluate  update and enhance these assumptions  models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities 
there are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates 
the above sensitivity analyses contemplate only certain movements in interest rates and are performed at a particular point in time based on the existing balance sheet  and do not incorporate other factors that may have a significant effect  most notably future business activities and strategic actions that management may take to manage interest rate risk 
actual earnings and economic value of equity could differ from the above sensitivity analyses 
foreign exchange risk we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates  which may impact the earnings of our foreign operations 
our asset liability management policy requires that we use derivatives to hedge material foreign currency denominated transactions to limit our earnings exposure to foreign exchange risk 
the estimated reduction in our month earnings due to adverse foreign exchange rate movements corresponding to a probability was less than as of december  and the precision of this estimate is limited due to the inherent uncertainty of the underlying forecast assumptions 
derivative instruments derivatives are one of the primary tools we use in managing interest rate and foreign exchange risk 
we execute our derivative contracts in both over the counter and exchange traded derivative markets 
although the majority of our derivatives are interest rate swaps  we also use a variety of other derivative instruments  including caps  floors  options  futures and forward contracts  to manage our interest rate and foreign currency risk 
the outstanding notional amount of our derivative contracts totaled billion as of december   compared with billion as of december  see note derivative instruments and hedging activities for additional information on our derivatives activity
