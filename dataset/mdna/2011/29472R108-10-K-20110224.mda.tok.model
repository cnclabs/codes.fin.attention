the company s revenue streams are predominantly derived from customers renting its sites on a long term basis 
the company has approximately  annual sites  approximately  seasonal sites  which are leased to customers generally for three to six months  and approximately  transient sites  occupied by customers who lease sites on a short term basis 
the revenue from seasonal and transient sites is generally higher during the first and third quarters 
the company expects to service over  customers at its transient sites and the company considers this revenue stream to be its most volatile 
it is subject to weather conditions  gas prices  and other factors affecting the marginal rv customer s vacation and travel preferences 
finally  the company has approximately  sites designated as right to use sites  which are primarily utilized to service the approximately  customers who have right to use contracts 
the company also has interests in properties containing approximately  sites for which revenue is classified as equity in income from unconsolidated joint ventures in the consolidated statements of operations 
total sites as of dec 
 community sites resort sites annual seasonal transient right to use joint ventures includes approximately  sites rented on an annual basis 
joint venture income is included in equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures 
a significant portion of the company s rental agreements on community sites are directly or indirectly tied to published cpi statistics that are issued during june through september each year 
the company currently expects its community base rental income to increase approximately as compared to the company has already notified over half of its community site customers of rent increases reflecting this revenue growth 

table of contents the company believes that the disruption in the site built housing market is contributing to the low new home sales volumes it is experiencing as potential customers are not able to sell their existing site built homes 
customers have also become more price sensitive  which is reflected in an increase in used home sale volumes 
in this environment  the company believes that customer demand for rentals  which do not require a down payment  is high 
the company is adapting to this by renting its vacant new homes 
this may represent an attractive source of occupancy if the company can convert renters to new homebuyers in the future 
the company is also focusing on smaller  more energy efficient and more affordable homes in its manufactured home properties 
the company s manufactured home rental operations have been increasing since for the year ended december   occupied manufactured home rentals increased to  or  from for the year ended december  net operating income increased to approximately million in from approximately million in the company believes that unlike the home sales business  at this time the company competes effectively with other types of rentals ie apartments 
the company is currently evaluating whether it wants to continue to invest in additional rental units 
in the company s resort properties  the company continues to work on extending customer stays 
the company has had success lengthening customer stays 
the company has introduced low cost membership products that focus on the installed base of almost eight million rv owners 
such products may include right to use contracts that entitle the customer to use certain properties the agreements 
the company is offering a zone park pass zpp  which can be purchased for one to four zones of the united states and requires annual payments of this replaces high cost products that were sold at properties after tours and lengthy sales presentations 
the company historically incurred significant costs to generate leads  conduct tours and make the sales presentations 
a single zone pass requires no upfront payment while passes for additional zones require modest upfront payments 
for the year ended december   the company sold approximately  zpp s 
the zpp s sales are contributing to a reduction in the net attrition of the customers who have right to use agreements 
existing customers may be offered an upgrade agreement from time to time 
the upgrade agreement is currently distinguishable from a new agreement that a customer would enter into by increased length of consecutive stay by ie up to days  ability to make earlier advance reservations  discounts on rental units and access to additional properties  which may include discounts at non membership rv properties 
each upgrade requires a nonrefundable upfront payment 
the company may finance the nonrefundable upfront payment under any agreement

certain purchase price adjustments may be made within one year following any acquisition 
real estate is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is computed on the straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the company generally uses a year estimated life for buildings acquired and structural and land improvements including site development  a ten year estimated life for building upgrades and a five year estimated life for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
new rental units are generally depreciated using a year estimated life from each model year down to a salvage value of of the original costs 
used rental units are generally depreciated based on the estimated life of the unit with no estimated salvage value 
the values of above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase in the case of below market leases or a decrease in the case of above market leases to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease 
the value associated with in place leases is amortized over the expected term  which includes an estimated probability of lease renewal 
expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred and significant renovations and improvements that improve the asset or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life 
the company periodically evaluates its long lived assets  including its investments in real estate  for impairment indicators 
the company s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance  market conditions and legal factors 
future events could occur which would cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 
for long lived assets to be held and used  including the company s investments in rental units  if an impairment indicator exists  the company compares the expected future undiscounted cash flows for the long lived asset against the carrying amount of that asset 
if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  the company would record an impairment loss for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amount of the asset 
for properties to be disposed of  an impairment loss is recognized when the fair value of the property  less the estimated cost to sell  is less than the carrying amount of the property measured at the time the company has a commitment to sell the property and or is actively marketing the property for sale 
a property to be disposed of is reported at the lower of its carrying amount or its estimated fair value  less costs to sell

customers may choose to upgrade their contracts to increase their usage and the number of properties they may access 
a contract may require the customer to make an upfront nonrefundable payment and annual payments during the term of the contract 
the stated term of a right to use contract is generally one to three years and the customer may renew his contract by continuing to make the annual payments 
the company will recognize the upfront non refundable payments over the estimated customer life which  based on historical attrition rates  the company has estimated to be from one to years 
for example  the company has currently estimated that of customers who enter a new right to use contract will terminate their contract after five years 
therefore  the upfront nonrefundable payments from of the contracts entered in any particular period are amortized on a straight line basis over a period of five years as five years is the estimated customer life for of the company s customers who enter a contract 
the historical attrition rates for upgrade contracts are lower than for new contracts  and therefore  the nonrefundable upfront payments for upgrade contracts are amortized at a different rate than for new contracts

per fasb asc  a non controlling interest is the portion of equity net assets in a subsidiary not attributable  directly or indirectly  to a parent

under fasb asc  such non controlling interests are reported on the consolidated balance sheets within equity  separately from the company s equity 
however  securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets at the option of the holder  not solely within the control of the issuer  must be classified outside of permanent equity 
this would result in certain outside ownership interests being included as redeemable non controlling interests outside of permanent equity in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company makes this determination based on terms in applicable agreements  specifically in relation to redemption provisions 
additionally  with respect to non controlling interests for which the company has a choice to settle the contract by delivery of its own shares  the company considered the guidance in the codification topic derivatives and hedging contracts in entity s own equity fasb asc to evaluate whether it controls the actions or events necessary to issue the maximum number of shares that could be required to be delivered under share settlement of the contract

inflation substantially all of the leases at the properties allow for monthly or annual rent increases which provide the company with the opportunity to achieve increases  where justified by the market  as each lease matures 
such types of leases generally minimize the risks of inflation to the company

the company s right to use contracts generally provide for an annual dues increase  but dues may be frozen under the terms of certain contracts if the customer is over years old 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo is a non gaap financial measure 
the company believes ffo  as defined by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  is generally an appropriate measure of performance for an equity reit 
while ffo is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance for equity reits  it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by gaap  and it should not be considered as an alternative to these indicators in evaluating liquidity or operating performance 
the company defines ffo as net income  computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or actual or estimated losses from sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
the company receives up front non refundable payments from the entry of right to use contracts 
in accordance with gaap  the upfront non refundable payments and related commissions are deferred and amortized over the estimated customer life 
although the nareit definition of ffo does not address the treatment of nonrefundable right to use payments  the company believes that it is appropriate to adjust for the impact of the deferral activity in its calculation of ffo 
the company believes that ffo is helpful to investors as one of several measures of the performance of an equity reit 
the company further believes that by excluding the effect of depreciation  amortization and gains or actual or estimated losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance  ffo can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity reits 
the company believes that the adjustment to ffo for the net revenue deferral of upfront non refundable payments and expense deferral of right to use contract commissions also facilitates the comparison to other equity reits 
investors should review ffo  along with gaap net income and cash flow from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities  when evaluating an equity reit s operating performance 
the company computes ffo in accordance with its interpretation of standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than the company does 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap  nor does it represent cash available to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  determined in accordance with 
table of contents gaap  as an indication of the company s financial performance  or to cash flow from operating activities  determined in accordance with gaap  as a measure of its liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including its ability to make cash distributions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the company s earnings  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent on prevailing market interest rates 
the primary market risk the company faces is long term indebtedness  which bears interest at fixed and variable rates
