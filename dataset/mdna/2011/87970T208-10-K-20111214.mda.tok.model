item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction telular develops products and services that utilize wireless networks to provide data connectivity among people and machines 
telular s software as a service saas offerings are created through telular s competence in developing complex software systems and cellular electronics that utilize the data transport capabilities of today s commercial wireless networks 
to enable these services  telular is a significant reseller of such commercial wireless services 
telular generates a majority of its revenue through the delivery of mm and event monitoring services  such as its telguard and tanklink services 
a portion of its revenue comes from the sale of specialty cellular hardware products designed by telular for use exclusively with its mm services 
telular operating expense levels are based in large part on its expectations for its future revenues 
if anticipated sales in any quarter do not occur as expected  expenditure and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and telular operating results for that quarter  and potentially for future quarters  could be adversely affected 
certain factors that could significantly impact expected results are described in forward looking information and in item a  risk factors 
the market for telular s products is primarily in north and south america and consists of a number of vertical applications including telguard security alarm conveyance  tanklink storage tank monitoring  and  general purpose wireless terminals for voice calls and internet access 
these markets are addressed primarily through indirect channels consisting of third party value added resellers vars  distributors  representatives and agents along with in house sales and customer support teams 
a direct sales model is utilized for certain large customers 
telular believes that its future success depends on its ability to continue to meet customers needs through product innovation  including the creation of event monitoring services that can be sold with products 
research and development activities sponsored by telular for the years ended september   and were   and  respectively 
telular anticipates research and development activities to continue at approximately the same levels as in the past 
the following details areas of product delivery and research during fiscal and anticipated in fiscal telguard telular s engineering team continues to update the telguard product and service portfolio by addressing the growing demand for interactive capability in the security market 
in fiscal  telular launched new features  such as telguard interactive services which let end users remotely arm and disarm their security systems 
in addition  we launched telguard voice  which allowed security dealers to speak with their end user customers in the event that an alarm condition was triggered 
perhaps the most significant development activity was the conversion of a majority of our hardware product lines to g capability 
while g capability launched in early fiscal  most of the development was accomplished in fiscal product innovation within this space is important for the long term success of telguard and we expect to continue to enhance our telguard software platform and underlying hardware products going forward 
tanklink the fiscal acquisition of tanklink corp 
formerly known as supplynet communications  inc brought telular a successful wireless communicator product line for tank level monitoring 
in early fiscal  the acquisition of tanklink end user accounts from our key value added reseller  smartlogix  inc  gave telular more direct control over the tanklink end users as well as improved profitability 
enhancements to the tanklink software platform  tankdata online  have been made during telular plans to further enhance both the software platform and the hardware product during fiscal to support a wider array of applications 
other mm solutions during  telular evaluated a number of vertical and sub vertical mm markets to determine the viability of creating or acquiring a product and or service in these markets 
while telular did not move forward with any such solutions  it will continue to examine growth possibilities and new solutions in the mm market space 
subsequent to september   telular has entered into a tentative agreement to purchase a company providing mm solutions 
for further discussion  see note subsequent events  in part ii  item of this form k 
fabrication of telular s products is accomplished through contract manufacturing 
contract manufacturers in china and the united states make and test all hardware products 
there are several firms that compete with telular s telguard products and services 
these primary competitors include honeywell  dsc  numerex and alarm 
com 
based on its own internal estimates  telular believes it has a market share of all currently active cellular alarm communicators in the united states  having introduced the first such device for digital cellular networks in march demand for cellular communicators has once again increased markedly over the past year 
we believe this is due to consumers eliminating traditional telephone lines and therefore  requiring a cellular communicator to enable a home security system 
if this trend continues  telular believes that telular and its competitors will continue to see substantial demand for products and related services 
there are numerous  small competitors to telular s tanklink offering 
the most significant of these is centeron  a division of robertshaw industries  which in turn is a subsidiary of invensys  inc more often  the tanklink offering competes against the pre existing  manual methods utilized by tank owners to determine the fill level and reorder timing for products held within tank vessels 
telular believes the key to growing its tanklink revenue is lowering its prices to the greatest extent possible in order to cost justify implementation of the tanklink solution 
with regard to the fcts sold by telular  there are a large number of competitors that manufacture and sell fcts 
they include ericsson  axesstel  yx and numerous other manufacturers in asia and elsewhere 
much of the demand for these terminals is outside the united states and demand is concentrated among the large wireless carriers that operate in various countries around the world 
the fct business is not a focus of telular for fiscal telular has granted a license for its patents to ericsson radio systems ab and currently faces competition for fct sales from ericsson 
with respect to its interface technology  telular currently has issued and active us patents and u 
s patents pending 
telular has successfully defended some of its patents in court 
outlook the statements contained in this outlook are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking  and actual results may differ materially 
telular expects to expend most of its market and product development resources on the mm space  including continuing to capitalize on its favorable market position in the domestic security alarm market by virtue of its well regarded telguard offering  as well as continuing to improve overall penetration in the tank level monitoring market through tanklink 
due to uncertainties in international markets and pending new product introductions  telular is unable to forecast results and resource allocations for fct products 
further  to the extent any components of fct products are declared end of life from their manufacturer  telular would assess overall demand for its product and either redesign the product to accommodate a replacement component part or potentially discontinue the manufacture of that particular product after offering customers a final chance to purchase them 
unit sales during fiscal  telular sold approximately  telguard units  compared with approximately  telguard units for fiscal we sold approximately  tank monitoring units in fiscal  as compared to sales of  tank monitoring units in fiscal our telguard subscriber base decreased in fiscal to approximately  down from approximately  subscribers in fiscal this decrease was a result of lower demand as a result of a change in pricing terms within agreements between adt  our largest security dealer customer  and its network of authorized dealers 
adt implemented a monthly service charge to the end user for any system sold by an authorized dealer that included a telguard product 
due to this surcharge  the authorized dealers generally opted to choose other security products over telguard products  which resulted in decreased sales volume 
telular expects this trend to continue and has implemented targeted pricing discount programs and will develop new customer relationships to maintain sales volumes 
the telguard advantage program tap was implemented to offer security dealers the opportunity to achieve preferred pricing for telguard products 
we expect total product sales of between  and  units on a quarterly basis throughout fiscal revenue trends total product sales decreased slightly year over year while service revenues have grown consistently 
this decrease was a result of lower demand as a result of a change in pricing terms within agreements between adt and its authorized dealers as mentioned above 
service subscribers decreased  from approximately  subscribers at the end of fiscal to approximately  subscribers at the end of fiscal  as a result of deactivations due to an ongoing account reconciliation project by a major customer 
even though the number of subscribers decreased  service revenues increased as we successfully added new subscribers at a higher average revenue per unit arpu 
service revenue was of sales in both the fourth quarter and year to date 
telguard service arpu  was for fiscal  as compared to for fiscal the increase in arpu was due to the combination of adding new subscribers during the year while eliminating lower arpu customers as a result of the account reconciliation project of a major customer 
tanklink service arpu was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the increase in arpu is a result of the purchase of the higher arpu customer base from smartlogix early in the second quarter of fiscal tanklink is now dealing directly with end user customers 
recent developments on january   telular acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities underlying the smartank line of business of smartlogix  inc smartlogix  telular s largest value added reseller of tanklink tank monitoring solutions 
telular also entered into a sales and service agreement service agreement with smartlogix 
under the service agreement  telular appointed smartlogix as an exclusive sales representative for the purpose of selling tank monitoring equipment to customers in the fuels and lubricants market 
pursuant to the terms in the service agreement  telular will pay smartlogix a commission on gross product revenue  as well as a commission on service revenue earned on the monitoring units sold  typically calculated as months of related service revenue 
the initial term of the service agreement is two years and may be renewed for an additional year 
on november   telular announced an increase in its regular quarterly dividend from 
to 
per share on its common stock 
the dividend will be payable on november  to shareholders of record as of the close of business on november  on december   telular entered into a merger agreement the agreement to purchase of the capital stock of skybitz  inc skybitz 
skybitz provides mobile resource management solutions focusing on over the road tracking via satellite 
skybitz s satellite based technology provides real time visibility of many asset types  including truck trailer  intermodal containers  sea going containers  rail cars  power generators and rental equipment 
the purchase will be accounted for using the purchase method 
under the terms of the agreement  telular will pay consideration of  comprised of  in cash and  of telular s common stock 
the cash portion of the consideration is anticipated to be funded with a  five year term loan from silicon valley bank svb and  from telular s cash on hand 
the acquisition is subject to the approval of a communications license transfer by the federal communications commission fcc and is expected to close in days

results of operations in thousands  except share data fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues and costs of sales change amount percentage net product sales monitoring equipment terminal total product revenues service revenues total revenues cost of sales products services gross margin revenues product revenues decreased primarily due to decreased sales in telguard monitoring equipment and terminal products  partially offset by an increase in tanklink product revenues 
revenues from sales of our telguard monitoring equipment decreased primarily due to lower demand as a result of a change in pricing terms within agreements between adt  our largest security dealer customer and its network of authorized dealers 
during the second half of fiscal  the dealer implemented a monthly service charge to the end user for any system sold by an authorized dealer that included a telguard product 
due to this surcharge  the authorized dealers generally opted to choose other security products over telguard products which resulted in decreased sales volume  approximately  telguard units were sold in fiscal compared with approximately  for fiscal telular has implemented targeted pricing discount programs and will develop new customer relationships to maintain sales volumes 
the telguard advantage program tap was implemented to offer security dealers the opportunity to achieve preferred pricing telguard products 
telguard s average selling price remained consistent year over year 
the decrease in terminal product revenues reflects continued depressed demand in both the us and in the central american latin american cala regions 
of the  of total terminal sales in fiscal  only were from international sales compared to  of total terminal sales in fiscal  of which were from international sales 
tanklink product revenues increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase is primarily due to the purchase of the smartank business unit from smartlogix on january  tanklink is now dealing directly with the end user customers  resulting in higher revenues 
as a result of dealing directly with the end user customers  tanklink s average unit selling price increased 
approximately  tanklink units were sold in fiscal compared to approximately  units in fiscal service revenues increased as a result of increases in the arpu for new telguard and tanklink customers and increased activations for tanklink in fiscal telguard experienced a net decrease in subscribers  declining from approximately  subscribers at the end of fiscal to approximately  subscribers at the end of fiscal this decrease was a result of subscribers being deactivated due to an ongoing account reconciliation project by a major customer 
telguard s arpu for fiscal was  a increase over fiscal s annual arpu of 
tanklink s arpu rose to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase is primarily due to the purchase of the smartank business unit and being able to bill those customers directly 
cost of sales the decrease in product cost of sales of is primarily due to reduced production costs primarily from re engineering of component parts 
telular cannot be certain that it will continue to be able to reduce production costs in the future 
service cost of sales decreased due to a reduction in the cost of providing monitoring services 
telular has successfully migrated its customer base to a new carrier that has reduced rates based on volume 
product margins  as a percentage of product revenues  increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase is a result of reduced cost of sales and increases in the tanklink product average selling price 
service margins  as a percentage of service revenues  increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year this increase was primarily due to reductions in fulfillment costs and higher arpu s 
operating expenses change of revenues amount percentage engineering and development selling and marketing general and administrative engineering and development engineering and development expenses remained relatively consistent between fiscal years 
the increase of was primarily due to in prototype materials and testing services  and  in facility costs primarily due to increased depreciation as a result of increased purchases of capital assets 
offsetting these increases was a decrease in payroll expenses resulting from in decreases in salaries and benefits as a result of reduced headcount  partially offset by a increase in bonuses as a result of a one time bonus paid to holders of stock options in conjunction with the payment of telular s special dividend  and  a decrease in consulting expenses as a result of reduced utilization of contract engineers 
telular expects to fill open positions in the fiscal selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses increased by  primarily due to in payroll related expenses as a result of increased sales and marketing personnel and expenses such as commissions that fluctuate with sales volume and a one time bonus paid to holders of stock options in conjunction with the payment of telular s special dividend  in advertising and tradeshows as telular increased its marketing efforts  in outside services and third party commissions primarily related to a service agreement with smartlogix in which telular appointed smartlogix as an exclusive sales representative for the purpose of selling tank monitoring equipment and services to customers in the fuels and lubricants market 
telular purchased the smartank business unit from smartlogix on january   and  in travel expenses incurred in conjunction with increased marketing sales efforts 
general and administrative g a g a expenses increased by primarily due to the following increases in payroll related expenses primarily as a result of a one time bonus paid to holders of stock options in conjunction with the payment of telular s special dividend  in amortization expense related to the intangibles recorded as a result of the purchase of the smartank business  in franchise tax fees related to the state of delaware  and  in investor relations expenses  including increased travel and increased nasdaq fees 
offsetting these increases was a decrease in professional fees of  primarily due to reduced legal fees 
other income other income decreased by primarily due to a decrease in interest income 
in fiscal telular was receiving interest on the outstanding trade receivable from smartlogix 
this trade receivable  approximately  was forgiven as part of the consideration for the purchase of the smartank business unit on january  from smartlogix 
income taxes telular recorded a current income tax provision of and a deferred income tax provision of  for fiscal year as compared with a current provision of and a deferred income tax benefit of  for fiscal year the increase in the current provision was primarily due to the increase in federal and state taxable income in fiscal year the deferred tax benefit was due to the reversal of the valuation allowances on net deferred tax assets  primarily telular s net operating loss carryforwards 
net income telular recorded net income of  or per fully diluted share for fiscal compared to net income of  or per fully diluted share for fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to the income tax benefit recorded from the reversal of net deferred tax asset valuation allowances in fiscal fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues and costs of sales change amount percentage net product sales monitoring equipment terminal total product revenues service revenues total revenues cost of sales products services gross margin revenues product revenues decreased primarily due to decreased sales in both telguard monitoring equipment and terminal products 
revenues from sales of our telguard monitoring equipment experienced lower demand as a result of a change in pricing terms within agreements between adt and its network of authorized dealers 
adt implemented a monthly service charge to the end user for any system sold by an authorized dealer that included a telguard product 
due to this surcharge  the authorized dealers generally opted to choose other security products over telguard products which resulted in decreased sales volume  approximately  telguard units were sold in fiscal compared with approximately  for fiscal telular expects this trend to continue and has implemented targeted pricing discount programs to maintain sales volumes 
the decrease in terminal product revenues reflects continued depressed demand in both the us and in the central american latin american cala regions 
of the  of total terminal sales in fiscal  only were from international sales compared to  of total terminal sales in fiscal  of which were from international sales 
telular has chosen to focus its sales efforts in the monitoring equipment and services market 
service revenues increased primarily due to increased activations in fiscal for each hardware unit sold  service revenue is generated when the unit is activated 
arpu increased slightly to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal as of september  the subscriber base was approximately  an increase of approximately  subscribers from approximately  subscribers as of september  cost of sales the decrease in product cost of sales of reflects lower sales offset by reduced production costs primarily from re engineering of component parts 
service cost of sales increased over last year reflecting the increase of subscribers during the year offset by reduced internal cost of billing the service 
product margins  as a percentage of product revenues  decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease is a result of pricing discount programs  such as the telguard advantage program  offered during the year targeted to encourage increased sales volumes 
telular expects to continue these pricing discount programs 
service margins  as a percentage of service revenues  increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year this increase was primarily due to a reduction in fulfillment costs 
operating expenses change of revenues amount percentage engineering and development selling and marketing general and administrative engineering and development engineering and development expenses decreased by primarily due to reductions of in consulting fees as a result of reduced utilization of contract engineers  and  in various office expenses and engineering testing expenses as a result of telular s overall initiative to reduce costs 
offsetting these reductions was increase in salary related expenses resulting from adding additional headcount in concert with the reduction of the utilization of contract engineers 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses decreased by primarily due to decrease in payroll related expenses as a result of decreased sales and marketing personnel and expenses such as commissions that fluctuate with sales volume  decrease in travel expenses related to reduced travel abroad  decrease in third party commission expenses related to decreased sales volume  and  decrease in various office and general expenses as a result of telular s overall initiative to reduce costs 
offsetting these decreases was an increase of approximately related to marketing efforts such as trade shows and brochures 
general and administrative g a g a expenses increased by primarily due to the following increases in legal expenses related primarily to increased efforts by outside counsel in defending telular in a patent lawsuit  in director non cash compensation as a result of valuing and recording the expense of the option component of restricted stock units  in business license fees and non income taxes as a result of increased presence in certain states  in bank and credit card fees as a result of increased usage by customers of credit cards to pay for products and services  and  in payroll related expenses primarily due to increase in non cash compensation related to stock options 
offsetting these increases were decreases to the following expenses in additional proxy costs related to a proxy contest in fiscal in fiscal there we no such additional costs in facility related costs such as phone  utilities and general maintenance  and  in travel and general office expenses as a result of telular s overall initiative to reduce costs 
other income other income increased by primarily due to increase in interest income  year over year  and decrease in various miscellaneous expenses 
income taxes telular recorded a current income tax provision of and a deferred income tax benefit of  for fiscal year as compared with a current provision of and no deferred tax provision for fiscal year the increase in the current provision was primarily due to the increase in taxable income in fiscal year the increase in the deferred tax benefit was due to the reversal of the valuation allowances on net deferred tax assets 
in the prior year  telular s net deferred tax assets had a full valuation allowance against them 
net income telular recorded net income of  or per fully diluted share for fiscal year compared to net income of  or per fully diluted share for fiscal year this increase was primarily due to the income tax benefit recorded from reversal of net deferred tax assets valuation allowances 
in fiscal  telular s net deferred tax assets had a full valuation allowance against them 
liquidity and capital resources management regularly reviews telular s working capital and available borrowings in addition to its cash and cash equivalent balance to determine if it has enough cash to operate the business 
on september   telular had cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of  compared to cash and cash equivalents of  and net working capital of  a year earlier 
effective on january   telular executed an amended and restated loan and security agreement with svb the amended loan agreement 
under the amended loan agreement  the term was extended for a new two year period  and total maximum borrowings remain at million 
though many of the terms and conditions were unchanged  including the maximum interest rates  some key differences include the ability for telular to borrow up to million under a revolving line of credit  with the ability to convert up to million of borrowings under the revolver into a three year term loan 
additionally  the amount available under the facility is no longer limited by the amount of eligible accounts receivable 
instead  there are certain financial covenants that telular must comply with in order to borrow 
an commitment fee was paid by telular and is being amortized over the new term of the loan 
management expects trade accounts receivable and inventory to turn into cash in short periods of time 
as such  given the level of cash and cash equivalents  trade accounts receivable and inventory  management believes telular has adequate resources to fund current and planned operations in a manner consistent with historical practices 
the tables below discuss the liquidity components of continuing operations for fiscal years and fiscal the company generated cash of  from continuing operations during fiscal compared to cash generated of  during the same period of fiscal the components of the change for fiscal are as follows income from continuing operations  cash provided 
the decrease in trade accounts receivable is due to the timely collection of outstanding balances  resulting from a more favorable product mix 
service revenue represents of telular total revenues for the twelve month period ending september  the accounts receivable associated with this revenue stream are generally collected within days of invoicing 
the timely collections along with reduced product billings resulted in the decrease 
the decrease in inventory reflects the company overall inventory strategy  sell from existing stock while adjusting production levels to augment the changes in sales levels 
trade accounts payable primarily consists of amounts due to telular contract manufacturers and monitoring service providers 
the decrease was primarily due to the timing of receipt of invoices from these vendors and their payment 
in the prior year  fiscal  payment was made before year end to these vendors 
the increase in accrued liabilities was primarily due to  increase in the estimated earn out related to the purchase of the smartank line of business  increase in deferred revenue due to increased advanced tank monitoring services related to smartank customers  decrease in legal fees related to a patent infringement lawsuit  and  decrease in various miscellaneous accrued expenses 
non cash expenses benefits  from the increase in deferred tax provision related to decrease in net deferred tax assets   from stock based compensation   from depreciation expense  of amortization expense  and  from the loss on disposal of operating assets 
net cash used by other working capital items  primarily the acquisition of intangibles  patents  trademarks  a licensing fee and the increase in income taxes payable 
total cash provided by continuing operations fiscal the company generated cash of  from continuing operations during fiscal compared to cash generated of  during the same period of fiscal the components of the change for fiscal are as follows income from continuing operations  cash provided

the timely collections along with reduced product billings resulted in the decrease 
the decrease in inventory reflects the company overall inventory strategy  sell from existing stock while reducing production levels to augment the reduction in sales levels 
trade accounts payable primarily consists of amounts due to telular contract manufacturers and monitoring service providers 
the increase was primarily due to the timing of receipt of invoices from these vendors 
in the prior year payment was made before year end  in fiscal  payments to these vendors were made subsequent to year end 
the increase in accrued liabilities was primarily due toa increase in legal fees related to a patent infringement lawsuit  a increase in royalties due which are beingpaid twice a year and approximately in decreases in various miscellaneous accrued expenses 
non cash expenses benefits  from the reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance   from stock based compensation expense  of depreciation expense  of amortization expense  and  from the loss on disposal of operating assets 
net cash used by other working capital items  primarily the acquisition of intangibles  patents  trademarks  a licensing fee and the increase in income taxes payable 
total cash provided by continuing operations capital expenditures for fiscal years and were  and  respectively 
the expenditures were for improvements to internal network equipment  production equipment  such as test stations for new products  and product certification costs for new products 
the expenditures were for improvements to the message center  test equipment for operations  product certification and leasehold improvements for the atlanta office 
telular anticipates funding future capital additions with cash from operations 
on july   telular s board approved a plan to repurchase up to  of telular s common stock on the open market 
during fiscal  there were no shares repurchased under the plan 
during fiscal   shares were repurchased at a cost of cumulatively through september   telular has repurchased  shares at a cost of  telular generally requires its foreign customers to prepay  obtain letters of credit or qualify for credit 
also  to mitigate the effects of currency fluctuations on telular s results of operations  telular conducts all of its international transactions in us dollars 
the following table sets forth our total contractual obligations as of september  payments due by period less than contractual cash obligations total year years years after years operating leases purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations purchase commitments are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements  consisting primarily of raw materials and finished goods inventory 
telular expects to satisfy these commitments primarily from cash from the revenues generated by the delivery of backlogged orders 
critical accounting policies management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses telular consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to the net realizable value of inventories and intangible assets 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the presentation of telular s financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition telular s revenue is primarily generated from three sources the sale of hardware units  under non recurring agreements  the provision of monitoring services  under recurring agreements  and  the provision of ancillary services such as installation and non warranty repairs and royalty revenue 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the hardware unit or the service has been delivered  fees and prices are fixed and determinable and collectability is probable when all other significant obligations have been fulfilled 
telular recognizes revenue and associated costs from hardware unit sales at the time of shipment of products which is when title transfers 
hardware unit discounts are recorded as a reduction in revenue in the same period that the revenue is recognized 
telular offers customers the right to return hardware units that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery  see warranty section below 
telular continuously monitors and tracks such hardware unit returns and records a provision for the estimated amount of such future returns  based on historical experience 
while such returns have historically been within expectations  telular cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same return rates that it has experienced in the past 
any significant increase in hardware unit failure rates and the resulting credit returns could have a material adverse impact on operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize 
monitoring service revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided 
payments received in advance of providing monitoring services are deferred and recognized over the period in which the service is delivered 
costs associated with providing the monitoring service are recorded when the service is provided 
for those arrangements that include multiple deliverables  telular follows the guidance in accounting standard codification asc subtopic  as amended by accounting standards update asu asc subtopic established criteria for determining if a revenue arrangement has multiple deliverables 
asu amended the multiple element revenue guidance to modify the separation criteria by eliminating the criterion that requires objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered item  and eliminate the use of the residual method of allocation and instead required that arrangement consideration be allocated  at the inception of the arrangement  to all deliverables based on their relative selling price 
certain multiple element revenue arrangements include both product and monitoring services 
telular has determined that the revenue from multiple deliverable arrangements has met the criteria for treating each revenue source as a separate element 
consideration is allocated to the deliverables at inception of an arrangement using the relative selling price method  based on telular s best estimate of selling price 
key factors that are considered when establishing a selling price are the industry segment to which the products and services are sold  estimated selling price of our competitors  where available  and an internally established gross margin range 
product revenue is billed and recognized upon shipment to the customer while monitoring services revenue is billed periodically  usually monthly  and recognized when the service is provided 
telular recognizes ancillary service revenues when the service is delivered 
costs associated with these services are recorded in the period the service is delivered 
royalty revenue  which is based on a percentage of sales by the licensee  is estimated by telular  based upon historical data provided by the licensee  in the period in which management estimated the sales have taken place 
telular periodically reconciles these estimates to the actual payments received from the licensee  adjusting revenue accordingly 
historically  telular s estimates have not been materially different than the payments received from the licensee 
allowance for doubtful accounts telular maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make payment for products and services 
telular evaluates the collectability of customer receivables by considering the payment history and the financial stability of its customers 
if telular believes that an account receivable may not be collected  a charge is recorded to the allowance account 
at september  and  the allowance for doubtful accounts related to trades accounts receivable from continuing operations was and  respectively 
reserve for inventory obsolescence significant management judgment is required to determine the reserve for obsolete or excess inventory 
telular generally considers inventory quantities greater than a one year supply  based on current year activity  to be excess  unless that inventory has alternative uses 
telular also provides for the total value of inventories that are determined to be obsolete based on criteria such as customer demand and changing technologies 
at september  and  the inventory reserves were and  respectively 
changes in strategic direction  such as discontinuance or expansion of product lines  changes in technology or changes in market conditions  could result in significant changes in required reserves 
reserve for warranty telular maintains a reserve for products that are returned within telular s warranty period due to inoperability 
telular has different warranty periods for its different product groups the security monitoring products has a month warranty period  the tank monitoring products have a month warranty period  and  the terminal products have a month warranty period 
significant management judgment is required to determine the warranty reserve 
telular utilizes historical information regarding units returned within the appropriate warranty period and the costs incurred to repair returned units 
telular then estimates required warranty reserves for future products that may be returned 
as of september  and  the warranty reserve was and  respectively 
goodwill telular evaluates the fair value and recoverability of goodwill at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
in determining fair value and recoverability  telular makes projections regarding future cash flows 
these projections are based on assumptions and estimates of growth rates for net revenues  cost of sales and operating expenses for the monitoring and terminal businesses  anticipated future economic conditions  the assignment of discount rates relative to risk associated with companies in similar industries  and  estimates of terminal values 
an impairment loss is assessed and recognized in operating earnings when the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount 
as of september  and  goodwill was not impaired 
income taxes in determining income for financial statement purposes  telular must make certain estimates and judgments 
these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
in evaluating the ability to recover its deferred tax assets  telular considers all available positive and negative evidence including its past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses and its forecast of future taxable income 
in estimating future taxable income  telular developed assumptions including the amount of future federal and state pre tax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates telular is using to manage the underlying business 
telular has recorded significant valuation allowances that are intended to be maintained until it is more likely than not the deferred tax asset will be realized 
the current valuation allowance of  is for state net operating losses that will expire before they can be realized 
the realization of the remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate state jurisdiction 
significant factors that could negatively impact telular s determination of the recognition of the net deferred tax assets would be changes in the ownership of telular and changes in tax laws and rates 
based on internal revenue code section section  changes in the ownership of telular may limit the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
any section limitation may require that telular record an additional valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets 
management is not aware  at this time  of any such ownership changes that would have a negative impact on the recognition of the net deferred tax assets 
any reduction in future taxable income may require that telular record an additional valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a material impact on telular s future earnings 
changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
the state of illinois increased its corporate income tax rate from to in january the state also suspended the use of net operating losses to offset current taxable income for three years 
telular implemented a tax strategy that would lower taxable income apportioned to illinois  thereby lowering the current state tax payable 
this strategy reduced telular s estimated use of future net operating losses in illinois  resulting in the increase in the valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets which increased telular s deferred tax provision 
during fiscal  telular reversed million of valuation allowance after a comprehensive assessment of deferred tax asset realizability that was triggered by the achievement of three years of cumulative book income 
the primary rationale for the reversal of the valuation allowance and thus  the realization of deferred tax assets  is the assumption that telular will generate sufficient future taxable income 
this conclusion is based on forecasted taxable income over the period that existing net operating losses are scheduled to expire 
reasons that there is now sufficient forecasted taxable income include the exit from the fcp market in fiscal which had been generating significant operating losses and telular s continued focus in recent years towards growing its higher margin recurring service 
with these key strategic changes  telular s current operating model provided the basis upon which it was reasonable to assume that taxable income would continue 
telular s taxable income forecast that was used as the basis for this determination used a conservative estimate for taxable income growth from through  and no growth thereafter 
further  it did not incorporate any new business lines or depend upon any material transaction such as an acquisition or any other unusual or non routine event to achieve the results necessary in order to realize the estimated taxable income 
under the uncertain tax position provisions of asc  income taxes  telular would recognize liabilities for tax issues in the u 
s based on telular s estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
these tax liabilities would be recorded in income taxes in the consolidated balance sheets 
as of september   telular has no uncertain tax positions recorded in its financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements the discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements is hereby incorporated by reference from item  notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk telular frequently invests available cash and cash equivalents in short term instruments such as certificates of deposit  commercial paper and money market accounts 
although the rate of interest paid on such investments may fluctuate over time  each of telular s investments is made at a fixed interest rate over the duration of the investment 
all of these investments have maturities of less than days 
telular believes its exposure to market risk fluctuations for these investments is not material as of september  financial instruments that potentially subject telular to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade accounts receivable  particularly from international customers 
to reduce its exposure to the credit risks of international customers  telular generally seeks payment prior to shipment or receives irrevocable letters of credit that are confirmed by us banks 
in some instances when telular extends credit to foreign customers without the protection of prepayment or letters of credit  telular performs ongoing credit evaluations and charges amounts to operations when they are determined to be uncollectible 
to mitigate the effects of currency fluctuations on telular s results of operations  telular conducts all of its international transactions in us dollars
