the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto  included elsewhere herein 
level communications  inc  through its operating subsidiaries  is primarily engaged in the communications business  with additional operations in coal mining 
communications business the company is a facilities based provider of a broad range of communications services 
revenue for communications services is recognized on a monthly basis as these services are provided 
for contracts involving private line  wavelengths and dark fiber services  level may receive up front payments for services to be delivered for a period of generally up to years 
in these situations  level defers the revenue and amortizes it on a straight line basis to earnings over the term of the contract 
at december   for contracts where up front payments were received for services to be delivered in the future  the company weighted average remaining contract period was approximately years 

table of contents communications revenue consists of core network services includes revenue from transport  infrastructure  data and local and enterprise voice services 
wholesale voice services includes revenue from long distance voice services  including domestic voice termination  international voice termination and toll free services 
other communications services includes revenue from managed modem and its related reciprocal compensation services and sbc contract services  which includes revenue from the sbc master services agreement  which was obtained in the december acquisition of wiltel communications group  llc 
these categories of communications revenue are in different phases of the service life cycle requiring different levels of investment and focus and providing different contributions to the company communications adjusted ebitda 
management of level believes that growth in revenue from its core network services is critical to the long term success of its communications business 
core network services the company transport services include metropolitan and intercity wavelengths  private line  ethernet private line  professional services and transoceanic services 
the company infrastructure services include dark fiber and colocation services 
growth in transport and infrastructure revenue is largely dependent on increased demand for bandwidth services and available capital of companies requiring communications capacity for their own use or in providing capacity as a service provider to their customers 
customer expenditures for these services may be in the form of monthly payments or up front payments for private line  wavelength or dark fiber services 
the company is focused on providing end to end transport services to its customers to directly connect customer locations with a private network 
pricing for end to end metropolitan transport services have been relatively stable 
for intercity transport services  the company continues to experience pricing pressure for point to point locations  particularly in locations where a large number of carriers co locate their facilities 
an increase in demand may be partially offset by declines in unit pricing 
data services primarily include the company high speed internet protocol service  dedicated internet access dia service  atm and frame relay services  ip and ethernet virtual private network vpn services  content delivery network cdn services  and vyvx broadcast services 
level s internet access service is a high quality and high speed service offered in a variety of capacities 
the company vpn services permit businesses of any size to replace multiple networks with a single  cost effective solution that greatly simplifies the converged transmission of voice  video  and data 
this convergence to a single platform can be obtained without sacrificing the quality of service or security levels of traditional atm and frame relay offerings 
vpn services also permit customers to prioritize network application traffic so that high priority applications  such as voice and video  are not compromised in performance by the flow of low priority applications such as email 
revenue growth from customers that are seeking to distribute their feature rich content or video over the internet is dependent on the continued increase in demand from consumers  the pricing environment and the availability of capacity on the company network 
an increase in the reliability and security of information transmitted over the internet and declines in the cost to transmit data have resulted in increased utilization of e commerce or web based services by businesses 
the market for data and ip is generally characterized by price compression and high unit growth rates depending upon the type of service 
the company experienced price compression in the high speed ip market in and expects that pricing for its high speed ip services will continue to decline in 
table of contents the company  through its level vyvx service business  provides video transport services over the company fiber optic network and via satellite 
it carries live broadcast content from the original source such as sporting events  special events or other live studio produced programming  to production studios  broadcast master control centers and other destinations within the broadcasters delivery chain 
for live events where the location is not known in advance  such as breaking news stories in remote locations  the company provides an integrated satellite and fiber optic network based service to transmit the content to its customers 
for these services  most of level vyvx customers contract for the service on an event by event basis  however  there are some customers who have purchased a dedicated point to point service which enables these customers to transmit programming at any time 
in june  level completed the sale of its vyvx advertising distribution business to dg fastchannel  inc and received gross proceeds at closing of approximately million in cash 
level has retained ownership of vyvx core broadcast business  including the vyvx services broadcast business content distribution capabilities 
the financial results of the vyvx advertising distribution business are included in the company consolidated results of operations through the date of sale 
level recognized a gain on the sale of the vyvx advertising distribution business of million in the gain is presented in the consolidated statements of operations as gain on sale of business groups  net 
the company has developed content distribution services through the acquisition of the content delivery network services business cdn business of savvis in january  and the acquisition of dublin  ireland based servecast ltd 
in july the company believes that the addition of the cdn business with its strong  broad portfolio of patents has helped the company secure its commercial efforts in the heavily patented cdn market  in which a number of competitors have significant  patented intellectual property 
level believes that one of the largest sources of future incremental demand for communications services will be derived from customers that are seeking to distribute their feature rich content or video over the internet 
the company core network services include local and enterprise voice services 
local voice services are primarily components that enable other service providers to deliver business or consumer ready voice services to their end customers 
enterprise voice services are business grade voice services that the company sells directly to its business customers 
beginning in the first quarter of  level modified its revenue disclosure based on the manner in which certain customers are classified within customer facing groups 
level has discussed its core network services revenue in terms of wholesale  large enterprise and federal  mid market  and european customers 
the and amounts have also been presented for comparability purposes 
wholesale includes revenue from international and domestic carriers  cable companies  wireless companies  voice service providers and the vast majority of former content market group customers 
large enterprise and federal includes fortune and other large enterprises that purchase communications services in a manner similar to carriers  including financial services  healthcare and systems integrators  federal government agencies and academic consortia  plus certain large former content markets group customers 
mid market includes medium enterprises generally outside the fortune  regional service providers  certain academic institutions and some state and local governments 
european remains unchanged from the presentation 
the european revenue includes the largest european consumers of bandwidth  including the largest european and international 
table of contents carriers  large system integrators  voice service providers  cable operators  internet service providers  content providers  enterprises  and government and education sectors 
core network services revenue by customer group was as follows year ended december  dollars in millions wholesale large enterprise and federal mid market european total core network services the company believes that the alignment of core network services around customer groups allowed it to drive growth while enabling it to better focus on the needs of its customers 
each of these groups is supported by dedicated employees in sales 
each of these groups is also supported by non dedicated  centralized service or product management and development  corporate marketing  global network services  engineering  information technology  and corporate functions including legal  finance  strategy and human resources 
the classification of customers within each customer group can change based upon sales team assignments  merger and acquisition activity by customers and other factors 
wholesale voice services the company offers wholesale voice services that target large and existing markets 
the revenue potential for wholesale voice services is large  however  the pricing and margins are expected to continue to decline over time as a result of the new low cost ip and optical based technologies 
in addition  the market for wholesale voice services is being targeted by many competitors  several of which are larger and have more financial resources than the company 
other communications services the company other communications services are mature services that are not critical areas of emphasis for the company 
other communications services includes revenue from managed modem  its related reciprocal compensation services  and sbc contract services  which includes revenue derived under the sbc master services agreement that was obtained in the wiltel acquisition 
the company and its customers continue to see consumers migrate from narrow band dial up services to higher speed broadband services as the narrow band market matures 
the company expects ongoing declines in other communications services revenue similar to what has been experienced over the past several years 
the company receives compensation from other carriers when it terminates traffic originating on those carriers networks 
this reciprocal compensation is based on interconnection agreements with the respective carriers or rates mandated by the fcc 
the company has interconnection agreements in place for the majority of traffic subject to reciprocal compensation 
the majority of the company existing reciprocal compensation revenue is associated with agreements that are in evergreen status  meaning that the agreements remain in place and in effect until either terminated by mutual agreement or replaced by a successor agreement 
the company continues to negotiate new interconnection agreements or amendments to its existing interconnection agreements with local carriers as needed 
the company earns the majority of its reciprocal compensation revenue from providing managed modem services  which are declining 
the company also receives reciprocal compensation from its voice services 
in this case  reciprocal compensation is reported within core network services revenue 

table of contents communications business strategy and objectives the company management continues to review all existing lines of business and service offerings to determine how those lines of business and service offerings enhance the company focus on delivering communications services and meeting its financial objectives 
to the extent that certain lines of business  customer groups or service offerings are not considered to be compatible with the delivery of the company services or with meeting its financial objectives  level may exit those lines of business or stop offering those services 
the company is focusing its attention on the following operational and financial objectives growing core network services revenue by increasing sales  reducing customer churn  and continuous improvement in operational efficiency  focusing on the the delivery of a customer experience that is the best in the industry  continuing to localize certain decision making and interaction with its mid market enterprise customers  including leveraging its existing network assets  enabling its sales channels through effective marketing and sales support  effectively managing network costs and operating expenses  continuing to show improvements in adjusted ebitda  reducing its leverage ratio and refinancing its future debt maturities  and managing wholesale voice services revenue for margin contribution 
the company management believes the introduction of new services or technologies  as well as the further development of existing technologies  may reduce the cost or increase the supply of certain services similar to those already provided 
the ability of the company to anticipate  adapt and invest in these technology changes in a timely manner may affect the company future success 
level will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and could make additional acquisitions in the future 
the successful integration of any acquired businesses into level is important to the success of level the company must identify synergies and integrate acquired networks and support organizations  while maintaining the service quality levels expected by customers to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions 
successful integration of any acquired businesses will depend on the company ability to manage the operations  realize opportunities for revenue growth presented by strengthened service offerings and expanded geographic market coverage  and eliminate redundant and excess costs to fully realize the expected synergies 
if the company is not able to efficiently and effectively integrate any businesses or operations it acquires  the company may experience material negative consequences to its business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company has ongoing process and system development work that is being implemented as part of the continued efforts that have improved and are expected to further improve the full spectrum of the customer experience  including service activation  service management and customer billing as well as various operational efficiency improvements 
the company ongoing operating results and financial condition could be affected by certain trends or uncertainties 
for example  the continued worldwide economic downturn and prolonged uncertainty in the global financial markets have required the company to continue to manage its cost structure and operating expenses carefully and to concentrate its capital expenditures on those technologies and assets that enable the company to further develop its core network services and replace the decline in revenue and earnings from other communications services 
the company has 
table of contents also experienced shortages of certain types of equipment from its suppliers that may affect its ability to provision capacity on its network 
as a result  the company increased its inventory of certain equipment components to compensate for certain vendor delivery issues  which supported increased customer installations during the second half of the year 
in addition  the company has experienced increased intervals for the installation of capacity from providers of connections or capacity from the company network to a customer location or other carrier  which are referred to as off net connections 
the company ongoing operating results and financial condition could also be negatively affected  if as a result of economic conditions the company customers defer or forego purchases of the company services or fail to make timely payments to the company as a result of the customer inability to obtain adequate access to credit 
in addition to the operational objectives mentioned above  the company has also been focused on improving its liquidity  financial condition  and extending the maturity dates of certain debt

the company recognized a million loss on the extinguishment of these notes 
also in the first quarter of  the company repaid million aggregate principal amount of its convertible subordinated notes due that had matured 
in addition  in various transactions during the first quarter of  the company  or its subsidiaries  repurchased million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due  the remaining million of its senior notes due  and million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due the company recognized a loss on these repurchases of less than million 
the company will continue to look for opportunities to improve its financial position and focus its resources on growing revenue and managing costs for the communications business 

table of contents coal mining level  through its two consolidated owned joint venture surface mines  one each in montana and wyoming  sells coal primarily through long term contracts with public utilities 
the long term contracts for the delivery of coal establish the price  volume  and quality requirements of the coal to be delivered 
revenue under these and other contracts is generally recognized when coal is shipped to the customer 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  equity  revenue  expenses and related disclosures 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while the company has other accounting policies that involve estimates such as the allowance for doubtful accounts  accruals for estimated tax and legal liabilities  valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  and unfavorable contracts recognized in purchase accounting  management has identified the policies below  which require the most significant judgments and estimates to be made in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations 
revenue revenue for communications services  including transport  infrastructure  data  voice and managed modem  is recognized monthly as the services are provided 
communications services are provided either on a usage basis  which can vary period to period  or at a contractually committed amount 
reciprocal compensation revenue is recognized when an interconnection agreement is in place with another carrier  or if an agreement has expired  when the parties have agreed to continue operating under the previous agreement until a new agreement is negotiated and executed  or at rates mandated by the fcc 
periodically  the company will receive payment for reciprocal compensation services in excess of fcc rates and before an agreement is in place 
these amounts are included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets until a final agreement has been reached and the necessary regulatory approvals have been received at which time the reciprocal compensation revenue is recognized 
these amounts were insignificant to the company in  and revenue attributable to leases of dark fiber pursuant to indefeasible rights of use agreements irus that qualified for sales type lease accounting and were entered into prior to june   were recognized at the time of delivery and acceptance of the fiber by the customer 
certain sale and long term iru agreements of dark fiber and capacity entered into after june   are required to be accounted for in the same manner as sales of real estate with property improvements or integral equipment 
this accounting treatment results in the deferral of revenue for the cash that has been received and the recognition of revenue ratably over the term of the agreement generally up to years 
termination revenue is recognized when a customer disconnects service prior to the end of the contract period and for which level had previously received consideration and for which revenue 
table of contents recognition was deferred 
termination revenue is also recognized when customers make termination penalty payments to level to settle contractually committed purchase amounts that the customer no longer expects to meet or when a customer and level renegotiate a contract under which level is no longer obligated to provide product or services for consideration previously received and for which revenue recognition has been deferred 
termination revenue is reported in the same manner as the original product or service provided 
accounting practice and guidance with respect to the accounting treatment of revenue continues to evolve 
any changes in the accounting treatment could affect the manner in which the company accounts for revenue within its communications and coal businesses 
revenue reserves the company establishes appropriate revenue reserves at the time services are rendered based on an analysis of historical credit activity to address  where significant  situations in which collection is not reasonably assured as a result of credit risk  potential billing disputes or other reasons 
the company significant estimates are based on assumptions and other considerations  including payment history  credit ratings  customer financial performance  history of billing disputes  industry financial performance and aging analysis 
cost of revenue for communications services the company disputes incorrect billings from its suppliers of network services 
the most prevalent types of disputes include disputes for circuits that are not disconnected by the supplier on a timely basis and usage bills with incorrect or inadequate information 
depending on the type and complexity of the issues involved  it may and often does take several quarters to resolve the disputes 
the company establishes appropriate cost of revenue reserves for disputed supplier billings based on an analysis of its historical experience in resolving disputes with its suppliers 
in determining the amount of the cost of network service expenses and related accrued liabilities to reflect in its financial statements  the company considers the adequacy of documentation of disconnect notices  compliance with prevailing contractual requirements for submitting these disconnect notices  disputes to the provider of the network services  and compliance with its interconnection agreements with these carriers 
judgment is required in estimating the ultimate outcome of the dispute resolution process  as well as any other amounts that may be incurred to conclude the negotiations or settle any litigation 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material 
non cash compensation the company recognizes stock based compensation expense for all share based payment awards in accordance with fair value recognition provisions 
under the fair value recognition provisions  the company recognizes stock based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate  recognizing compensation cost for only those awards expected to vest over the requisite service period of the awards 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require subjective assumptions  including the assumption for stock price volatility 
the company estimates the stock price volatility using a combination of historical and implied volatility  as level believes it is consistent with the approach most marketplace participants would consider by using all available information to estimate expected volatility 
the company has determined that expected volatility is more reflective of market conditions and provides a more accurate indication of volatility than using solely historical volatility 
in reaching this conclusion  the company has considered many factors including the extent to which its future expectations of volatility over the respective term is likely to differ from historical measures  the absence of actively traded options for the company 
table of contents common stock and the company ability to review volatility of its publicly traded convertible debt with similar terms and prices to the options the company is valuing 
the company issues outperform stock options in which the value received is based on a formula involving a multiplier related to the level by which the company common stock outperforms the s p index 
the company utilizes a modified black scholes model due to the additional variables required to calculate the effect of the success multiplier for its outperform stock options  including estimating the expected volatility of the s p index 
as a result of the company stock price at the end of  the aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding outperform stock options was zero as of december  the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and the company uses different assumptions  stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  the company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if actual forfeiture rates are materially different from the company estimate  stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what the company has recorded in the current period 
valuation of long lived assets the company performs an assessment of its long lived assets  including finite lived acquisition related intangible assets  for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets or asset groupings may not be recoverable 
this review requires the identification of the lowest level of identifiable cash flows for purposes of grouping assets subject to review 
the estimate of undiscounted cash flows includes long term forecasts of revenue growth  gross margins and operating expenses 
all of these items require significant judgment and assumptions 
the impairment analysis of long lived assets also requires the company to make certain subjective assumptions and estimates regarding the expected future use of certain additional conduits and the expected future use of certain empty conduits 
an impairment loss may exist when the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets are less than their carrying amount 
if an asset is deemed to be impaired  the amount of the impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the long lived asset carrying value as compared to its estimated fair value  based on management assumptions and projections 
the company conducted a long lived asset impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of and concluded that its long lived assets  including its finite lived acquisition related intangible assets  were not impaired 
to the extent that future changes in assumptions and estimates cause a change in estimates of future cash flows that indicate the carrying amount of the company long lived assets  including finite lived acquisition related intangible assets  may not be recoverable  the company may incur impairment charges in the future to write down the carrying amount of the company long lived assets to their estimated fair value 
useful lives of long lived assets the company performs periodic internal reviews to evaluate the depreciable lives of its property  plant and equipment 
due to rapid changes in technology and the competitive environment  selecting the estimated economic life of telecommunications property  plant  and equipment requires a significant amount of judgment 
the company internal reviews take into account input from the company global network services personnel regarding actual usage  physical wear and tear  replacement history  and assumptions regarding the benefits and costs of implementing new technology that factor in the need to meet the company financial objectives 

table of contents valuation of goodwill and acquired indefinite lived intangible assets the company performs an annual impairment assessment of its goodwill at the end of the fourth quarter  or more frequently if the company determines that indicators of impairment exist 
the company impairment review process compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
the company reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in note segment information to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill assigned to the communications reportable segment totaled billion at both december  and there was no goodwill assigned to the coal mining reportable segment at december  or if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then a second step must be performed  and the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill must be determined and compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then an impairment loss equal to the difference will be recorded 
the company considers the use of multiple valuation techniques in accordance with the fair value measurements and disclosures guidance to estimate the fair value of its reporting units and has consistently applied a market approach as part of its impairment assessment process 
under the market approach  the company estimates the fair value using an in exchange valuation premise based upon the market capitalization of level using quoted market prices  adds an estimated control premium  and then assigns that fair market value to the reporting units 
the most significant estimates and assumptions utilized in its valuations with the market approach involved estimating an appropriate control premium and allocating the estimated enterprise fair value to each of its reporting units 
the company concluded that using as a control premium would be reasonable in its market approach valuation for purposes of performing its goodwill impairment test based on historical control premiums offered for comparable transactions in the communications industry  the availability of financing  and number of potential buyers 
the calculated market value using the company quoted market price valuation is allocated to each of its two reporting units based on their relative percentage of adjusted ebitda  as this is a key external and internal valuation metric 
the company conducted its goodwill impairment analysis at the end of and and concluded that its goodwill was not impaired in either period 
the company also performs an assessment of its acquisition related indefinite lived intangible assets annually at the end of the fourth quarter  or more frequently if the company determines that indicators of impairment exist 
the company impairment review process compares the fair value of the indefinite lived acquisition related intangible assets to their respective carrying values 
if the fair value of the indefinite lived acquisition related intangible assets exceeds their carrying values  then the indefinite lived acquisition related intangible assets are not impaired 
the company fair value methodology primarily consists of a discounted cash flow analysis that includes estimates of revenue  costs  growth rates and an appropriate discount rate and market comparable estimates 
these estimates are based on historical data  various internal estimates and management expectations of future trends 
the company conducted its indefinite lived acquisition related intangible asset impairment analyses at the end of and and concluded that there was no impairment in either period 
the company performs periodic internal reviews to evaluate whether events and circumstances continue to support indefinite useful lives on its intangible assets 
the company considers input from 
table of contents its legal  business development and product personnel in its evaluation of all relevant factors supporting the useful lives of its intangible assets 
to the extent that future changes in the company assumptions and estimates cause a change in the related fair value estimates that indicate the carrying amount of the company goodwill and indefinite lived acquisition related intangible assets may not be recoverable  the company may incur impairment charges in the future to write down the carrying amount of the company goodwill and indefinite lived acquisition related intangible assets to their estimated fair value 
derivative financial instruments the company uses derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate swaps  to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rate movements 
the company primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to decrease the volatility of its earnings and cash flows affected by changes in the underlying rates 
to achieve this objective  the company enters into financial derivatives  primarily interest rate swap agreements  the values of which change in the opposite direction of the anticipated future cash flows 
the company has floating rate long term debt see note long term debt of the consolidated financial statements 
these obligations expose the company to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates 
if interest rates increase  interest expense increases 
conversely  if interest rates decrease  interest expense decreases 
the company has designated its interest rate swap agreements as a cash flow hedge 
swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the company making fixed rate payments to a counterparty over the lives of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount 
the change in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged transaction affects earnings  due to the fact that the interest rate swap agreements qualify as effective cash flow hedges 
the company also has certain equity conversion rights associated with debt instruments  which are considered derivative instruments as of december  and certain of these derivative instruments were classified as a liability at december  and the company had liabilities associated with its embedded derivatives of less than million at december  and million at december  the company has recognized the gains or losses from changes in fair value of any derivatives that are not designated as hedges in other income expense in the statements of operations 
as a result of the changes in fair value related to these derivative instruments  the company recognized a gain of million in  a gain of million in and no gains or losses in the company does not use any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
the company is exposed to credit related losses in the event of non performance by counterparties 
the company considers credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both the company non performance risk and the respective counterparty non performance risk in its fair value measurements 
the counterparties to any of the financial derivatives the company enters into are major institutions with investment grade credit ratings 
the company evaluates counterparty credit risk before entering into any hedge transaction  and continues to closely monitor the financial market and the risk that it counterparties will default on their obligations 
this credit risk is generally limited to the unrealized gains  if any  in such contracts  should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted 
asset retirement obligations the company asset retirement obligations consist of legal requirements to remove certain of its network infrastructure at the expiration of the underlying right of way row term  restoration requirements for leased facilities and reclamation requirements in the coal mining business to 
table of contents remediate previously mined properties 
the initial and subsequent measurement of the company asset retirement obligations require the company to make significant estimates regarding the eventual costs and probability or likelihood that the company will be required to remove certain of its network infrastructure  restore certain of its leased properties and remediate certain of its previously mined properties 
in addition  the company must estimate the periods over which these costs will be incurred and the present value of such costs using the company estimate of its credit adjusted risk free interest rate upon initial recognition 
the company periodically evaluates its asset retirement obligations to determine if the amount and timing of its cash flow estimates continue to be appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
the asset retirement obligations for certain leased facilities and coal mining locations were increased by an insignificant amount in and due to revised estimates of future obligations 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued a new accounting standard that provides revenue recognition guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables 
specifically  the new standard requires an entity to allocate consideration at the inception of an arrangement to all of its deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
in the absence of the vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of the selling prices  consideration must be allocated to the deliverables based on management best estimate of the selling prices 
in addition  the new standard eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation 
this guidance is generally expected to result in revenue recognition for more delivered elements than under the current rules 
level is required to adopt this guidance prospectively for new or materially modified agreements as of january  the company elected to adopt this guidance prospectively for new or materially modified agreements as of january  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the company consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
in june  the fasb issued a new accounting standard that changes the consolidation rules as they relate to variable interest entities 
the new standard makes significant changes to the model for determining who should consolidate a variable interest entity  and also addresses how often this assessment should be performed 
the standard was effective for level effective january  the company adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the company consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued new accounting guidance to address concerns about performing the goodwill impairment test when a reporting unit has zero or negative carrying values 
the guidance requires the company to automatically perform step of the impairment test for reporting units with a zero or negative carrying amount if there are qualitative factors that indicate that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  these adverse qualitative factors should also be considered between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the adverse qualitative factors are part of existing accounting standards 
the guidance is effective for level on january  the company evaluated the adverse qualitative factors in anticipation of its january  adoption of the new accounting guidance and concluded that it was not required to perform step of the impairment test

other communications services includes revenue from managed modem and its related reciprocal compensation services and sbc contract services  which includes revenue from the sbc master services agreement  which was obtained in the december acquisition of wiltel 

table of contents communications revenue attributable to each of these services is as follows in millions year ended december  core network services wholesale voice services other communications services total communications services revenue communications revenue decreased in compared to the decrease in compared to is primarily the result of wholesale voice services and expected declines in other communications revenue 
the company core network services revenue in compared to was essentially flat 
full year declines in the company data  local and enterprise voice services were driven by lower usage of internet access and voice services which was primarily driven by macroeconomic conditions 
similar macroeconomic conditions driving declines in data service revenue and vyvx broadcast services during the first half of  strengthened to reflect growth during the second half of the year 
in addition  full year increases in transport and infrastructure services driven by strong demand led sequential quarterly improvement that offset the annual declines in data  local and enterprise voice services 
the decrease in wholesale voice services revenue in compared to is primarily attributable to a decline in international voice termination services that experienced pricing pressure during the year 
this decrease was offset by slight increases in domestic voice termination and toll free services 
the company continues to concentrate its sales efforts on maintaining incremental gross margins in the range for these services 
the company expects to experience some volatility in revenue as a result of this strategy 
other communications revenue declined to million in from million in the decrease is the result of a decline in managed modem revenue as a result of the continued migration from narrow band dial up services to higher speed broadband services by end user customers  especially in large metropolitan areas 
the company expects managed modem revenue to continue to decline in the future due to an increase in the number of subscribers migrating to broadband services 
reciprocal compensation revenue from managed modem services also declined in compared to as a result of the continuing decline in demand for managed modem services 
the company has historically earned the majority of its reciprocal compensation revenue from managed modem services  although the company continues to generate a portion of its reciprocal compensation revenue from voice services  which is reported within core network services revenue 
to the extent the company is unable to sign new interconnection agreements or signs new or amended agreements containing lower rates  reciprocal compensation revenue may experience further declines over time 
in addition  if there is a significant decline in the company managed modem dial up business  or fcc or state regulations change such that carriers are not required to compensate other carriers for terminating internet service provider bound traffic  reciprocal compensation revenue may continue to decline

table of contents amortization expense and non cash stock compensation expense included within selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
adjusted ebitda is not a measurement under gaap and may not be used in the same way by other companies 
management believes that adjusted ebitda is an important part of the company internal reporting and is a key measure used by management to evaluate profitability and operating performance of the company and to make resource allocation decisions 
management believes such measurement is especially important in a capital intensive industry such as telecommunications 
management also uses adjusted ebitda to compare the company performance to that of its competitors and to eliminate certain non cash and non operating items in order to consistently measure from period to period its ability to fund capital expenditures  fund growth  service debt and determine bonuses 
adjusted ebitda excludes non cash impairment charges and non cash stock compensation expense because of the non cash nature of these items 
adjusted ebitda also excludes interest income  interest expense and income tax benefit expense  because these items are associated with the company capitalization and tax structures 
adjusted ebitda also excludes depreciation and amortization expense because these non cash expenses reflect the effect of capital investments which management believes should be evaluated through cash flow measures 
adjusted ebitda excludes net other income expense because these items are not related to the primary operations of the company 
there are limitations to using non gaap financial measures  including the difficulty associated with comparing companies that use similar performance measures whose calculations may differ from the company calculations 
additionally  this financial measure does not include certain significant items such as interest income  interest expense  income tax benefit expense  depreciation and amortization expense  non cash impairment charges  non cash stock compensation expense and net other income expense 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered a substitute for other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap

the company incurs income tax expense attributable to income in various level subsidiaries  including the coal business  that are required to file state or foreign income tax returns on a separate legal entity basis 
the company also recognizes accrued interest and penalties in income tax expense related to uncertain tax positions 
the difference between the company effective tax rate and the us statutory rate was primarily due to the fact that the company continues to maintain a full valuation allowance against the majority of its net federal  state and certain foreign deferred tax assets

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk level is subject to market risks arising from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
as of december   the company had borrowed a total of billion primarily under a senior secured term loan due and floating rate senior notes due that bear interest at libor rates plus an applicable margin 
as the libor rates fluctuate  so too will the interest expense on amounts borrowed under these debt instruments 
the weighted average interest rate on the variable rate instruments at december   was approximately 
in march  level financing  inc  the company wholly owned subsidiary  entered into two interest rate swap agreements to hedge the interest payments on billion notional amount of floating rate debt 
the two interest rate swap agreements are with different counterparties and are for million each 
the interest rate swap agreements were effective beginning in and mature in 
table of contents january under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements  level receives interest payments based on rolling three month libor terms and pays interest at the fixed rate of under one arrangement and under the other 
level has designated the interest rate swap agreements as a cash flow hedge on the interest payments for billion of floating rate debt 
the remaining  or unhedged  variable rate debt of approximately billion has a weighted average interest rate of at december  a hypothetical increase in the weighted average rate by point ie a weighted average rate of would increase the company annual interest expense by approximately million 
at december   the company had billion excluding fair value adjustments  discounts and premiums of fixed rate debt bearing a weighted average interest rate of 
a decline in interest rates in the future will not benefit the company with respect to the fixed rate debt due to the terms and conditions of the indentures relating to that debt that would require the company to repurchase the debt at specified premiums if redeemed early 
indicated changes in interest rates are based on hypothetical movements and are not necessarily indicative of the actual results that may occur 
future earnings and losses will be affected by actual fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company conducts a portion of its business in currencies other than the us dollar  the currency in which the company consolidated financial statements are reported 
correspondingly  the company operating results could be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate volatility relative to the us dollar 
the company european subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency  as the majority of their revenue and purchases are transacted in their local currencies 
although the company continues to evaluate strategies to mitigate risks related to the effect of fluctuations in currency exchange rates  the company will likely recognize gains or losses from international transactions 
changes in foreign currency rates could adversely effect the company operating results
