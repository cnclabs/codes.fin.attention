item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes  which are included in this report  and the risk factors  set forth in item a above 
overview we began operations in as a california company making boardshorts for surfers in the united states under a license agreement with the quiksilver brand founders in torquay  australia 
our product offering expanded in the s as we expanded our distribution channels 
after going public in and purchasing the rights to the quiksilver brand in the us  we further expanded our product offerings and began to diversify 
in  we acquired the european licensee of quiksilver and introduced roxy  our surf brand for teenage girls 
we also expanded demographically in the s by adding products for boys  girls  toddlers and men  and we introduced our proprietary retail store concept that displays the heritage and products of quiksilver and roxy 
in  we acquired the international quiksilver and roxy trademarks  and in  we acquired our licensees in australia and japan 
in  we acquired dc shoes  inc to expand our presence in action sports inspired footwear 
in  we acquired skis rossignol sa  a wintersports and golf equipment company 
in november  we completed the sale of our rossignol wintersports business  which included the brands rossignol  dynastar  look and lange for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
we incurred a pre tax loss on the sale of rossignol of approximately million  partially offset by a tax benefit of approximately million  recognized primarily during the three months ended january  our rossignol business  including both wintersports equipment and related apparel  is classified as discontinued operations 
the assets and related liabilities of our remaining rossignol apparel business are classified as held for sale  and the operations are classified as discontinued in our 
table of contents consolidated financial statements 
also  as part of our acquisition of rossignol in  we acquired a majority interest in roger cleveland golf company  inc our golf equipment operations were subsequently sold in december and are also classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
as a result of these dispositions  the following information has been adjusted to exclude both our rossignol wintersports and golf equipment businesses 
during our fiscal year ended october   we closed a million debt for equity exchange with rh ne  completed an amendment to our americas credit facility  and closed a new americas term loan the proceeds of which were used to repay the remaining outstanding balance of our rh ne term loans following the debt for equity exchange 
subsequent to our fiscal year end  we issued million in seven year unsecured senior notes and used the proceeds to repay our european term loans 
as a result  we have significantly improved our balance sheet and our liquidity position compared to the prior year 
specifically  with the completion of these transactions  we have extended virtually all of our short term maturities to a long term basis  which provides us with the financial and operational flexibility to fully pursue the many growth opportunities within our own brands 
today our products are sold throughout the world  primarily in surf shops  skate shops  snow shops and specialty stores 
we operate in the outdoor market of the sporting goods industry in which we design  produce and distribute branded apparel  footwear  accessories and related products 
we operate in three segments  the americas  europe and asia pacific 
our americas segment includes revenues from the us  canada and latin america 
our european segment includes revenues from europe  the middle east and africa 
our asia pacific segment includes revenues primarily from australia  japan  new zealand and indonesia 
royalties earned from various licensees in other international territories are categorized in corporate operations along with revenues from sourcing services 
revenues by segment from continuing operations are as follows year ended october  in thousands americas europe asia pacific corporate operations total revenues  net we operate in markets that are highly competitive  and our ability to evaluate and respond to changing consumer demands and tastes is critical to our success 
if we are unable to remain competitive and maintain our consumer loyalty  our business will be negatively affected 
we believe that our historical success is due to the development of an experienced team of designers  artists  sponsored athletes  technicians  researchers  merchandisers  pattern makers and contractors 
our team and the heritage and current strength of our brands has helped us remain competitive in our markets 
our success in the future will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to design products that are desirable to the marketplace and competitive in the areas of quality  brand image  technical specifications  distribution methods  price  customer service and intellectual property protection 
results of operations during our fiscal year ended october   we continued to face difficult market conditions resulting in reduced net revenues  however  we were able to significantly improve our gross profit margin and our adjusted ebitda

our financial performance has been  and may continue to be  negatively affected by unfavorable global economic conditions 
continued or further deteriorating economic conditions are likely to have an adverse impact on our sales volumes  pricing levels and profitability 
as domestic and international economic conditions change  trends in discretionary consumer spending become unpredictable and subject to reductions due to uncertainties about the future 
when consumers reduce discretionary spending  purchases of apparel and footwear tend to decline 
a general reduction in consumer discretionary spending in the domestic and international economies or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues our total net revenues decreased in fiscal to  million from  million in fiscal in constant currency  net revenues decreased compared to the prior year 
our net revenues in each of the americas  europe and asia pacific segments include apparel  footwear  accessories and related products for our quiksilver  roxy  dc and other brands  which primarily include hawk  lib technologies  and gnu 
in order to better understand growth rates in our foreign operating segments  we make reference to constant currency 
constant currency improves visibility into actual growth rates as it adjusts for the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates from period to period 
constant currency is calculated by taking the ending foreign currency exchange rate for balance sheet items or the average foreign currency exchange rate for income statement items used in translation for the current period and applying that same rate to the prior period 
our european segment is translated into constant currency using euros and our asia pacific segment is translated into constant currency using australian dollars as these are the primary functional currencies of each segment 
as such  this methodology does not account for movements in individual currencies within an operating segment for example  non euro currencies within our european segment and japanese yen within our asia pacific segment 
a constant currency translation methodology that accounts for movements in each individual currency could yield a different result compared to using only euros and australian dollars

of these stores  still remain open and are planned to close at lease expiration or sooner if an early termination agreement can be reached

financial position  capital resources and liquidity we generally finance our working capital needs and capital investments with operating cash flows and bank revolving lines of credit 
multiple banks in the united states  europe and australia make these lines of credit available to us 
term loans are also used to supplement these lines of credit and are typically used to finance long term assets 
in fiscal  we issued million of unsecured senior notes senior notes to fund a portion of the rossignol purchase price and to refinance certain existing indebtedness 
in fiscal  we closed the million five year senior secured term loans with rh ne rh ne senior secured term loans  refinanced our existing asset based credit facility with a million three year asset based credit facility  and refinanced our short term uncommitted lines of credit in europe with a million multi year facility 
the closing of these transactions enabled us to extend a significant portion of our short term maturities to a long term basis 
however  the applicable interest rates on these refinanced obligations  particularly the rh ne senior secured term loans  were higher than the interest rates on the obligations they replaced 
these higher interest rates are reflected in our net interest expense of million for the fiscal year ended october   which represents an increase of million in interest expense over the fiscal year ended october  however  million of the total interest expense in fiscal was non cash interest 
on august   we closed a debt for equity exchange pursuant to which a combined total of million of principal balance outstanding under the rh ne senior secured term loans was exchanged for a total of million shares of our common stock 

table of contents on august   we entered into an amendment to our existing million asset based credit facility for our americas segment as amended  the credit facility 
the credit facility is a million facility with the option to expand the facility to million on certain conditions and the amendment  among other things  extended the maturity date of the credit facility to august  compared to july  under the original facility and changed the interest rate to libor plus a margin of to compared to libor plus a margin of to under the original facility  depending upon availability 
on october   we entered into a million term loan for our americas segment 
the maturity date of this term loan is august   such that it is aligned with the maturity of the credit facility 
proceeds from this term loan  together with approximately million of cash on hand  were used to repay the remaining amounts outstanding under the rh ne senior secured term loans 
as a result of the debt for equity exchange and the subsequent repayment of the remaining amounts outstanding under the rh ne senior secured term loans  we recognized approximately million in interest expense during the three months ended october  due to the write off of the deferred debt issuance costs that were capitalized in connection with the issuance of the rh ne senior secured term loans  as well as the debt discount that was recorded upon the issuance of the warrants associated with such senior secured term loans 
this charge was non recurring  non cash and non operating 
with the full repayment of these term loans  we expect to gain future annual interest expense savings of approximately million 
the closing of these transactions enabled us to significantly de lever our consolidated balance sheet 
as of october   we had a total of approximately million of indebtedness compared to a total of approximately  million of indebtedness at october  our total indebtedness declined primarily as a result of the debt for equity exchange  scheduled repayments made on our european long term debt  the payment of the deferred purchase price obligation from the rossignol acquisition and the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
subsequent to our fiscal year end  in december  we issued million approximately million at the date of issuance in unsecured senior notes european senior notes  which bear a coupon interest rate of and are due december  the proceeds from this offering were used to repay our existing european term loans and to pay related fees and expenses 
this transaction extended virtually all of our short term maturities to a long term basis 
as we used the proceeds from the european senior notes to repay our existing european term loans  we expect to recognize non cash  non operating charges during the fiscal quarter ending january  of approximately million to write off the deferred debt issuance costs related to such term loans 
in addition  we anticipate the debt issuance costs associated with the issuance of the european senior notes will be approximately million  which will be amortized into interest expense over the term of the european senior notes 
we believe that our cash flows from operations  together with our existing credit facilities  cash on hand and term loans will be adequate to fund our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we also believe that our short term uncommitted lines of credit in asia pacific will continue to be made available 
if these lines of credit are not made available  we would plan to extinguish any related debt using cash on hand or other existing credit facilities 
during fiscal  we obtained licenses from a software vendor in preparation for the implementation of a new global enterprise wide reporting system 
we are concluding the project planning stages and have begun implementation on a component of our business in the us during january as a result of the selection of this new system  we are currently evaluating our existing systems to determine if any may no longer be used upon implementation of the new system 
this evaluation could result in the write off of any systems that will no longer be in use  causing us to record future impairment losses 

table of contents unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled million at october  versus million at october  working capital amounted to million at october   compared to million at october   a decrease of 
operating cash flows operating activities of continuing operations provided cash of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this million increase was primarily due to the effect of our net loss and other non cash charges  which amounted to million  offset almost entirely by decreased cash provided from working capital of million 
capital expenditures we have historically avoided high levels of capital expenditures for our apparel production by using independent contractors for a vast majority of our production 
fiscal capital expenditures were million  which was approximately million less than the million we spent in fiscal these investments include company owned stores and ongoing investments in computer  warehouse and manufacturing equipment 
as discussed above  we plan to implement a new global enterprise wide reporting system 
the implementation costs of this project are expected to increase our level of capital expenditures over the next three years and the ongoing maintenance of this system could also require higher levels of investment as compared to our current systems 
capital spending for these and other projects in fiscal is expected to be in the range of million to million 
we intend to fund these expenditures from operating cash flows

our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of october  are summarized in the following table payments due by period two to four to after one three five five in thousands year years years years total operating lease obligations long term debt obligations professional athlete sponsorships certain other obligations excludes required interest payments 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for interest terms 
million due on our european term loans as of october  is included as due after five years as we issued the european senior notes in december and used the proceeds to repay our existing european term loans 
we establish relationships with professional athletes in order to promote our products and brands 
we have entered into endorsement agreements with professional athletes in sports such as surfing  skateboarding  snowboarding  bmx and motocross 
many of these contracts provide incentives for magazine exposure and competitive victories while wearing or using our products 
it is not possible to determine the amounts we may be required to pay under these agreements as they are subject to many variables 
the amounts listed are the approximate amounts of minimum obligations required to be paid under these contracts 
the estimated maximum 
table of contents amount that could be paid under existing contracts is approximately million and would assume that all bonuses  victories  etc 
are achieved during a five year period 
the actual amounts paid under these agreements may be higher or lower than the amounts listed as a result of the variable nature of these obligations 
certain other obligations include approximately million of contractual letters of credit with maturity dates of less than one year 
we also enter into unconditional purchase obligations with various vendors and suppliers of goods and services in the normal course of operations through purchase orders or other documentation or that are undocumented except for an invoice 
such unconditional purchase obligations are generally outstanding for periods less than a year and are settled by cash payments upon delivery of goods and services and are not reflected in this line item 
in addition  we may acquire additional equity interests from our minority interest partners in brazil and mexico  however  as we are not required to do so  and as these potential purchase amounts generally cannot be determined significantly in advance  they are not included in this line item 
we have approximately million of tax contingencies related to asc  income taxes 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for our complete income taxes disclosure 
based on the uncertainty of the timing of these contingencies  these amounts have not been included in this line item 
off balance sheet arrangements other than certain obligations and commitments described in the table above  we did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements as of october  trade accounts receivable and inventories our trade accounts receivable were million at october   compared to million the year before  a decrease of 
receivables in the americas segment decreased  while european segment receivables decreased and asia pacific segment receivables decreased 
in constant currency  consolidated trade accounts receivable also decreased 
the decrease in consolidated trade accounts receivable was a result of lower revenues and improved collections 
european segment receivables in constant currency decreased and asia pacific segment receivables in constant currency decreased 
included in trade accounts receivable are approximately million of value added tax and goods and services tax related to foreign accounts receivable 
such taxes are not reported as net revenues and as such  are deducted from accounts receivable to more accurately compute days sales outstanding 
overall average days sales outstanding decreased by approximately days at october  compared to october  consolidated inventories totaled million as of october   compared to million the year before  an increase of less than 
inventories in the americas segment increased  while european segment inventories decreased and asia pacific segment inventories increased 
in constant currency  consolidated inventories also increased less than 
european segment inventories in constant currency decreased and asia pacific segment inventories in constant currency decreased 
consolidated average inventory turnover decreased to times per year at october  compared to times per year at october  inflation inflation has been modest during the years covered by this report 
accordingly  inflation has had an insignificant impact on our sales and profits 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance included in accounting standard codification asc business combinations  which requires us to record fair value estimates of contingent consideration and certain other potential liabilities during the original purchase price allocation  expense acquisition costs as incurred and does not permit certain restructuring activities to be recorded as a component of purchase accounting 
in april  the fasb issued additional guidance that requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies be recognized at fair value  only if fair value can be reasonably estimated and eliminates the requirement to disclose an estimate of the range of outcomes of recognized contingencies at the acquisition date 
this guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning on or after december  we adopted this guidance at the beginning of our fiscal year ending october  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance included in asc consolidation  which requires noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries to be included in the equity section of the balance sheet 
this guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted this guidance at the beginning of our fiscal year ending october  in the year of adoption  presentation and disclosure requirements apply retrospectively to all periods presented 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
to prepare these financial statements  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
these estimates also affect our reported revenues and expenses 
judgments must also be made about the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
actual results could be significantly different from these estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses the accounting policies that are necessary to understand and evaluate our reported financial results 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when the risk of ownership and title passes to our customers 
generally  we extend credit to our customers and do not require collateral 
none of our sales agreements with any of our customers provide for any rights of return 
however  we do approve returns on a case by case basis at our sole discretion to protect our brands and our image 
we provide allowances for estimated returns when revenues are recorded  and related losses have historically been within our expectations 
if returns are higher than our estimates  our results of operations would be adversely affected 
accounts receivable it is not uncommon for some of our customers to have financial difficulties from time to time 
this is normal given the wide variety of our account base  which includes small surf shops  medium sized retail chains  and some large department store chains 
throughout the year  we perform credit evaluations of our customers  and we adjust credit limits based on payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness 
we continuously monitor our collections and maintain a reserve for estimated credit losses based on our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
we also use insurance on certain classes of receivables in our european segment 
historically  our losses have been consistent with our estimates  but there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past 
unforeseen  material financial difficulties of our customers could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
inventories we value inventories at the cost to purchase and or manufacture the product or the current estimated market value of the inventory  whichever is lower 
we regularly review our inventory quantities on hand  and adjust inventory values for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and market value 
demand for our products could fluctuate significantly 
the demand for our products could be negatively affected by many factors  including the following weakening economic conditions  terrorist acts or threats  unanticipated changes in consumer preferences  reduced customer confidence  and unseasonable weather 
some of these factors could also interrupt the production and or importation of our products or otherwise increase the cost of our products 
as a result  our operations and financial performance could be negatively affected 
additionally  our estimates of product demand and or market value could be inaccurate  which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
long lived assets we acquire tangible and intangible assets in the normal course of our business 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of these long lived assets including fixed assets  trademarks  licenses and other amortizable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
impairments are recognized in operating earnings 
we continually use judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment tests  the undiscounted 
table of contents cash flows used to assess impairments  and the fair value of a potentially impaired asset 
the reasonableness of our judgment could significantly affect the carrying value of our long lived assets 
goodwill we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at least annually based on a two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
fair value is computed based on estimated future cash flows discounted at a rate that approximates our cost of capital 
such estimates are subject to change  and we may be required to recognize impairment losses in the future 
as of october   the fair value of our americas and europe reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values 
for our asia pacific reporting unit  the fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 
goodwill allocated to our asia pacific reporting unit was million 
based on the uncertainty of future growth rates and other assumptions used to estimate goodwill recoverability in this reporting unit  future reductions in our expected cash flows for asia pacific could cause a material impairment of goodwill 
income taxes current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences of temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of our deferred tax assets 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized  we would reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value  thereby decreasing net income 
evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on our judgment 
if we subsequently determined that the deferred tax assets  which had been written down would  in our judgment  be realized in the future  the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased  thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made 
on november   we adopted the authoritative guidance included in asc income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements 
this guidance provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the tax position 
we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of our provision for income taxes 
the application of this guidance can create significant variability in our tax rate from period to period based upon changes in or adjustments to our uncertain tax positions 
stock based compensation expense we recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest using the graded vested method over the requisite service period of the award 
for option valuation  we determine the fair value using the black scholes option pricing model which requires the input of certain assumptions  including the expected life of the stock based payment awards  stock price volatility and interest rates 
foreign currency translation a significant portion of our revenues are generated in europe  where we operate with the euro as our functional currency  and a smaller portion of our revenues are generated in asia pacific  where we operate with the australian dollar and japanese yen as our functional currencies 
our european revenues in the united kingdom are denominated in british pounds  and substantial portions of our european and asia pacific product is sourced in us dollars  both of which result in exposure to gains and losses that could occur from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
revenues and expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the average exchange rate for the period 
assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet date 
gains and losses from assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity on which they reside are generally recognized currently in our statement of operations 
gains and 
table of contents losses from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements into us dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
as part of our overall strategy to manage our level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  we enter into various foreign currency exchange contracts generally in the form of forward contracts 
for all contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges  we record the changes in the fair value of the derivatives in other comprehensive income or loss 
forward looking statements all statements included in this report  other than statements or characterizations of historical fact  are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of examples of forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements regarding the trends and uncertainties in our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
these forward looking statements are based on our current expectations  estimates and projections about our industry  management s beliefs  and certain assumptions made by us and speak only as of the date of this report 
forward looking statements can often be identified by words such as anticipates  expects  intends  plans  predicts  believes  seeks  estimates  may  will  likely  should  would  could  potential  continue  ongoing  and similar expressions  and variations or negatives of these words 
in addition  any statements that refer to expectations  projections  guidance  forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances  including any underlying assumptions  are forward looking statements 
these statements are not guarantees of future results and are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
therefore  our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statement as a result of various factors  including  but not limited to  the following continuing deterioration of global economic conditions and credit and capital markets  our ability to remain compliant with our debt covenants  our ability to achieve the financial results that we anticipate  payments due on contractual commitments and other debt obligations  future expenditures for capital projects  including the implementation of our global enterprise wide reporting system  our ability to continue to maintain our brand image and reputation  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  increases in production costs  particularly with respect to cotton and other commodities  and raw materials  and changes in political  social and economic conditions and local regulations  particularly in europe and asia 
these forward looking statements are based largely on our expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control 
actual results could differ materially from these forward looking statements as a result of the risks described in item a 
risk factors included in this report  and other factors 
except as may be required by law  we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
in light of these risks and uncertainties  we cannot assure you that the forward looking information contained herein will  in fact  transpire 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks 
two of these risks are foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes in interest rates that affect interest expense 
see also note of our consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency and derivatives we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to certain sales  royalty income and product purchases of our international subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies 
we are also exposed to foreign 
table of contents currency gains and losses resulting from domestic transactions that are not denominated in us dollars  and to fluctuations in interest rates related to our variable rate debt 
furthermore  we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from the effect that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on the reported results in our consolidated financial statements due to the translation of the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries 
we use various foreign currency exchange contracts and intercompany loans as part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
on the date we enter into a derivative contract  we designate the derivative as a hedge of the identified exposure 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as the risk management objective and strategy for entering into various hedge transactions 
we identify in this documentation the asset  liability  firm commitment  or forecasted transaction that has been designated as a hedged item and indicate how the hedging instrument is expected to hedge the risks related to the hedged item 
we formally measure effectiveness of our hedging relationships both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis in accordance with our risk management policy 
we will discontinue hedge accounting prospectively if we determine that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item  when the derivative expires or is sold  terminated or exercised  if it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction being hedged by the derivative will not occur  because a hedged firm commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment  or if we determine that designation of the derivative as a hedge instrument is no longer appropriate 
derivatives that do not qualify or are no longer deemed effective to qualify for hedge accounting but are used by management to mitigate exposure to currency risks are marked to fair value with corresponding gains or losses recorded in earnings 
a gain of million was recognized related to these types of contracts during the fiscal year ended october  for all qualifying cash flow hedges  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income 
as of october   we were hedging forecasted transactions expected to occur through july assuming exchange rates at october  remain constant  million of losses  net of tax  related to hedges of these transactions are expected to be reclassified into earnings over the next months 
we enter into forward exchange and other derivative contracts with major banks and are exposed to foreign currency losses in the event of nonperformance by these banks 
we anticipate  however  that these banks will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts 
accordingly  we do not obtain collateral or other security to support the contracts 
translation of results of international subsidiaries as discussed above  we are exposed to financial statement gains and losses as a result of translating the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries 
we translate the local currency statements of operations of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars using the average exchange rate during the reporting period 
changes in foreign exchange rates affect our reported profits and can distort comparisons from year to year 
we use various foreign currency exchange contracts and intercompany loans to hedge the profit and loss effects of such exposure  but accounting rules do not allow us to hedge the actual translation of sales and expenses 
by way of example  when the us dollar strengthens compared to the euro  there is a negative effect on our reported results for our european operating segment 
it takes more profits in euros to generate the same amount of profits in stronger us dollars 
the opposite is also true 
that is  when the us dollar weakens there is a positive effect on the translation of our reported results from our european operating segment 
in addition  the statements of operations of our asia pacific segment are translated from australian dollars and japanese yen into us dollars  and there is a negative effect on our reported results for asia pacific when the us dollar is stronger in comparison to the australian dollar or japanese yen 
european revenues decreased in euros during the fiscal year ended october  compared to the fiscal year ended october  as measured in us dollars and reported in our consolidated 
table of contents statements of operations  european revenues decreased as a result of a stronger us dollar versus the euro in comparison to the prior year 
asia pacific revenues decreased in australian dollars during the fiscal year ended october  compared to the fiscal year ended october  as measured in us dollars and reported in our consolidated statements of operations  asia pacific revenues increased as a result of a stronger australian dollar and japanese yen versus the us dollar in comparison to the prior year 
interest rates most of our lines of credit bear interest based on libor or euribor plus a credit spread 
effective interest rates  therefore  will move up or down depending on market conditions 
the credit spreads are subject to change based on financial performance and market conditions upon refinancing 
interest expense also includes financing fees and related costs and can be affected by foreign currency exchange rate movement upon translating non us dollar denominated interest into dollars for reporting purposes 
the approximate amount of our remaining variable rate debt was million at october   and the weighted average effective interest rate at that time was 
if interest rates or credit spreads were to increase by ie to approximately  our income before tax would be reduced by approximately million based on these fiscal levels 
after giving effect to the issuance of the million of european senior notes in december and the use of such proceeds to repay all outstanding european term loans  the approximate amount of our variable rate debt would have been million at october   and the weighted average effective interest rate at that time would have been 
if interest rates or credit spreads were to increase by ie to approximately  our income before tax would be reduced by approximately million based on our revised debt structure
