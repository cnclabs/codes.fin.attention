overview the company we are engaged in researching  developing  and commercializing stem cell therapeutics and enabling tools and technologies for stem cell based research and drug discovery and development 
our research and development r d programs are primarily focused on identifying and developing potential cell based therapeutics which can either restore or support organ function 
in particular  since we relocated our corporate headquarters to california in  our r d efforts have been directed at refining our methods for identifying  isolating  culturing  and purifying the human neural stem cell and human liver engrafting cells hlec and developing these as potential cell based therapeutics for the central nervous system cns and the liver  respectively 
in our cns program  our hucns sc product candidate purified human neural stem cells is currently in clinical development for spinal cord injury and two neurodegenerative brain indications neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis ncl  a lysomal storage disorder often referred to as batten disease  and pelizeaus merzbacher disease pmd  a myelination disorder in the brain 
we expect to initiate in march a phase i ii clinical trial of our hucns sc cells in switzerland for the treatment of chronic spinal cord injury 
we received approval to conduct this trial from swissmedic in december in the united states  we are currently conducting a phase ib clinical trial in infantile and late infantile ncl 
we previously completed a phase i clinical trial in infantile and late infantile ncl  and the data from that trial showed that our hucns sc cells were well tolerated and non tumorigenic  and that there was evidence of engraftment and long term survival of the transplanted hucns sc cells 
in february  we completed patient accrual in our phase i clinical trial in pmd 
data from this trial is expected to be reported in early in addition  we plan to submit an ind to conduct a phase i ii clinical trial in a retinal disorder  such as age related macular degeneration  in late in our liver program  we are focused on identifying and developing liver cells as potential therapeutics for a range 
table of contents of liver diseases 
we recently identified a subset of our human liver engrafting cells hlec which we believe may be a candidate for product development  and we are working to characterize this subset 
for a brief description of our significant therapeutic research and development programs see overview research and development programs in the business section of part i  item of this form k 
we have also conducted research on several other cell types and in other areas  which could lead to other possible product candidates  process improvements or further research activities 
we are also engaged in developing and commercializing applications of our technologies to enable research  which we believe represent current and nearer term commercial opportunities 
our portfolio of technologies includes cell technologies relating to embryonic stem cells  induced pluripotent stem ips cells  and tissue derived adult stem cells  expertise and infrastructure for providing cell based assays for drug discovery  a cell culture products and antibody reagents business  and an intellectual property portfolio with claims relevant to cell processing  reprogramming and manipulation  as well as to gene targeting and insertion 
much of our these enabling technologies were acquired in april as part of our acquisition of the operations of stem cell sciences plc scs 
see note  acquisition of scs operations  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k for further information 
we have not derived any revenue or cash flows from the sale or commercialization of any products except for license revenue for certain of our patented cells and sales of cell culture products for use in research 
as a result  we have incurred annual operating losses since inception and expect to incur substantial operating losses in the future 
therefore  we are dependent upon external financing from equity and debt offerings and revenue from collaborative research arrangements with corporate sponsors to finance our operations 
we have no such collaborative research arrangements at this time and there can be no assurance that such financing or partnering revenue will be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
before we can derive revenue or cash inflows from the commercialization of any of our therapeutic product candidates  we will need to i conduct substantial in vitro testing and characterization of our proprietary cell types  ii undertake preclinical and clinical testing for specific disease indications  iii develop  validate and scale up manufacturing processes to produce these cell based therapeutics  and iv obtain required regulatory approvals 
these steps are risky  expensive and time consuming 
overall  we expect our r d expenses to be substantial and to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue the development and clinical investigation of our current and future product candidates 
however  expenditures on r d programs are subject to many uncertainties  including whether we develop our product candidates with a partner or independently 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our current product candidates will be subject to future collaboration  when such collaboration agreements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
in addition  there are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our cell based therapeutics  including future trial design and regulatory requirements  many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time given the stage of our development and the novel nature of stem cell technologies 
the regulatory pathways  both in the united states and internationally  are complex and fluid given the novel and  in general  clinically unproven nature of stem cell technologies 
at this time  due to such uncertainties and inherent risks  we cannot estimate in a meaningful way the duration of  or the costs to complete  our r d programs or whether  when or to what extent we will generate revenues or cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of any of our therapeutic product candidates 
while we are currently focused on advancing each of our product development programs  our future r d expenses will depend on the determinations we make as to the scientific and clinical prospects of each product candidate  as well as our ongoing assessment of the regulatory requirements and each product candidate s commercial potential 
given the early stage of development of our therapeutic product candidates  any estimates of when we may be able to commercialize one or more of these products would not be meaningful 
moreover  any estimate of the time and investment required to develop potential products based upon our proprietary hucns sc and hlec technologies will change depending on the ultimate approach or approaches we take to pursue them  the results of preclinical and clinical studies  and the content and timing of decisions made by the fda  swissmedic and other regulatory authorities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop any product successfully  or that we 
table of contents will be able to recover our development costs  whether upon commercialization of a developed product or otherwise 
we cannot provide assurance that any of these programs will result in products that can be marketed or marketed profitably 
if certain of our development stage programs do not result in commercially viable products  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the research markets served by our tools and technologies products are highly competitive  complex and dynamic 
technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace of change in biological research  and stem cell technologies have been evolving particularly fast 
we compete mainly by focusing on specialty media and antibody reagent products and cell based assays  which are custom designed for use in stem cell based research  where we believe our expertise  intellectual property and reputation give us competitive advantage 
we believe that  in this particular market niche  our products and technologies offer customers specific advantages over those offered by our competitors 
we compete by offering innovative  quality controlled products  consistently made and designed to produce reproducible results 
we continue to make investments in research and development  quality management  quality improvement  and product innovation 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments 
for the year ended december   we generated revenues from the sale of specialty cell culture products of approximately  we can give no assurances that we will be able to continue to generate such revenues in the future 
significant events therapeutic product development in february  we enrolled and dosed the first patient in our pmd trial at ucsf benioff children s hospital  marking the first time that neural stem cells have been transplanted as a potential treatment for a myelination disorder 
in february  the fourth and final patient for this trial was enrolled and transplanted with our hucns sc human neural stem cells 
in august  we published new preclinical data demonstrating that our proprietary human neural stem cells restore lost motor function in mice with chronic spinal cord injury 
this is the first published study to show that human neural stem cells can restore mobility even when administered at time points beyond the acute phase of trauma  suggesting the prospect of treating a much broader population of injured patients than previously demonstrated 
the paper was published in the international peer reviewed journal plos one 
in october  we initiated a phase ib clinical trial of our hucns sc human neural stem cells in neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis ncl  which is also often referred to as batten disease 
our goal for this phase ib trial is to enroll six patients with less advanced stages of the disease than those who participated in our first ncl trial  which was completed in january like the phase i ncl trial  this second trial is being conducted at oregon health science university ohsu doernbecher children s hospital  a leading medical center with nationally recognized programs in pediatric neurology and neurosurgery 
in december we received authorization from swissmedic  the swiss regulatory agency  to initiate a phase i ii clinical trial in switzerland of our hucns sc product candidate in chronic spinal cord injury 
the trial is designed to assess both safety and preliminary efficacy in patients with varying degrees of paralysis who are three to months post injury  and will progressively enroll patients based upon the severity of injury 
we expect to initiate the trial in march tools and technologies programs in january  we launched gs r tm  the first commercially available medium to enable the derivation  maintenance and growth of true germline competent rat embryonic stem cells 
gs r is expected to have significant utility in the creation of genetically engineered rat models of human disease for use in academic  medical and pharmaceutical research 
in february  we launched gs m tm  a new cell culture medium that enables the derivation and long term maintenance of true mouse ips cells 
gs m has been shown to increase the efficiency of reprogramming pre ips cells to derive fully pluripotent stem cells  and to maintain mouse ips cells in a pluripotent state in long term culture 

table of contents in june  a newly published independent research demonstrated that our gs m cell culture media formulation enhances the pluripotency of human embryonic stem and ips cells 
our gs m medium has already been shown to enable the derivation and long term maintenance of mouse ips cells 
with this new application of gs m  researchers may now be able to significantly advance human pluripotent stem cell research 
in december  we launched stem tm  stem tm and stem tm  three new antibody reagents that significantly improve the visualization of human cells  including human stem cells and their progeny 
these high potency antibody reagents  which expand the range of our sc proven portfolio of research products  provide tools for the detection  tracking and characterization of human cells both in vitro and when transplanted into animal models of human diseases 
in january  we launched stem tm and stem tm  two new antibody reagents that have utility for the isolation and detection of a range of different human cell types 
intellectual property and licensing activities in march  the united kingdom uk intellectual property office granted us patent number gb with broad claims covering true germline competent rat stem cells and genetically engineered rats derived from these cells 
the patented technology is expected to have significant utility to academic and pharmaceutical industry researchers by enabling them to create novel rat models for the study of human diseases 
in august  we announced that our technology was used by independent researchers to achieve the first genetically engineered rat derived from rat embryonic stem cells 
this breakthrough work  published in the international peer reviewed journal nature  makes possible the types of genetic manipulations previously only possible in mice 
both mice and rats are used as animal models of human disease  however certain aspects of the rat s physiology  behavior  and metabolism are closer to the human  making rats the preferred species for drug development and studying human disease 
financing and other business related activities in june  we appointed r 
scott greer to our board of directors 
mr 
greer is a successful entrepreneur with a proven track record in developing and growing life sciences companies  and adds more than twenty five years of life sciences and financial services industry experience to our board 
in addition  we reconstituted our strategic transactions committee  which mr 
greer chairs  as a standing committee of the board 
in june  we raised gross proceeds of  through the sale of  shares of common stock to an institutional investor at a price of per share 
no warrants were issued in this transaction 
the shares were sold under our effective shelf registration statement previously filed with the securities and exchange commission sec 
as part of the agreement  the institutional investor agreed to purchase an additional  shares of common stock twelve weeks after the initial closing  subject to our election to sell the additional shares 
in september  we decided not to sell the additional shares 
in october  we were awarded cash grants totaling  for projects related to our cns and liver programs 
these grants were certified under the federal government s qualifying therapeutic discovery project qtdp program  which was created as part of the patient protection and affordable care act of all four project applications submitted by us were approved  and we received the entire grant amounts in december in january  we sold  shares of our common stock to selected institutional investors at a price of per share 
we received net proceeds  after deducting offering expenses and fees  of approximately  the investors were also granted an option to purchase an additional  shares at per share 
the option was not exercised and expired on february  the shares were offered under our effective shelf registration statement filed with the sec on june  critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance with 
table of contents us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and we have established internal controls related to the preparation of these estimates 
actual results and the timing of the results could differ materially from these estimates 
warrant liability authoritative accounting guidance prescribes that warrants issued under contracts that could require net cash settlement should be classified as liabilities and contracts that only provide for settlement in shares should be classified as equity 
in order for a contract to be classified as equity  specific conditions must be met 
these conditions are intended to identify situations in which net cash settlement could be forced upon the issuer 
as part of both our november and november financings  we issued warrants with five year terms to purchase  and  shares of our common stock at and per share  respectively 
as the contracts include the possibility of net cash settlement  we are required to classify the fair value of the warrants issued as a liability  with subsequent changes in fair value to be recorded as income loss on change in fair value of warrant liability 
the fair value of the warrants is determined using the black scholes merton black scholes option pricing model and is affected by changes in inputs to that model including our stock price  expected stock price volatility  the contractual term  and the risk free interest rate 
our estimate of the expected volatility is based on historical volatility 
the expected term of the warrants is based on the time to expiration of the warrants from the date of measurement 
risk free interest rates are derived from the yield on us treasury debt securities 
we will continue to classify the fair value of the warrants as a liability until the warrants are exercised  expire or are amended in a way that would no longer require these warrants to be classified as a liability 
the estimated fair value of our warrant liability at december   was approximately  stock based compensation us gaap requires us to recognize expense related to the fair value of our stock based compensation awards  including employee stock options and restricted stock units 
employee stock based compensation is estimated at the date of grant based on the award s fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain assumptions  the most significant of which are our estimates of the expected volatility of the market price of our stock  the expected term of the award  and the risk free interest rate 
our estimate of the expected volatility is based on historical volatility 
the expected term represents the period during which our stock based awards are expected to be outstanding 
in  we estimated this amount based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the awards  vesting requirements  and expectation of future employee behavior  including post vesting terminations 
our estimate of the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury debt securities with maturities close to the expected term of the option as of the date of grant 
we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  our assumptions in future periods may change 
at the end of each reporting period we estimate forfeiture rates based on our historical experience within separate groups of employees and adjust stock based compensation expense accordingly 
for the year ended december   employee stock based compensation expense stock options  restricted stock units and k plan employer match in form of shares was approximately  as of december   total compensation cost related to unvested stock options and restricted stock units not yet recognized was approximately  which is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted average period of years 
wind down expenses rhode island in connection with our wind down of our research and manufacturing operations in lincoln  rhode island  and the relocation of our corporate headquarters and remaining research laboratories to california in october  we provided a reserve for our estimate of the exit cost obligation 
the reserve reflects estimates of the ongoing costs of our former research and administrative facility in lincoln  which we hold on a lease that terminates on june  
table of contents we are seeking to sublease  assign  sell  or otherwise divest ourselves of our interest in the facility at the earliest possible time  but we cannot determine with certainty a fixed date by which such events will occur  if at all 
in determining the facility exit cost reserve amount  we are required to consider our lease payments through the end of the lease term and estimate other relevant factors such as facility operating expenses  real estate market conditions in rhode island for similar facilities  occupancy rates  and sublease rental rates projected over the course of the leasehold 
we re evaluate the estimate each quarter  taking into account changes  if any  in each of the underlying factors 
the process is inherently subjective because it involves projections into time from the date of the estimate through the end of the lease and it is not possible to determine any of the factors except the lease payments with certainty over that period 
management forms its best estimate on a quarterly basis  after considering actual sublease activity  reports from our broker realtor about current and predicted real estate market conditions in rhode island  the likelihood of new subleases in the foreseeable future for the specific facility and significant changes in the actual or projected operating expenses of the property 
we discount the projected net outflow over the term of the lease to arrive at the present value  and adjust the reserve to that figure 
the estimated vacancy rate for the facility is an important assumption in determining the reserve because changes in this assumption have the greatest effect on estimated sublease income 
in addition  the vacancy rate estimate is the variable most subject to change  while at the same time it involves the greatest judgment and uncertainty due to the absence of highly predictive information concerning the future of the local economy and future demand for specialized laboratory and office space in that area 
the average vacancy rate of the facility over the last eight years through was approximately  varying from to 
as of december   based on current information available to management  the vacancy rate is projected to be approximately for  and approximately from through the end of the lease 
these estimates are based on actual occupancy as of december   predicted lead time for acquiring new subtenants  historical vacancy rates for the area and assessments by our broker realtor of future real estate market conditions 
if the assumed vacancy rate for to the end of the lease had been five percentage points higher or lower at december   then the reserve would have increased or decreased by approximately  similarly  a increase or decrease in the operating expenses for the facility from on would have increased or decreased the reserve by approximately  and a increase or decrease in the assumed average rental charge per square foot would have increased or decreased the reserve by approximately  management does not wait for specific events to change its estimate  but instead uses its best efforts to anticipate them on a quarterly basis 
for the year ended december   we recorded actual expenses against this reserve  net of subtenant income  of approximately  based on management s evaluation of the factors mentioned above  and particularly the projected vacancy rates described above  we adjusted the reserve in by recording an additional  as wind down expenses 
at december   the reserve was  australia on april   as part of our acquisition of the scs operations  we acquired certain operations near melbourne  australia 
in order to reduce operating complexity and expenses  we made the decision to close our site in australia and consolidate personnel and programs to our cambridge  uk and palo alto  california sites 
at june   we established a reserve of approximately  for the estimated costs to close down and exit our australia operations 
the reserve reflects the estimated cost to terminate our facility lease in australia which provided for an original termination date of december   employee termination benefits and other liabilities associated with the wind down and relocation of our operations in australia 
as of december   the facility lease agreement has been terminated and our operations in australia have been relocated to cambridge  uk and palo alto  california 
we recorded actual expenses  net of foreign currency translation changes  of approximately  against this reserve 
at december   we concluded that all costs related to the close down and exit of our australia operations have been recorded against the reserve and we closed the reserve by crediting the remaining reserve balance of  to wind down expense 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets patent and license costs goodwill of approximately  at december   relates to the acquisition of scs operations 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests 
if the assumptions and estimates used to allocate the purchase price are not correct  or if business conditions change  purchase price adjustments or future asset impairment charges could be required 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the evaluations  and it is possible  even likely  that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analysis are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges in a future period 
we completed our annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of  and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill 
other intangible assets  net were approximately  at december  intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized generally on a straight line basis over the periods benefited 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
prior to fiscal year  we capitalized certain patent costs  which are being amortized over the estimated life of the patent and would be expensed at the time such patents are deemed to have no continuing value 
since  all patent costs are expensed as incurred 
license costs are capitalized and amortized over the estimated life of the license agreement 
in  we wrote off the unamortized amount of approximately  for certain license agreements that we terminated 
impairment of long lived tangible assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if property  plant  and equipment are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its estimated fair market value 
in  we recorded a charge of approximately  to adjust the fair value of certain lab equipment we expect to dispose 
no such impairment was recognized during the years and income taxes when accounting for income taxes  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
income tax receivables and liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the amounts that more likely than not will be sustained upon ultimate settlement with taxing authorities 
developing our provision for income taxes and analyzing our tax positions requires significant judgment and knowledge of federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
we assess the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required 
based on such evidence that can be objectively verified  we determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the main factors that we consider include cumulative losses in recent years  income losses expected in future years  and the applicable statute of limitations 
tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized in the period in which one of the following conditions is satisfied the more likely than not recognition threshold is satisfied  the position is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation  or the statute of limitations for the taxing authority to examine and challenge the position has expired 
tax benefits associated with an uncertain tax position are reversed in the period in which the more likely than not recognition threshold is no longer satisfied 

table of contents we concluded that the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
results of operations our results of operations have varied significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and may vary significantly in the future due to the occurrence of material recurring and nonrecurring events  including without limitation the receipt and payment of recurring and nonrecurring licensing payments  the initiation or termination of research collaborations  the on going expenses to lease and maintain our rhode island facilities  other than temporary impairment of our financial assets  changes in estimated fair value of our warrant liability  and increasing operating costs

operating expenses operating expense totaled approximately  in   in  and  in change in change in versus versus operating expenses research development selling  general administrative wind down expenses total operating expenses research and development expenses our r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  costs associated with clinical trials and regulatory submissions  costs associated with preclinical activities such as toxicology studies  costs associated with cell processing and process development  certain patent related costs such as licensing  facilities related costs such as depreciation  lab equipment  and supplies 
clinical trial expenses include payments to vendors such as clinical research organizations  contract manufacturers  clinical trial sites  laboratories for testing clinical samples and consultants 
cumulative r d costs incurred since we refocused our activities on developing cell based therapeutics fiscal years through were approximately million 
over this period  the majority of these cumulative costs were related to i characterization of our proprietary hucns sc cell  ii expenditures for toxicology and other preclinical studies  preparation and submission of applications to regulatory agencies to conduct clinical trials and obtaining regulatory clearance to initiate such trials  all with respect to our hucns sc cells  iii preclinical studies and development of our human liver engrafting cells  iv costs associated with cell processing and process development  and v costs associated with our clinical studies 
we use and manage our r d resources  including our employees and facilities  across various projects rather than on a project by project basis for the following reasons 
the allocations of time and resources change as the needs and priorities of individual projects and programs change  and many of our researchers are assigned to more than one project at any given time 
furthermore  we are exploring multiple possible uses for each of our proprietary cell types  so much of our r d effort is complementary to and supportive of each of these projects 
lastly  much of our r d effort is focused on manufacturing processes  which can result in process improvements useful across cell types 
we also use external service providers to assist in the conduct of our clinical trials  to manufacture certain of our product candidates and to provide various other r d related products and services 
many of these costs and expenses are complementary to and supportive of each of our programs 
because we do not have a development collaborator for any of our product programs  we are currently responsible for all costs incurred with respect to our product candidates
