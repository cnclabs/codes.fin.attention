see part i  item business cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements for examples of statements made in this report which may be forward looking statements 
these statements involve risks and uncertainties and are based on various assumptions 
although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions  investors and prospective investors are cautioned that such statements are only projections  and there cannot be any assurance that these events or results will occur 
information about the primary risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual future results to differ materially from our historic results or the results described in the forward looking statements made in this report or presented elsewhere by management from time to time are included in part i  item a risk factors 
overview this md a should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
our business and results of operations are substantially dependent upon the demand for ate by semiconductor manufacturers and companies that specialize in the testing of ics 
demand for ate is driven by semiconductor manufacturers that are opening new  or expanding existing  semiconductor fabrication facilities or upgrading existing equipment  which in turn is dependent upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products incorporating semiconductors 
in the past  the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply  which often have a severe impact on the semiconductor industry demand for ate  including the products we manufacture 
this can cause wide fluctuations in both our orders and net revenues and  depending on our ability to react quickly to these shifts in demand  can significantly impact our results of operations 
these industry cycles are difficult to predict and in recent years have become more volatile and  in certain cases  shorter in duration 
because the industry cycles are generally characterized by sequential periods of growth or declines in orders and net revenues during each cycle  year over year comparisons of operating results may not always be as meaningful as comparisons of periods at similar points in either up or down cycles 
in addition  during both downward and upward cycles in our industry  in any given quarter  the trend in both our orders and net revenues can be erratic 
this can occur  for example  when orders are canceled or currently scheduled delivery dates are accelerated or postponed by a significant customer or when customer forecasts and general business conditions fluctuate during a quarter 
we believe that purchases of most of our products are typically made from semiconductor manufacturers capital expenditure budgets 
certain portions of our business  however  are generally less dependent upon the capital expenditure budgets of the end users 
for example  purchases of certain related ate interface products  such as sockets and interface boards  which must be replaced periodically  are typically made from the end users operating budgets 
in addition  purchases of certain of our products  such as docking hardware  for the purpose of upgrading or improving the utilization  performance and efficiency of existing ate  tend to be counter cyclical to sales of new ate 
moreover  we believe a portion of our sales of thermal products results from the increasing need for temperature testing of circuit boards and specialized components that do not have the design or quantity to be tested in an electronic device handler 
in addition  we market our thermostream temperature intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued management systems in industries outside semiconductor test  such as the automotive  aerospace  medical and telecommunications industries 
we believe that these industries usually are less cyclical than the ate industry 
while the majority of our orders and net revenues are derived from the ate market  our operating results do not always follow the overall trend in the ate market in any given period 
we believe that these anomalies may be driven by a variety of changes within the ate market  including  for example  changing product requirements  longer time periods between new product offerings by oems and changes in customer buying patterns 
in particular  demand for our mechanical and electrical products  which are sold exclusively within the ate industry  and our operating margins in these product segments have been affected by shifts in the competitive landscape  including i customers placing heightened emphasis on shorter lead times which places increased demands on our available engineering and production capacity increasing unit costs and ordering in smaller quantities which prevents us from acquiring component materials in larger volumes at lower cost and increasing unit costs  ii the increasing practice of oem manufacturers to specify other suppliers as primary vendors  with less frequent opportunities to compete for such designations  iii the increased role of third party test and assembly houses in the ate market and their requirement of products with a greater range of use at the lowest cost  and iv customer supply line management groups demanding lower prices and spreading purchases across multiple vendors 
these shifts in market practices have had  and may continue to have  varying levels of impact on our operating results  which are difficult to quantify or predict from period to period 
management has taken  and will continue to take  such actions it deems appropriate to adjust our strategies  products and operations to counter such shifts in market practices as they become evident 
net revenues and orders the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  a breakdown of the net revenues from unaffiliated customers both by product segment and geographic area based on the location to which the goods are shipped 
years ended december  net revenues from unaffiliated customers mechanical products thermal products electrical products intersegment sales intersegment sales mechanical products thermal products electrical products net revenues from unaffiliated customers net of intersegment sales mechanical products thermal products electrical products years ended december  net revenues from unaffiliated customers us foreign our consolidated net revenues for the year ended december  increased million or as compared to for the year ended december   net revenues net of intersegment sales of our mechanical  thermal and electrical intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued products segments increased million or  million or and million or  respectively  compared to the increase in our consolidated net revenues during as compared to reflects continued strong demand in the ate industry that began in the second half of during the first half of  we continued to experience a significant decline in demand in all of our product segments that had begun in the second half of and worsened significantly as the global economic recession that began in late continued into as progressed  however  the ate industry began to experience increased levels of demand which resulted in increased levels of orders for our products 
the increased level of demand in the ate industry continued throughout although the level of demand for our products in any given quarter during exceeded that which we experienced for the comparable quarter during  we experienced fluctuations in the level of our orders and our net revenues on a sequential quarterly basis during during the first quarter of  our consolidated orders increased million or  from the level experienced in the fourth quarter of however  in the second and third quarters of  we experienced sequential quarterly declines in the level of our consolidated orders of million or and million or  respectively 
this trend reversed in the fourth quarter of as we experienced a million or increase in our orders during the fourth quarter of as compared to the third quarter of with respect to our consolidated net revenues  we experienced sequential quarterly increases during the first and second quarters of of million or and million or  respectively 
this was followed by sequential quarterly declines in the third and fourth quarters of of million or and million or  respectively 
however  as a result of the increase in our consolidated orders during the fourth quarter of  we currently expect our net revenues during the first quarter of to exceed the level recorded in the fourth quarter of although it currently appears that demand within the ate industry remains strong  we cannot be certain what the level of our orders or net revenues will be in any future period for any of our product segments 
backlog at december   our backlog of unfilled orders for all products was approximately million compared with approximately million at december  our backlog includes customer orders which we have accepted  substantially all of which we expect to deliver in while backlog is calculated on the basis of firm purchase orders  a customer may cancel an order or accelerate or postpone currently scheduled delivery dates 
our backlog may be affected by the tendency of customers to rely on short lead times available from suppliers  including us  in periods of depressed demand 
in periods of increased demand  there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog 
as a result  our backlog at a particular date is not necessarily indicative of sales for any future period 
business restructuring initiatives in response to the significant decline in our orders and net revenues during and early  we took actions to reduce our cost structure  including facility closures  workforce reductions and temporary salary and benefits reductions 
the actions we took during are discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we consider some of the actions we took to be temporary in nature  such as certain salary and benefits reductions for current employees 
at the time we took these temporary actions  it was generally our intent to restore all or a portion of the reduced salary and benefits in future periods when our results of operations and our cash flows improved sufficiently so as to allow us to do so 
any such restoration would impact the ultimate level of savings which will result from our restructuring actions 
effective january   we restored all of the temporary salary reductions we implemented in and for our domestic employees  with the exception of the salary of our executive chairman  which was restored to approximately of its full reinstated level  reflecting a voluntary continued reduction in his salary 
also on this date  we restored the fees paid to our board of directors  which had been reduced by approximately 
effective april   we restored the k plan discretionary matching contribution for all domestic employees and the temptronic profit sharing contributions which had been suspended for most of these employees at the beginning of there are no other temporary actions remaining to be restored 
product customer mix our three product segments each have multiple products that we design  manufacture and sell to our customers 
the gross margin on each product we offer is affected by a number of factors including the amount of intellectual property such as intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued patents utilized in the product  the number of units ordered by the customer at one time  or the amount of intest designed and fabricated material included in our product compared with the amount of third party designed and fabricated material included in our product 
the weight of each of these factors  as well as the current market conditions  determines the ultimate sales price we can obtain for our products and the resulting gross margin 
the mix of products we sell in any period is ultimately determined by our customers needs 
therefore  the mix of products sold in any given period can change significantly from the prior period 
as a result  our consolidated gross margin can be significantly impacted in any given period by a change in the mix of products sold in that period 
we sell most of our products to semiconductor manufacturers and third party test and assembly houses end user sales and to ate manufacturers oem sales who ultimately resell our equipment with theirs to semiconductor manufacturers 
our thermal products segment also sells into a variety of other industries including the aerospace  automotive  communications  consumer electronics  defense  and medical industries 
the mix of customers during any given period will affect our gross margin due to differing sales discounts and commissions 
for the years ended december  and  our oem sales as a percentage of net revenues were and  respectively  and our sales of thermal products in other industries outside the ate industry as a percentage of net revenues were and  respectively 
oem sales generally have a lower gross margin than end user sales  as oem sales historically have had a more significant discount 
our current net operating margins on most oem sales  however  are only slightly less than margins on end user sales because of the payment of third party sales commissions on most end user sales 
we have also continued to experience demands from our oem customers supply line managers to reduce our sales prices to them 
if we cannot further reduce our manufacturing and operating costs  these pricing pressures will continue to reduce our gross and operating margins 
results of operations all of our products are used by semiconductor manufacturers in conjunction with ate in the testing of ics 
in addition  some of the products manufactured by our thermal products segment are used in industries outside of the semiconductor industry  including the aerospace  automotive  communications  consumer electronics  defense and medical industries 
the results of operations for each product segment are generally affected by the same factors 
separate discussions and analyses for each product segment would be repetitive and obscure any unique factors that affected the results of operations of our different product segments 
the discussion and analysis that follows  therefore  is presented on a consolidated basis and includes discussion of factors unique to each product segment where significant to an understanding of that segment 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the principal items included in the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total net revenues 
percentage of net revenues years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin selling expense engineering and product development expense general and administrative expense restructuring and other charges operating income loss other income earnings loss before income tax expense benefit income tax expense benefit net earnings loss intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in  an increase of million or 
net revenues net of intersegment sales of our mechanical  thermal and electrical products segments increased million or  million or and million or  respectively 
we believe the significant increase in our net revenues primarily reflects the increased level of demand in the ate industry in as compared to  as previously discussed in the overview 
we believe the higher year over year increases in the net revenues of both our mechanical and electrical products segments reflects the fact that these segments historically have been the first to experience improved demand following a downturn  while our thermal products segment has historically trailed these other two segments by approximately six months in experiencing improved demand following a downturn 
additionally  our thermal products segment has historically experienced lower overall percentage increases and decreases in the level of its orders and net revenues throughout the cycles within the ate industry 
we attribute this to both its diversification outside of the ate market  as previously discussed  as well as to the fact that a portion of this segment product sales are for use in research and development activities which are still ongoing during industry downturns  although potentially at a reduced level 
during the year ended december   our net revenues from customers in the us increased and our net revenues from foreign customers increased  respectively  as compared to the same period in the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the increase in net revenues from foreign customers was less than 
the higher percentage increase for our foreign customers primarily reflects the increasing number of semiconductor fabrication facilities  including third party test and assembly houses  which are based overseas 
gross margin 
gross margin was for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in the improvement in gross margin is primarily the result of a decrease in our fixed operating costs as a percentage of net revenues 
although in absolute dollar terms  our fixed operating costs increased  during as compared to  these costs represented only of net revenues during compared to of net revenues during the significant decrease as a percentage of net revenues reflects that these costs were more fully absorbed by the much higher net revenue levels in the increase in the absolute dollar value of these costs primarily reflects increased salary and benefits expense due to the reinstatement during of certain salaries and benefits which had been temporarily reduced during as a part of our cost containment initiatives 
this increase was partially offset by higher utilization rates at our machine shop in cherry hill  new jersey combined with lower levels of depreciation and rent 
in addition to the decline in our fixed operating costs as a percentage of net revenues  both our charges for obsolete and excess inventory and our direct labor costs also decreased as a percentage of net revenues during as compared to our charges for obsolete and excess inventory decreased  in absolute dollar terms  and declined from of net revenues for to of net revenues for the  reduction in these charges primarily reflects that more items were falling into our objective criteria and being written off during when our volume of sales was significantly lower as compared to although our direct labor costs decreased from of net revenues for to of net revenues for as a result of the higher net revenue levels  the absolute dollar amount of these costs increased  primarily reflecting the hiring of additional staff as well as an increase in overtime resulting from the significant increase in our production levels 
the decrease as a percentage of net revenues in our fixed operating costs  charges for obsolete and excess inventory and direct labor were partially offset by an increase in our component material costs as a percentage of net revenues  reflecting changes in product and customer mix 
selling expense 
selling expense was million for year ended december  compared to million for the same period in  an increase of million or 
the increase in selling expense primarily reflects higher levels of commissions as a result of the significant increase in net revenues experienced in as compared to to a lesser extent  there was also an increase in accruals for product warranty which were also driven by the higher revenue levels in engineering and product development expense 
engineering and product development expense was million for year ended december  compared to million for the same period in  an increase of  or 
the increase in engineering and product development expense primarily reflects higher salaries and benefits expense as a result of the aforementioned reinstatement of salaries and benefits during general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in  an increase of  or 
the increase primarily reflects the accrual of profit related bonuses on our results for to a lesser extent there was also an increase in fees paid to our intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued board of directors and costs associated with our investor relations activities 
the level of fees paid to our board of directors had been reduced in as a part of our cost containment initiatives 
these fees were reinstated during these increases were partially offset by a reduction in professional fees  primarily reflecting a reduction in the number and extent of our consultations with our third party legal counsel regarding various corporate governance and compliance matters 
restructuring and other charges 
there were no restructuring and other charges for the year ended december  restructuring and other charges were  for the year ended december  the charges incurred during represent one time termination benefits and facility closure costs related to workforce reductions and facility closures that were part of our business restructuring initiatives implemented during other income expense 
other income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the comparable period in  a decrease of  the decrease primarily represents a decrease in foreign currency gains which was partially offset by the recording of a gain on the sale of certain fully depreciated machinery and equipment 
during  we recorded a  foreign exchange transaction gain related to the final dissolution of our subsidiary in japan during the fourth quarter of that year 
there was no similar gain recorded in income tax expense 
for the year ended december   we recorded income tax expense of  compared to an income tax benefit of  for the same period in on a quarterly basis  we record income tax expense or benefit based on the expected annualized effective tax rate for the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate our businesses 
due to our history of operating losses in both our domestic and certain of our foreign operations  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of these operations  including net operating loss carryforwards  where we believe it is more likely than not that we will not have sufficient taxable income to utilize these assets before they expire 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operations for the year ended december  was million compared to net cash used in operations of million for the same period in the shift from net cash used in operations to net cash provided by operations primarily reflects our net earnings of million for as compared to our net loss of million for during  accrued wages and benefits increased million which primarily reflects the accrual of profit based bonuses on our results for  and  to a lesser extent  the restoration of salaries and benefits that had been temporarily reduced or suspended as a part of our cost containment efforts during and accounts payable decreased  during  primarily reflecting the timing of our payments to vendors 
trade accounts receivable increased  and inventory increased  during which primarily reflects the increase in the level of business during restricted certificates of deposit increased  reflecting the purchase of certificates of deposit which are pledged to support letters of credit issued as security deposits under two separate lease agreements we entered into during one of these leases is for a facility in mt 
laurel  new jersey to which our operation in cherry hill  new jersey relocated in january the other lease is for a facility in mansfield  massachusetts to which our operation in sharon  massachusetts relocated in february purchases of property and equipment were  for the year ended december  these purchases included rental equipment and a new car for our thermal products segment operation in germany  a new tester for our electrical products segment that will be used primarily for quality assurance activities for this operation  and leasehold improvements related to our new facilities in new jersey and massachusetts  as previously discussed 
we have no significant commitments for capital expenditures for  however  depending upon changes in market demand  we may make such purchases as we deem necessary and appropriate 
as a result of our acquisition of sigma in october  we had non negotiable promissory notes in an aggregate principal amount of million outstanding as of the end of these notes were fully repaid during the fourth quarter of we have a secured credit facility that provides for maximum borrowings of  we have not used this credit facility to borrow any funds 
our usage consists of the issuance of letters of credit in the face amount of  this facility is secured by pledged certificates of deposit totaling  we pay a quarterly fee of per annum on the total amount of the outstanding letters of credit 
this credit facility expires on september  on april  and november   two additional letters of credit were issued in the face amounts of  and  respectively 
these letters of credit are supported by separate pledged certificates of deposit that are not a part of our secured credit facility 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
we currently expect our cash and cash equivalents and projected future cash flow to be sufficient to support our short term working capital requirements 
we do not currently have any available credit facilities under which we can borrow to help fund our working capital requirements 
we cannot be certain that  if needed  we would be able to obtain any credit facilities or under what terms such credit facilities would be available 
new or recently adopted accounting standards see note to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning the implementation and impact of new or recently adopted accounting standards 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventories  long lived assets  goodwill  identifiable intangibles  deferred income tax valuation allowances and product warranty reserves 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
some of these accounting estimates and assumptions are particularly sensitive because of their significance to our consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from what had been assumed when the financial statements were prepared 
inventory valuation inventory is valued at standard cost  which approximates actual cost computed on a first in  first out basis  not in excess of market value 
on a quarterly basis  we review our inventories and record excess and obsolete inventory charges based upon our established objective excess and obsolete inventory criteria 
these criteria identify material that has not been used in a work order during the prior twelve months and the quantity of material on hand that is greater than the average annual usage of that material over the prior three years 
in certain cases  additional charges for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based upon current industry conditions  anticipated product life cycles  new product introductions and expected future use of the inventory 
the charges for excess and obsolete inventory that we record establish a new cost basis for the related inventory 
in  we recorded an inventory obsolescence charge for excess and obsolete inventory of goodwill  intangible and long lived assets goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter  on a reporting unit basis  or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
factors we consider important which could indicate impairment include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the goodwill impairment assessment is based upon a combination of the income approach  which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based upon a discounted cash flow approach  and the market approach which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based upon comparable market multiples 
this fair value is then reconciled to our market capitalization at year end with an appropriate control premium 
the determination of the fair value of our reporting units requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions including the selection of appropriate peer group companies  control premiums  discount rate  terminal growth rates  forecasts of revenue and expense growth rates  changes in working capital  depreciation  amortization and capital expenditures 
changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions would have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting unit or the amount of the goodwill impairment charge 
during the goodwill impairment assessment  we perform a step i test to identify potential impairment  in which the fair value of a reporting unit is compared with its book value 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a step ii test is performed in which the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess 
as of december   goodwill was million 
during  we did not record any impairment charges related to our goodwill 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
as of december   indefinite lived intangible assets were  during  we did not record any impairment charges related to our indefinite lived intangible assets 
long lived assets  which consist of finite lived intangible assets and property and equipment  are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset 
if impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
the cash flow estimates used to determine the impairment  if any  contain management best estimates using appropriate assumptions and projections at that time 
at december   finite lived intangibles and long lived assets were million 
during  we did not record any impairment charges related to our long lived assets 
income taxes deferred tax assets are analyzed to determine if there will be sufficient taxable income in the future in order to realize such assets 
we assess all of the positive and negative evidence concerning the realizability of the deferred tax assets  including our historical results of operations for the recent past and our projections of future results of operations  in which we make subjective determinations of future events 
if  after assessing all of the evidence  both positive and negative  a determination is made that the realizability of the deferred tax assets is not more likely than not  we establish a deferred tax valuation allowance for all or a portion of the deferred tax assets depending upon the specific facts 
if any of the significant assumptions were changed  materially different results could occur  which could significantly change the amount of the deferred tax valuation allowance established 
as of december   due to our history of operating losses  we have a valuation allowance against all deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforwards  where we believe it is more likely than not that we will not have sufficient taxable income to utilize these assets before they expire 
product warranty accrual in connection with the accrual of warranty costs associated with our products  we make assumptions about the level of product failures that may occur in the future 
these assumptions are primarily based upon historical claims experience 
should the rate of future product failures significantly differ from historical levels  our accrued warranty reserves would need to be adjusted  and the amount of the adjustment could be material 
at december   accrued warranty was  and we recorded charges related to product warranty of  for the year then ended 
off balance sheet arrangements there were no off balance sheet arrangements during the year ended december  that have or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our interests
