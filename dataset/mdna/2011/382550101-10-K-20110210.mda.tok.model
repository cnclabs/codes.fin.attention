item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources overview 
we have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results 
the financial position and results of operations of our international subsidiaries are initially recorded in various foreign currencies and then translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements 
the strengthening of the us dollar against these foreign currencies ordinarily has a negative impact on our reported sales and operating margin and conversely  the weakening of the us dollar against these foreign currencies has a positive impact 
for the year ended december   foreign currency translation unfavorably affected sales by million and unfavorably affected segment operating income by million compared to the year ended december  the volatility of currency exchange rates may materially adversely affect our operating results 

table of contents our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk  which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 
certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk 
if interest rates increase  our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same  which would require us to use more of our available cash to service our indebtedness 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into swap agreements or other hedging arrangements in the future  or that existing or future hedging arrangements will offset increases in interest rates 
as of december   we had approximately billion of variable rate debt outstanding 
we have substantial fixed costs and  as a result  our operating income fluctuates disproportionately with changes in our net sales 
we operate with significant operating and financial leverage 
significant portions of our manufacturing  selling  administrative and general expenses are fixed costs that neither increase nor decrease proportionately with sales 
in addition  a significant portion of our interest expense is fixed 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to reduce our fixed costs proportionately in response to a decline in our net sales and therefore our competitiveness could be significantly impacted 
as a result  a decline in our net sales would result in a higher percentage decline in our income from operations and net income 
we may incur significant costs in connection with asbestos claims 
we are among many defendants named in legal proceedings involving claims of individuals relating to alleged exposure to asbestos 
at december   approximately  claims were pending against us alleging various asbestos related personal injuries purported to have resulted from alleged exposure to asbestos in certain rubber encapsulated products or aircraft braking systems manufactured by us in the past or to asbestos in certain of our facilities 
we expect that additional claims will be brought against us in the future 
our ultimate liability with respect to such pending and unasserted claims is subject to various uncertainties  including the following the number of claims that are brought in the future  the costs of defending and settling these claims  the risk of insolvencies among our insurance carriers  the possibility that adverse jury verdicts could require us to pay damages in amounts greater than the amounts for which we have historically settled claims  the risk of changes in the litigation environment or federal and state law governing the compensation of asbestos claimants  and the risk that the bankruptcies of other asbestos defendants may increase our costs 
because of the uncertainties related to such claims  it is possible that we may incur a material amount of cost in excess of our current reserve for such claims 
in addition  if any of the foregoing risks were to materialize  the resulting costs could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity  financial position and results of operations in future periods 
for further information regarding our asbestos liabilities  refer to the note to the consolidated financial statements  no 
 commitments and contingent liabilities 
we may be required to provide letters of credit or post cash collateral if we are subject to a significant adverse judgment or if we are unable to obtain surety bonds  which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
we are subject to various legal proceedings 
if we wish to appeal any future adverse judgment in any of these proceedings  we may be required to post an appeal bond with the relevant court 
in that case  we may be required to issue a letter of credit to the surety posting the bond 
we may issue up to an aggregate of million in letters of credit under our billion us senior secured first lien credit facility 
as of december   we had million in letters of credit issued and  million of remaining availability under this facility 
if we are subject to a significant adverse judgment and do not have sufficient availability under our credit facilities to issue a letter of credit to support an appeal bond  we may be required to pay down borrowings under the facilities or deposit 
table of contents cash collateral in order to stay the enforcement of the judgment pending an appeal 
if we are unable to post cash collateral  we may be unable to stay enforcement of the judgment 
under standard terms in the surety market  sureties issue or continue bonds on a case by case basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of collateral as a condition to issuing or renewing any bonds 
if surety providers were to limit or eliminate our access to bonding  we would need to post other forms of collateral  such as letters of credit or cash 
as described above  we may be unable to secure sufficient letters of credit under our credit facilities 
if we were subject to a significant adverse judgment or experienced an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity  we may be required to provide letters of credit or post cash collateral  which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
we are subject to extensive government regulations that may materially adversely affect our operating results 
we are subject to regulation by the department of transportation through the national highway traffic safety administration  or nhtsa  which has established various standards and regulations applicable to tires sold in the united states and tires sold in a foreign country that are identical or substantially similar to tires sold in the united states 
nhtsa has the authority to order the recall of automotive products  including tires  having safety related defects 
the transportation recall enhancement  accountability  and documentation act  or tread act  imposes numerous requirements with respect to the early warning reporting of warranty claims  property damage claims  and bodily injury and fatality claims and also requires tire manufacturers  among other things  to conform with revised and more rigorous tire testing standards 
compliance with the tread act regulations has increased  and will continue to increase  the cost of producing and distributing tires in the united states 
in addition  while we believe that our tires are free from design and manufacturing defects  it is possible that a recall of our tires  under the tread act or otherwise  could occur in the future 
a substantial recall could have a material adverse effect on our reputation  operating results and financial position 
in addition  as required by the energy independence and security act of  nhtsa will establish a national tire fuel efficiency consumer information program 
when the related rule making process is completed  certain tires sold in the united states will be required to be rated for rolling resistance  traction and tread wear 
while the federal law will pre empt state tire fuel efficiency laws adopted after january   we may become subject to additional tire fuel efficiency legislation  either in the united states or other countries 
our european operations are subject to regulation by the european union 
in  two important regulations  the tire safety regulation and the tire labeling regulation  applicable to tires sold in the european union were adopted 
the tire safety regulation sets performance standards that tires for cars and light and commercial trucks need to meet for rolling resistance  wet grip braking and noise in order to be sold in the european union  and will become effective between and the tire labeling regulation applies to all car and light and commercial truck tires produced after july  and requires that tires be labeled to inform consumers about the tire s fuel efficiency  wet grip and noise characteristics 
for both of these regulations  additional implementing rules are being developed and are expected to be finalized by the end of tires produced or sold in europe also have to comply with various other standards  including environmental laws such as reach registration  evaluation  authorisation and restriction of chemical substances  which regulates the use of chemicals in the european union 
for example  since january   reach has prohibited the use of highly aromatic oils in tires  which were used as compounding components to improve certain safety related performance characteristics  such as grip 
these us and european regulations  rules adopted to implement these regulations  or other similar regulations that may be adopted in the united states  europe or elsewhere in the future may require us to alter or increase our capital spending and research and development plans or cease the production of certain tires  which could have a material adverse affect on our operating results 

table of contents laws and regulations governing environmental and occupational safety and health are complicated  change frequently and have tended to become stricter over time 
as a manufacturing company  we are subject to these laws and regulations both inside and outside the united states 
we may not be in complete compliance with such laws and regulations at all times 
our costs or liabilities relating to them may be more than the amount we have reserved  and that difference may be material 
in addition  our manufacturing facilities may become subject to further limitations on the emission of greenhouse gases due to public policy concerns regarding climate change issues or other environmental or health and safety concerns 
while the form of any additional regulations cannot be predicted  a cap and trade system similar to the one adopted in the european union could be adopted in the united states 
any such cap and trade system including the system currently in place in the european union or other limitations imposed on the emission of greenhouse gases could require us to increase our capital expenditures  use our cash to acquire emission credits or restructure our manufacturing operations  which could have a material adverse affect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
compliance with the laws and regulations described above or any of the myriad of applicable foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations currently in effect or that may be adopted in the future could materially adversely affect our competitive position  operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
the terms and conditions of our global alliance with sumitomo rubber industries  ltd 
provide for exit rights available to sri upon the occurrence of certain events  which could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire sri s interest in our european and north american joint ventures 
under the global alliance agreements between us and sri  sri has the right to require us to purchase its ownership interests in gdte and gdtna if certain triggering events have occurred  including certain bankruptcy events  changes in control of goodyear or breaches of the global alliance agreements 
while we have not done any current valuation of these businesses  any payment required to be made to sri pursuant to an exit under the terms of the global alliance agreements could be substantial 
we cannot assure you that our operating performance  cash flow and capital resources would be sufficient to make such a payment or  if we were able to make the payment  that there would be sufficient funds remaining to satisfy our other obligations 
the withdrawal of sri from the global alliance could also have other adverse effects on our business  including the loss of technology and purchasing synergies

if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially adversely affected 
our business substantially depends on the continued service of key members of our management 
the loss of the services of a significant number of members of our management could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel  such as engineering  marketing and senior management professionals 
competition for these employees is intense  and we could experience difficulty from time to time in hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business 
if we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting new high quality employees  our business could be materially adversely affected

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the goodyear tire rubber company is one of the world s leading manufacturers of tires  with one of the most recognizable brand names in the world and operations in most regions of the world 
we have a broad global footprint with manufacturing facilities in countries  including the united states 
we operate our business through four operating segments representing our regional tire businesses north american tire  europe  middle east and africa tire emea  latin american tire  and asia pacific tire 
we faced an uncertain business environment in as the global economy continued its recovery from the recessionary economic conditions that existed in many parts of the world during and  particularly in north america and europe 
we also faced a number of substantial challenges  such as rapidly rising raw material and energy costs  wage inflation in emerging markets  continued pressure from our unfunded pension obligations  and the devaluation of the currency and economic weakness in venezuela 
global tire industry demand  while improving  continues to be below pre recessionary levels in north america and remains hard to predict  especially for oe production 
for the year ended december   goodyear net loss was million  compared to a goodyear net loss of million in our total segment operating income for was million  compared to million in the increase in segment operating income was due primarily to a significant decrease in under absorbed fixed overhead costs  an increase in tire volume and strong price and product mix which more than offset raw material costs 
see results of operations segment information for additional information 
net sales were billion in  compared to billion in net sales increased due to higher tire volume  primarily in north american tire and emea  an increase in other tire related businesses  primarily in north american tire s third party sales of chemical products  and improved product mix 
we acted to address the uncertain economic environment and the challenges described above by implementing strategic initiatives aimed at permitting us to take advantage of improving economic conditions and to emerge stronger in the future 
under those strategic initiatives we planned to continue to focus on consumer driven product development by launching a significant number of new and innovative products  take a selective approach to the market  targeting profitable segments where we have competitive advantage  focus on price and product mix improvements to address rising raw material costs  achieve cost reductions of billion over three years from to  reduce our high cost capacity by to million units  focus on cash flow to provide funding for investments in future growth  create an advantaged supply chain focused on optimizing inventory levels and further improving customer service  and improve our manufacturing efficiency  including recovering unabsorbed fixed costs incurred during the recession 
we met  and frequently exceeded  our financial and operating goals for  including the following key achievements nearly successful new product launches thereby increasing the percentage of our sales coming from recently launched products  
table of contents price and product mix improvements of million  which helped to offset million of raw material cost increases  exclusive of approximately million of raw material cost savings included in our cost savings described below  cost savings of million  which included savings from continuous improvement initiatives  including savings under our usw agreement  increased low cost country sourcing  and initiatives to reduce raw material costs and selling  administrative and general expense  recovery of unabsorbed fixed costs of approximately million compared to  continued progress on actions to reduce our high cost manufacturing capacity  including the announced closure of our factory in union city  tennessee  which brings our announced manufacturing capacity reductions to approximately million units and will achieve our goal of reducing high cost capacity by to million units  significant progress on manufacturing investments in oklahoma  chile and china  further improvements in working capital through strong inventory management  improved vendor terms and good collections at year end  and the successful completion of a billion debt offering in august that addressed our debt maturities and further enhanced our liquidity position 
pension and benefit plans during  our us pension fund experienced market gains  which increased plan assets by million and decreased net actuarial losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl by million 
as a result  annual us net periodic pension cost will decrease to approximately million to million in from million in  due primarily to expected returns on higher plan assets 
liquidity at december   we had  million in cash and cash equivalents as well as  million of unused availability under our various credit agreements  compared to  million and  million  respectively  at december  cash and cash equivalents were favorably affected by the reduced net loss compared to  improvements in trade working capital of million and proceeds from the issuance of our billion senior notes due partially offsetting these increases in cash and cash equivalents were capital expenditures of million and the redemption of million of outstanding notes  including million of notes due in and million of notes due in we believe that our liquidity position is adequate to fund our operating and investing needs in and to provide us with flexibility to respond to further changes in the business environment 
new products in  we successfully launched our new goodyear assurance comfortred touring tire in north american tire 
we also announced the launch of new and retread product lines in our commercial truck tire business with seven of those lines featuring fuel max and duraseal technology 
at our north american tire dealer conference in early  we introduced several key products  most notably the goodyear assurance tripletred all season tire and our new eagle f asymmetric tire 
additionally  we are adding key sizes of new consumer products launched in recent years 
in europe  middle east and africa tire  we introduced the dunlop streetresponse and the quatromaxx 
we also introduced the ug ice targeting the nordic and russian markets 
in addition  we launched our goodyear fuel max trailer tires 
in latin american tire  we successfully developed the fuel max technology for consumer through the gps duraplus product line 
we also introduced the eagle excellence with aquamax technology and the viva product line 
the new g plus for city service applications was introduced in the commercial line 

table of contents in asia pacific tire  we launched the eagle efficientgrip and assurance fuel max tires and re launched the wrangler at sa with improved wear performance to meet the demand of the growing suv segment 
outlook we expect to be a year of continued recovery 
we will face challenges related primarily to raw material costs and the significant actions we are taking globally to improve our manufacturing footprint 
we expect the global tire industry to continue to grow in  with volume expansion across all regions and major segments 
in north america  consumer replacement is expected to grow between and  consumer oe between and  commercial replacement between and and commercial oe between and 
we anticipate our north american consumer oe volumes will increase at less than the industry rate  given actions we have taken to be more selective in our oe fitments 
in europe  consumer replacement is expected to grow between and  consumer oe between and  commercial replacement between and and commercial oe between and 
overall  we expect our unit sales will increase by to in as we continue to grow in targeted segments 
we expect our raw material costs in the first quarter of to increase to when compared with the first quarter of similar increases are expected for the second quarter of compared with the second quarter of we expect raw material costs to peak in the third quarter of in order to mitigate some of the impact of rapidly rising natural rubber prices  we are continuing to focus on price and product mix  to substitute synthetic rubber for natural rubber where possible and to work to identify additional substitution opportunities  to reduce the amount of natural rubber required in each tire  and to pursue alternative raw materials including innovative bio based materials 
however  during periods of rapidly rising raw material costs  we may not be able to fully offset those raw material cost increases through the use of these strategies  although we remain confident in our ability to do so over the longer term 
we expect unabsorbed fixed cost recovery and our cost savings program to contribute approximately billion to our operating results in and compared to as a result of increased production and our planned manufacturing footprint reductions in tennessee and france  we expect to recover approximately million of unabsorbed fixed costs in and approximately million in we also expect to reduce costs by more than million in and  with approximately half of the savings realized in each year 
as a partial offset to these benefits  we expect to incur approximately million to million of additional costs related to start up expenses for our new manufacturing facility in china in see item a

interest expense interest expense was million in  increasing million compared to the increase was due primarily to higher weighted average interest rates in partially offset by lower average debt levels 
other expense other expense in was million  increasing million from million in net foreign currency exchange losses in were million compared to million in the period included a first quarter foreign exchange loss of million million after tax or per share resulting from the january  devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar fuerte against the us dollar and a fourth quarter foreign exchange loss of million million after tax or per share in connection with the january  elimination of the two tier exchange rate structure  which was announced by the venezuelan government in december foreign currency exchange also reflected net gains and losses resulting from the effect of exchange rate changes on various foreign currency transactions worldwide 
effective january   venezuela s economy was considered to be highly inflationary under us generally accepted accounting principles since it experienced a rate of general inflation in excess of over the latest three year period  based upon the blended consumer price index and national consumer price index 
accordingly  the us dollar was determined to be the functional currency of our venezuelan subsidiary 
all gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of its financial statements since january  were determined using official exchange rates 
on january   venezuela established a two tier exchange rate structure for essential and non essential goods 
for essential goods the official exchange rate was bolivares fuertes to the us dollar and for non essential goods the official exchange rate was bolivares fuertes to the us dollar 
as announced by the venezuelan government in december  on january   the two tier exchange rate structure was eliminated and the exchange rate for essential goods cannot be used for our unsettled amounts at december  effective january   the official exchange rate of bolivares fuertes to the us dollar was established for substantially all goods 
the million foreign currency exchange loss in the first quarter of primarily consisted of a million remeasurement loss on bolivar denominated net monetary assets and liabilities  including deferred taxes  at the time of the january devaluation 
the loss was primarily related to cash deposits in venezuela that were remeasured at the official exchange rate of bolivares fuertes applicable to non essential goods  and was 
table of contents partially offset by a million subsidy receivable related to us dollar denominated payables that were expected to be settled at the official subsidy exchange rate of bolivares fuertes applicable to essential goods 
since we expected these payables to be settled at the subsidy essential goods rate  we established a subsidy receivable to reflect the expected benefit to be received in the form of the difference between the essential and non essential goods exchange rates 
throughout  we periodically assessed our ability to realize the benefit of the subsidy receivable  and a substantial portion of purchases by our venezuelan subsidiary had qualified and settled at the official exchange rate for essential goods 
as a result of the elimination of the official subsidy exchange rate for essential goods  we no longer expect our venezuelan subsidiary to settle payables at that exchange rate 
accordingly  we recorded a foreign exchange loss of million in the fourth quarter of related to the reversal of the subsidy receivable at december  financing fees in of million included million million after tax or per share related to the redemption of million of long term debt  of which million were cash premiums paid on the redemption and million were financing fees which were written off 
also included in financing fees were costs related to our debt exchange offer of million million after tax or per share 
net gains on asset sales were million million after tax or per share in compared to net losses on asset sales of million million after tax or per share in net gains in related primarily to the sale of a closed manufacturing facility in taiwan and land in thailand and the recognition of a deferred gain from the sale of a warehouse in guatemala in net losses in were due primarily to the sale of certain of our properties in akron  ohio that comprise our current headquarters in connection with the development of a proposed new headquarters in akron  ohio

the difference between our effective tax rate and the us statutory rate was due primarily to our continuing to maintain a full valuation allowance against our net federal and state deferred tax assets and the adjustments discussed above 
our losses in various taxing jurisdictions in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require us to maintain a full valuation allowance against certain of our net deferred tax assets 
however  in certain foreign locations  it is reasonably possible that sufficient positive evidence required to release all  or a portion  of these valuation allowances within the next months will exist  resulting in possible one time tax benefits of up to million million net of minority interest

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes to the financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  management reviews its estimates  based on currently available information 
changes in facts and circumstances may alter such estimates and affect results of operations and financial position in future periods 
our critical accounting policies relate to general and product liability and other litigation  workers compensation  recoverability of goodwill  deferred tax asset valuation allowance and uncertain income tax positions  and pensions and other postretirement benefits 
general and product liability and other litigation 
general and product liability and other recorded litigation liabilities are recorded based on management s assessment that a loss arising from these matters is probable 
if the loss can be reasonably estimated  we record the amount of the estimated loss 
if the loss is estimated within a range and no point within the range is more probable than another  we record the minimum amount in the range 
as 
table of contents additional information becomes available  any potential liability related to these matters is assessed and the estimates are revised  if necessary 
loss ranges are based upon the specific facts of each claim or class of claims and are determined after review by counsel 
court rulings on our cases or similar cases may impact our assessment of the probability and our estimate of the loss  which may have an impact on our reported results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
we record receivables for insurance recoveries related to our litigation claims when it is probable that we will receive reimbursement from the insurer 
specifically  we are a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging various asbestos related personal injuries purported to result from alleged exposure to asbestos in certain rubber encapsulated products or aircraft braking systems manufactured by us in the past  or in certain of our facilities 
typically  these lawsuits have been brought against multiple defendants in federal and state courts 
a significant assumption in our estimated asbestos liability is the period over which the liability can be reasonably estimated 
due to the difficulties in making these estimates  analysis based on new data and or changed circumstances arising in the future may result in an increase in the recorded obligation in an amount that cannot be reasonably estimated  and that increase may be significant 
we had recorded liabilities for both asserted and unasserted asbestos claims  inclusive of defense costs  totaling million at december  the portion of the liability associated with unasserted asbestos claims and related defense costs was million 
at december   we estimate that it is reasonably possible that our gross liabilities  net of our estimate for probable insurance recoveries  could exceed our recorded amounts by approximately million 
we maintain primary insurance coverage under coverage in place agreements as well as excess liability insurance with respect to asbestos liabilities 
we record a receivable with respect to such policies when we determine that recovery is probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of a particular recovery 
this determination is based on consultation with our outside legal counsel and taking into consideration agreements in principle with certain of our insurance carriers  the financial viability and legal obligations of our insurance carriers and other relevant factors 
as of december   i we had recorded a receivable related to asbestos claims of million  and ii we expect that approximately of asbestos claim related losses would be recoverable through insurance through the period covered by the estimated liability 
the receivables recorded consist of an amount we expect to collect under coverage in place agreements with certain primary carriers as well as an amount we believe is probable of recovery from certain of our excess coverage insurance carriers 
of this amount  million was included in current assets as part of accounts receivable at december  workers compensation 
we had recorded liabilities  on a discounted basis  of million for anticipated costs related to us workers compensation claims at december  the costs include an estimate of expected settlements on pending claims  defense costs and a provision for claims incurred but not reported 
these estimates are based on our assessment of potential liability using an analysis of available information with respect to pending claims  historical experience  and current cost trends 
the amount of our ultimate liability in respect of these matters may differ from these estimates 
we periodically  and at least annually  update our loss development factors based on actuarial analyses 
the liability is discounted using the risk free rate of return 
for further information on general and product liability and other litigation  and workers compensation  refer to the note to the consolidated financial statements no 
 commitments and contingent liabilities 
recoverability of goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized 
rather  goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an indicator of impairment is present 
goodwill totaled million at december  we have determined our reporting units to be consistent with our operating segments comprised of four strategic business units north american tire  europe  middle east and africa tire  latin american tire  and asia pacific tire 
goodwill is allocated to these reporting units based on the original purchase price allocation for acquisitions within the various reporting units 
there have been no changes to our reporting units or in the manner in which goodwill was allocated in our annual impairment testing is conducted as of july st each year and for our analysis indicated no impairment of goodwill 
for purposes of our annual testing in  we determined the estimated fair values using a discounted cash flow approach 
we believe this methodology is appropriate in the determination of fair value 
we 
table of contents may also use different fair value techniques when we believe a discounted cash flow approach may not provide an appropriate determination of fair value 
the discounted cash flow model of the reporting units is based on the forecasted operating cash flow for the current year  projected operating cash flows for the next nine years determined using forecasted amounts as well as an estimated growth rate and a terminal value beyond ten years 
discounted cash flows consist of the operating cash flows for each business unit less an estimate for capital expenditures 
the key assumptions incorporated in the discounted cash flow approach include growth rates  projected segment operating income  changes in working capital  our plan for capital expenditures  anticipated funding for pensions  and a discount rate equal to our assumed long term cost of capital 
corporate administrative expenses are allocations of corporate overhead that we make to each strategic business unit and are excluded from the discounted cash flow model 
cash flows may be adjusted to exclude certain non recurring or unusual items 
as segment operating income was the starting point for determining operating cash flow  which excludes non recurring or unusual items  there were no other non recurring or unusual items excluded from the calculations of operating cash flow in any of the periods included in our determination of fair value 
we consider significant decreases in forecasted cash flows in future periods to be an indication of a potential impairment 
at the time of our annual impairment testing  fair value would have to decline in excess of for north american tire  over for emea and over for asia pacific tire to reduce fair value below carrying value 
the discount rate used would have to increase over two percentage points for north american tire  over seven percentage points for emea and over two percentage points for asia pacific tire or the assumed growth rate would have to be negative for each of the business units to indicate a potential impairment 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance and uncertain income tax positions 
at december   we had a valuation allowance aggregating billion against all of our net federal and state and certain of our foreign net deferred tax assets 
we assess both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
evidence  such as operating results during the most recent three year period  is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability  which are inherently uncertain 
our losses in the us and certain foreign locations in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against our net federal  state and certain of our foreign deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the realization of such assets 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we also recognize tax benefits to the extent that it is more likely than not that our positions will be sustained when challenged by the taxing authorities 
we derecognize tax benefits when based on new information we determine that it is no longer more likely than not that our position will be sustained 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established  or determine we need to derecognize tax benefits recorded in prior periods  or that we are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities  our effective tax rate in a given period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash  and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution 
we report interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income taxes 
for additional information regarding uncertain income tax positions  refer to the note to the consolidated financial statements no

pensions and other postretirement benefits 
our recorded liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits are based on a number of assumptions  including life expectancies  retirement rates  discount rates  
table of contents long term rates of return on plan assets  future compensation levels  future health care costs  and maximum company covered benefit costs 
certain of these assumptions are determined with the assistance of independent actuaries 
assumptions about life expectancies  retirement rates  future compensation levels and future health care costs are based on past experience and anticipated future trends  including an assumption about inflation 
the discount rate for our us plans is based on a yield curve derived from a portfolio of corporate bonds from issuers rated aa or higher as of december and is reviewed annually 
our expected benefit payment cash flows are discounted based on spot rates developed from the yield curve 
the long term rate of return on plan assets is based on the compound annualized return of our us pension fund over a period of years or more  estimates of future long term rates of return on assets similar to the target allocation of our pension fund and long term inflation 
actual us pension fund asset allocations are reviewed on a monthly basis and the pension fund is rebalanced to target ranges on an as needed basis 
these assumptions are reviewed regularly and revised when appropriate 
changes in one or more of them may affect the amount of our recorded liabilities and net periodic costs for these benefits 
other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age  mortality and turnover are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our experience and expectations for the future 
if the actual experience differs from expectations  our financial position  results of operations and liquidity in future periods may be affected 
the weighted average discount rate used in estimating the total liability for our us pension and other postretirement benefit plans was and  respectively  at december   compared to and for our us pension and other postretirement benefit plans  respectively  at december  the decrease in the discount rate at december  was due primarily to lower interest rate yields on highly rated corporate bonds

liquidity and capital resources overview our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating and financing activities 
our cash flows from operating activities are driven primarily by our operating results and changes in our working capital requirements and our cash flows from financing activities are dependent upon our ability to access credit or other capital 
we faced an uncertain business environment in as the global economy continued its recovery from the recessionary economic conditions that existed in many parts of the world during and  particularly in north america and europe 
we also faced a number of substantial challenges  such as rapidly rising raw material and energy costs  wage inflation in emerging markets  continued pressure from our unfunded pension obligations  and the devaluation of the currency and economic weakness in venezuela 
global tire industry demand  while improving  continues to be below pre recessionary levels in north america and remains hard to predict  especially for oe production 
given the uncertain economic environment  in we remained focused on cash flow in order to provide funding for investments in future growth  and took several actions to strengthen our liquidity  including further improvements in working capital through strong inventory management  improved vendor terms and good collections at year end  and the successful completion of a billion debt offering in august that addressed our debt maturities 
for further information on the other strategic initiatives we pursued in  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 
at december   we had  million in cash and cash equivalents  compared to  million at december  cash and cash equivalents were favorably affected by the reduced net loss compared to  improvements in trade working capital of million and proceeds from the issuance of our billion senior notes due partially offsetting these increases in cash and cash equivalents were capital expenditures of million and the redemption of million of outstanding notes  including million of notes due in and million of notes due in 
table of contents at december  and  we had  million and  million  respectively  of unused availability under our various credit agreements 
the table below provides unused availability by our significant credit facilities as of december in millions billion first lien revolving credit facility due million revolving credit facility due china financing agreements other us and international debt notes payable and overdrafts at december   our unused availability included million which can only be used to finance the relocation and expansion of our manufacturing facilities in china 
these credit facilities  along with government grants  should provide funding for most of the cost related to the relocation and expansion of these manufacturing facilities 
there were million of borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities at december  we have deposited our cash and cash equivalents and entered into various credit agreements and derivative contracts with financial institutions that we considered to be substantial and creditworthy at the time of such transactions 
we seek to control our exposure to these financial institutions by diversifying our deposits  credit agreements and derivative contracts across multiple financial institutions  by setting deposit and counterparty credit limits based on long term credit ratings and other indicators of credit risk such as credit default swap spreads  and by monitoring the financial strength of these financial institutions on a regular basis 
we also enter into master netting agreements with counterparties when possible 
by controlling and monitoring exposure to financial institutions in this manner  we believe that we effectively manage the risk of loss due to nonperformance by a financial institution 
however  we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience losses or delays in accessing our deposits or lines of credit due to the nonperformance of a financial institution 
our inability to access our cash deposits or make draws on our lines of credit  or the inability of a counterparty to fulfill its contractual obligations to us  could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial position or results of operations in the period in which it occurs 
in  we expect our operating needs to include global contributions to our funded pension plans of approximately million to million and our investing needs to include capital expenditures of approximately billion to billion 
we also expect interest expense to range between million and million 
the strategic initiatives described above are intended to permit us to operate the business in a way that allows us to address these needs with our existing cash and available credit if they cannot be funded by cash generated from operations 
if market opportunities exist  we may choose to undertake additional financing actions in order to further enhance our liquidity position which could include obtaining new bank debt or capital markets transactions 
in march  we completed an offer to exchange our outstanding notes due for a new series of notes due a total of million in aggregate principal amount of the notes due were validly tendered  and million in aggregate principal amount of the notes due were issued in the exchange 
in august  we issued billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes due we used the net proceeds from the offerings of those notes  together with available cash  to redeem million aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes on september   including million of notes due in and million of notes due in as a result of these transactions  we have paid off all of our material debt maturities due in on june   the preservation of access to care for medicare beneficiaries and pension relief act of the pension relief act was signed into law 
the pension relief act provides funding relief for defined benefit pension plan sponsors by deferring near term contributions 
as allowed by the pension relief act  we elected funding relief for the plan year and expect to elect funding relief for the plan year  which is expected to reduce our total us pension contributions in to by approximately million to million 
we currently estimate that we will be required to make contributions to our funded us pension plans 
table of contents of approximately million to million in the reduction from funding relief will result in increased contributions in years after sri has certain minority exit rights that  if triggered and exercised  could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire sri s interests in gdte and gdtna following the determination of the fair value of sri s interests 
for further information regarding our global alliance with sri  including the events that could trigger sri s exit rights  see item business 
description of goodyear s business global alliance 
as of the date of this filing  sri has not provided us notice of any exit rights that have become exercisable 
our ability to service debt and operational requirements is also dependent  in part  on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions of cash to various other entities in our consolidated group  whether in the form of dividends  loans or otherwise 
in certain countries where we operate  such as venezuela  transfers of funds into or out of such countries by way of dividends  loans  advances or payments to third party or affiliated suppliers are generally or periodically subject to certain requirements  such as obtaining approval from the foreign government and or currency exchange board before net assets can be transferred out of the country 
in addition  certain of our credit agreements and other debt instruments limit the ability of foreign subsidiaries to make distributions of cash 
thus  we would have to repay and or amend these credit agreements and other debt instruments in order to use this cash to service our consolidated debt 
because of the inherent uncertainty of satisfactorily meeting these requirements or limitations  we do not consider the net assets of our subsidiaries  including our venezuelan subsidiary  that are subject to such requirements or limitations to be integral to our liquidity or our ability to service our debt and operational requirements 
at december   approximately million of net assets were subject to such restrictions 
effective january   venezuela s economy was considered to be highly inflationary under us generally accepted accounting principles since it experienced a rate of general inflation in excess of over the latest three year period  based upon the blended consumer price index and national consumer price index 
accordingly  the us dollar was determined to be the functional currency of our venezuelan subsidiary 
all gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of its financial statements since january  were determined using official exchange rates and are reported in other expense 
on january   venezuela established a two tier exchange rate structure for essential and non essential goods 
for essential goods the official exchange rate was bolivares fuertes to the us dollar and for non essential goods the official exchange rate was bolivares fuertes to the us dollar 
as announced by the venezuelan government in december  on january   the two tier exchange rate structure was eliminated and the official exchange rate for essential goods cannot be used for our unsettled amounts at december  effective january   the official exchange rate of bolivares fuertes to the us dollar was established for substantially all goods 
the million foreign currency exchange loss in the first quarter of primarily consisted of a million remeasurement loss on bolivar denominated net monetary assets and liabilities  including deferred taxes  at the time of the january devaluation 
the loss was primarily related to cash deposits in venezuela that were remeasured at the official exchange rate of bolivares fuertes applicable to non essential goods  and was partially offset by a million subsidy receivable related to us dollar denominated payables that were expected to be settled at the official subsidy exchange rate of bolivares fuertes applicable to essential goods 
since we expected these payables to be settled at the subsidy essential goods rate  we established a subsidy receivable to reflect the expected benefit to be received in the form of the difference between the essential and non essential goods exchange rates 
throughout  we periodically assessed our ability to realize the benefit of the subsidy receivable  and a substantial portion of purchases by our venezuelan subsidiary had qualified and settled at the official exchange rate for essential goods 
as a result of the elimination of the official subsidy exchange rate for essential goods  we no longer expect our venezuelan subsidiary to settle payables at that exchange rate 
accordingly  we recorded a foreign exchange loss of million in the fourth quarter of related to the reversal of the subsidy receivable at december  if in the future we convert bolivares fuertes at a rate other than the official exchange rate or the official exchange rate is revised  we may realize additional losses that would be recorded in the statement of operations 
at 
table of contents december   we had bolivar fuerte denominated monetary assets of million which consisted primarily of million of cash  million of deferred tax assets and million of accounts receivable  and bolivar fuerte denominated monetary liabilities of million which consisted primarily of million of intercompany payables  million of accounts payable trade and million of compensation and benefits 
at december   we had bolivar fuerte denominated monetary assets of million which consisted primarily of million of cash  million of deferred tax assets and million of accounts receivable  and bolivar fuerte denominated monetary liabilities of million which consisted primarily of million of income taxes payable  million of accounts payable trade  and million of compensation and benefits 
all monetary assets and liabilities were remeasured at bolivares fuertes to the us dollar at december   and were translated at bolivares fuertes to the us dollar at december  goodyear venezuela s sales were and of our net sales for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
goodyear venezuela s operating income was and of our segment operating income for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
the percentage for the twelve months ended december  was high due to the operating loss in in north american tire 
goodyear venezuela s sales are bolivar fuerte denominated and cost of goods sold are approximately bolivar fuerte denominated and approximately us dollar denominated 
a further decrease in the bolivar fuerte against the us dollar would decrease goodyear venezuela s sales and increase cost of goods sold by approximately million and approximately million  respectively  on an annual basis 
during  goodyear venezuela settled million and million  respectively  of us dollar denominated intercompany payables and accounts payable trade 
for the twelve month period ended december   approximately of those payables were settled at the essential goods rate of bolivares fuertes to the us dollar 
at december   settlements of us dollar denominated liabilities pending before the currency exchange board were million 
at december   million of the requested settlements were pending up to days  million were pending from to days and million were pending over one year 
amounts pending from to days include dividends payable of million and amounts pending over one year include imported tires of million  intercompany charges for royalties of million and dividends payable of million 
currency exchange controls in venezuela continue to limit our ability to remit funds from venezuela 
goodyear venezuela contributed a significant portion of latin american tire s sales and operating income in and the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar fuerte against the us dollar in january and weak economic conditions and operational disruptions in venezuela adversely impacted latin american tire s operating income by approximately million as compared to additionally  we recorded million in charges related to the devaluation of the bolivar fuerte in in other expense 
the operational challenges we face include high absenteeism  a lack of supplies and difficulties importing raw materials and finished goods 
in response to the devaluation and conditions in venezuela  we continue to evaluate the need to adjust prices for our products while remaining competitive and have taken steps to address our operational challenges  including securing necessary approvals for import licenses and increasing the local production of certain tires 
our pricing policies take into account factors such as fluctuations in raw material cost  production cost  market demand and adherence to government price controls 
as a result  the elimination of the two tier exchange rate structure is not expected to have a significant impact on latin american tire s sales and operating income in compared to for a discussion of the risks related to our international operations  including venezuela  see item a 
risk factors 
we believe that our liquidity position is adequate to fund our operating and investing needs and debt maturities in and to provide us with flexibility to respond to further changes in the business environment 
if market opportunities exist  we may choose to undertake additional financing actions in order to further enhance our liquidity position which could include obtaining new bank debt or capital markets transactions 
however  the challenges of the present business environment may cause a material reduction in our liquidity as a result of an adverse change in our cash flow from operations or our access to credit or other capital

these covenants are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications 
we have additional financial covenants in our first lien revolving and second lien credit facilities that are currently not applicable

our credit facilities and indentures also permit the incurrence of additional debt through other provisions in those agreements without regard to our ability to satisfy the ratio based incurrence test described above

potential future financings in addition to our previous financing activities  we may seek to undertake additional financing actions which could include restructuring bank debt or capital markets transactions  possibly including the issuance of additional debt or equity 
given the challenges that we face and the uncertainties of the market conditions  access to the capital markets cannot be assured 
our future liquidity requirements may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt 
however  a substantial portion of our assets are already subject to liens securing our indebtedness 
as a result  we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness 
in addition  no assurance can be given as to our ability to raise additional unsecured debt 
dividends under our primary credit facilities we are permitted to pay dividends on our common stock as long as no default will have occurred and be continuing  additional indebtedness can be incurred under the credit facilities following the payment  and certain financial tests are satisfied

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we utilize derivative financial instrument contracts and nonderivative instruments to manage interest rate  foreign exchange and commodity price risks 
we have established a control environment that includes policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval  reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
commodity price risk the raw materials costs to which our operations are principally exposed include the cost of natural rubber  synthetic rubber  carbon black  fabrics  steel cord and other petrochemical based commodities 
approximately two thirds of our raw materials are oil based derivatives  whose cost may be affected by fluctuations in the price of oil 
we currently do not hedge commodity prices 
we do  however  use various strategies to partially offset cost increases for raw materials  including centralizing purchases of raw materials through our global procurement organization in an effort to leverage our purchasing power  expanding our capabilities to substitute lower cost raw materials and reducing the amount of natural rubber required in each tire 
interest rate risk we continuously monitor our fixed and floating rate debt mix 
within defined limitations  we manage the mix using refinancing 
at december   of our debt was at variable interest rates averaging compared to at an average rate of at december  
table of contents the following table presents information about long term fixed rate debt  excluding capital leases  at december in millions carrying amount liability fair value liability pro forma fair value liability the pro forma information assumes a basis point decrease in market interest rates at december of each year  and reflects the estimated fair value of fixed rate debt outstanding at that date under that assumption 
the sensitivity of our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates was determined using current market pricing models 
foreign currency exchange risk we enter into foreign currency contracts in order to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency denominated cash flows 
these contracts reduce exposure to currency movements affecting existing foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  firm commitments and forecasted transactions resulting primarily from trade receivables and payables  equipment acquisitions  intercompany loans and royalty agreements  and forecasted purchases and sales 
contracts hedging short term trade receivables and payables normally have no hedging designation 
the following table presents foreign currency derivative information at december in millions fair value asset liability pro forma decrease in fair value contract maturities the pro forma decrease in fair value assumes a adverse change in underlying foreign exchange rates at december of each year  and reflects the estimated change in the fair value of positions outstanding at that date under that assumption
