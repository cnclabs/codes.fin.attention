item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a global leader in distributed enterprise networks that securely connect local and remote users to corporate it resources 
our award winning portfolio of campus  branch office  teleworker  and mobile solutions simplify operations and provide secure access to all corporate applications and services regardless of a user s device  location  or network 
the result is improved productivity and lower capital and operating costs 
our product portfolio encompasses industry leading high speed a b g n wlans  virtual branching networking solutions for branch offices and teleworkers  network operations tools  including spectrum analyzers  wireless intrusion prevention systems  and the airwave wireless management suite for managing wired  wireless  and mobile device networks 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we introduced our new move architecture 
our move architecture integrates wireless  wired and remote silos into one cohesive access solution enabled by cloud based mobility services 
access privileges are context aware  meaning they are based on user  device  application and location  and this dictates the type of network resources each person is entitled to access 
these products are key to our network rightsizing initiative which allows companies to move toward a low cost it infrastructure solution by funding wireless projects rather than wired lans 
our products have been sold to over  end customers worldwide not including customers of alcatel lucent  including some of the largest and most complex global organizations 
we have implemented a two tier distribution model in most areas of the world  including the united states  with vads selling our portfolio of products  including a variety of our support services  to a diverse number of vars 
our focus continues to be management of our channel including selection and growth of high prospect partners  activation of our vars and vads through active training and field collaboration  and evolution of our channel programs in consultation with our partners 

table of contents major trends affecting our financial results worldwide economic conditions our business depends on the overall demand for it and on the economic health and general willingness of our current and prospective customers to make capital commitments 
if the conditions in the us and global economic environment remain uncertain or continue to be volatile  or if they deteriorate further  our business  operating results  and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
economic weakness  customer financial difficulties and constrained spending on it initiatives have resulted  and may in the future result  in challenging and delayed sales cycles and could negatively impact our ability to forecast future periods 
in particular  we cannot be assured of the level of it spending  the deterioration of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and growth rates 
revenues our ability to increase our product revenues will depend significantly on continued growth in the market for enterprise mobility and remote networking solutions  continued acceptance of our products in the marketplace  our ability to continue to attract new customers  our ability to compete  the willingness of customers to displace wired networks with wireless lans  in particular  wireless lans that utilize our n solution  and our ability to continue to sell into our installed base of existing customers 
our growth in support revenues is dependent upon increasing the number of products under support contracts  which is dependent on both growing our installed base of customers and renewing existing support contracts 
our future profitability and rate of growth  if any  will also be directly affected by the timing and size of orders  product and channel mix  average selling prices  costs of our products  our ability to effectively implement and generate incremental business from our two tier distribution model  general economic conditions  and the extent to which we invest in our sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative resources 
the revenue growth that we have experienced has been driven primarily by an expansion of our customer base coupled with increased purchases from existing customers 
we believe the growth we have experienced is the result of business enterprises needing to provide secure mobility to their users in a manner that we believe is more cost effective than the traditional approach of using port centric networks 
while we have experienced both longer sales cycles and seasonality  both of which have slowed our revenue growth  we believe that our product offerings  in particular our products that incorporate n wireless lan standard technologies  will enable broader networking initiatives by both our current and potential customers in the future 
each quarter  our ability to meet our product revenue expectations is dependent upon new orders received  shipped  and recognized in a given quarter  the amount of orders booked but not shipped in the prior quarter that are shipped in the current quarter  and the amount of deferred revenue entering a given quarter 
our product deferred revenue is comprised of product orders that have shipped but where the terms of the agreement  typically with our large customers  contain acceptance terms and conditions or other terms that require that the revenue be deferred until all revenue recognition criteria are met  and product orders shipped to our vads and oems for which we have not yet received persuasive evidence from the vads or oems of a sale to an end customer 
we typically ship products within a reasonable time period after the receipt of an order 
costs and expenses operating expenses consist of research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses 
the largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs 
personnel costs consist of salaries  benefits and incentive compensation for our employees  including commissions for sales personnel and stock based compensation for all employees 
personnel related costs are the most significant component of each these categories 
our total headcount increased to  at july  from  at april   at january   at october  and at july  the increase in employees is the most significant driver behind the increase in costs and operating expenses in fiscal going forward  we expect to continue to hire employees throughout the company 

table of contents acquisitions on november   we entered into an agreement with amigopod  pursuant to which we acquired substantially all of its assets 
the acquisition was completed on december  the total consideration was million and resulted in additional goodwill of million 
on september   we completed our acquisition of azalea networks for a total purchase price of million which included common stock  cash  and contingent rights 
azalea is a leading supplier of outdoor mesh networks and includes an operations center in beijing  china that will complement our existing research and development centers 
as part of the acquisition  we recorded million of tangible assets  million of intangible assets and million of goodwill 
we recorded a liability for the estimated fair value of the contingent rights which was based on significant inputs not observed in the market and thus represents a level instrument 
level instruments are valued based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and reflect our own assumptions in measuring fair value 
gains and losses on the remeasurement of the liability are included in other income expense  net 
see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenues  cost of revenues and operating expenses revenues we derive our revenues from sales of our arubaos operating system  controllers  wired and wireless access points  switches  application software modules  multi vendor management solution software  and professional services and support 
professional services revenues consist of consulting and training services 
consulting services primarily consist of installation support services 
training services are instructor led courses on the use of our products 
support services typically consist of software updates  on a when and if available basis  telephone and internet access to technical support personnel and hardware support 
we provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades and to maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period 
we sell our products directly through our sales force and indirectly through vads  vars  and oems 
we expect revenues from indirect channels to continue to constitute a significant majority of our future revenues 
we sell our products to channel partners and end customers located in the americas  europe  the middle east  africa and asia pacific 
we continue to expand into international locations and introduce our products in new markets  and we expect international revenues to increase in absolute dollars and remain consistent or increase as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal for more information about our international revenues  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
cost of revenues cost of product revenues consists primarily of manufacturing costs for our products  shipping and logistics costs  and expenses for inventory obsolescence and warranty obligations 
we utilize third parties to manufacture our products and perform shipping logistics 
we have outsourced the substantial majority of our manufacturing  repair and supply chain operations 
accordingly  the substantial majority of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our contract manufacturers 
our contractor manufacturers produce our products in china and singapore using quality assurance programs and standards that we jointly established 
manufacturing  engineering and documentation controls are conducted at our facilities in sunnyvale  california  bangalore  india and beijing  china 
cost of product revenues also includes amortization expense from our purchased intangible assets 
cost of professional services and support revenues is primarily comprised of personnel costs  including stock based compensation  of providing technical support  including personnel costs associated with our internal support organization 
in addition  we engage a third party support vendor to complement our internal support resources  the costs of which are included within costs of professional services and support revenues 

table of contents gross margin our gross margin has been  and will continue to be  affected by a variety of factors  including the proportion of our products that are sold through direct versus indirect channels  product mix and average selling prices  new product introductions  such as our move architecture and our outdoor mesh network products  and product enhancements made by us as well as those made by our competitors  pressure to discount our products in response to our competitor s discounting practices  mix of revenue attributed to our international regions  demand for our products and services  our ability to attain volume manufacturing pricing from our contract manufacturers and our component suppliers  losses associated with excess and obsolete inventory  growth in our headcount and other related costs incurred in our customer support organization  costs associated with manufacturing overhead  our ability to manage freight costs  and amortization expense from our purchased intangible assets 
due to higher net effective discounts for products sold through our indirect channel  our overall gross margins for indirect channel sales are typically lower than those associated with direct sales 
we expect product revenues from our indirect channel to continue to constitute a significant majority of our total revenues  which  by itself  negatively impacts our gross margins 
further  we expect that within our indirect channel  sales through our vads and oems will continue to be significant  which will negatively impact our gross margins as vads and oems experience a larger net effective discount than our other channel partners 
research and development expenses research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel costs and facilities costs 
we expense research and development expenses as incurred 
we are devoting substantial resources to the continued development of additional functionality for existing products and the development of new products 
we intend to continue to invest significantly in our research and development efforts because we believe it is essential to maintaining our competitive position 
for fiscal  we expect research and development expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis and decrease as a percentage of revenue compared to fiscal sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses represent the largest component of our operating expenses and primarily consist of personnel costs  sales commissions  marketing programs and facilities costs 
amortization expense related to our purchased intangible assets is also included in sales and marketing expenses 
marketing programs are intended to generate revenue from new and existing customers and are expensed as incurred 
we plan to continue to invest strategically in sales and marketing with the intent to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base  expand our domestic and international sales and marketing activities  build brand awareness and sponsor additional marketing events 
we expect future sales and marketing expenses to continue to be our most significant operating expense 
generally  sales personnel are not immediately productive  and thus  the increase in sales and marketing expenses that we experience as we hire additional sales personnel is not expected to immediately result in increased revenues 
as a result  these expenses will reduce our operating margins until such sales personnel become productive and generate revenue 
accordingly  the timing of sales personnel hiring and the rate at which they become productive will affect our future performance 
for fiscal  we expect sales and 
table of contents marketing expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis and decrease as a percentage of revenue compared to fiscal general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel and facilities costs related to our executive  finance  human resource  information technology and legal organizations  as well as insurance  investor relations  and it infrastructure costs related to our enterprise resource planning erp system 
further  our general and administrative expenses include professional services consisting of outside legal  audit  sarbanes oxley and it consulting costs 
we have incurred in the past  and may continue to incur  significant legal costs defending ourselves against claims made by third parties 
these expenses are expected to continue as part of our ongoing operations and depending on the timing and outcome of lawsuits and the legal process  could have a significant impact on our financial statements 
for fiscal  we expect general and administrative expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis and decrease as a percentage of revenue compared to fiscal other income expense  net other income expense  net includes interest income on cash balances  accretion of discount or amortization of premium on short term investments  losses or gains on remeasurement of non us dollar transactions into us dollars  and in connection with our acquisition of azalea in september  changes in the fair value of our contingent rights liability 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates and judgments are made 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our consolidated financial statements will be affected 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates and judgments and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include revenue recognition  stock based compensation  inventory valuation  allowances for doubtful accounts  income taxes  and goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
revenue recognition and sales returns in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition to remove tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality from the scope of industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
in october  the fasb also amended the accounting standards for multiple element revenue arrangements to i provide updated guidance on how the elements in a multiple element arrangement should be separated  and how the consideration should be allocated  ii require an entity to allocate revenue amongst the elements in an arrangement using estimated selling price if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the selling price or third party evidence of the selling price  and iii eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
we adopted this accounting guidance at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal on a prospective basis for applicable arrangements originating or materially modified after july  the impact of this adoption was not material to our financial position and results of operations for fiscal 
table of contents this guidance does not generally change the units of accounting for our revenue transactions 
most non software products and services qualify as separate units of accounting because they have value to the customer on a stand alone basis and our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to delivered products 
the majority of our products are hardware appliances containing software components that function together to provide the essential functionality of the product 
therefore  our hardware appliances are considered non software elements and are not subject to the industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
our product revenue also includes revenue from the sale of stand alone software products 
stand alone software products may operate on our hardware appliance but are not considered essential to the functionality of the hardware 
sales of stand alone software generally include a perpetual license to our software 
sales of stand alone software continue to be subject to the industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
for all arrangements originating or materially modified after july   we recognize revenue in accordance with the amended accounting guidance 
certain arrangements with multiple elements may continue to have stand alone software elements that are subject to the existing software revenue recognition guidance along with non software elements that are subject to the amended revenue accounting guidance 
the revenue for these multiple deliverable arrangements is allocated to the stand alone software elements as a group and the non software elements based on the relative selling prices of all of the elements in the arrangement using the fair value hierarchy in the amended revenue accounting guidance 
for sales of stand alone software after july  and for all transactions entered into prior to the first quarter of  we recognize revenue based on software revenue recognition guidance 
under the software revenue recognition guidance  we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a product agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vsoe of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
in the majority of our contracts  the only element that remains undelivered at the time of delivery of the product is support services 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the contract fee is recognized as product revenue 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  all revenue is generally deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
when the undelivered element for which we do not have vsoe of fair value is support  revenue for the entire arrangement is bundled and recognized ratably over the support period 
vsoe for elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those services when sold separately  and vsoe for support services is measured by the stand alone renewal rate offered to the customer 
in determining vsoe  we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for an element falls within a reasonably narrow pricing range  generally evidenced by a substantial majority of such historical stand alone transactions falling within a reasonably narrow range of the median rates 
in addition  we consider major service groups  geographies  customer classifications  and other variables in determining vsoe 
we are typically not able to determine third party evidence tpe for our products or services 
tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar elements when sold separately 
generally  our go to market strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained 
furthermore  we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products selling prices are on a stand alone basis 
when we are unable to establish selling price of our non software elements using vsoe or tpe  we use estimated selling price esp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 
we determine esp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  cost of products  gross margin objectives  pricing practices  geographies  customer classes and distribution channels 
we regularly review vsoe and esp and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates 
there was not a material impact during fiscal  nor do we currently expect a material impact in the near term from changes in vsoe or esp 

table of contents product revenue consists of revenue from sales of our hardware appliances and perpetual software licenses 
we recognize product revenue when all of the following have occurred we have entered into a legally binding arrangement with a customer  delivery has occurred  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies and significant uncertainties  and collection is reasonably assured 
for sales to direct end users and channel partners  including vars  vads  and oems  we recognize product revenue upon delivery  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
for our hardware appliances  delivery occurs upon transfer of title and risk of loss  which is generally upon shipment 
it is our practice to identify an end user prior to shipment to a channel partner 
for end users and channel partners  we generally have no significant obligations for future performance such as rights of return or pricing credits 
a portion of our sales are made through distributors under agreements allowing for stocking of our products in their inventory  pricing credits and limited rights of return for stock rotation 
product revenue on sales made through these distributors is initially deferred and revenue is recognized upon sell through as reported by the distributors to us 
shipping charges billed to customers are included in product revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of product revenue 
the amount of inventory held by resellers pending a sale to an end customer was million and million as of july  and support and services offerings consist of support agreements  professional services  and training 
support services include repair and replacement of defective hardware appliances  software updates and access to technical support personnel 
software updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades and to maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period 
revenue for support services is recognized on a straight line basis over the service contract term  which is typically one to five years 
revenue for professional services is recognized upon delivery or completion of performance 
professional service arrangements are typically short term in nature and are largely completed within days from the start of service 
revenue for training services is recognized upon delivery of the training 
the related sale of support services to a reseller occurs when a specific sale to an end customer occurs 
if the sale of support services occurs at the same time as we receive the initial purchase order from the reseller  the support services are included on that purchase order and the related revenue is recognized ratably over the related support period  commencing on the date of delivery to the end customer 
if the sale of support services occurs after we receive the initial purchase order  the support services for the specific product sales are purchased on a subsequent purchase order 
the subsequent purchase order is received at the time the point of sale pos report is provided for all product sales that occurred during the month 
revenue for support services is recognized ratably over the related support period  commencing from the delivery date to each respective end customer 
post contractual support pcs services that we provide to our channel partners differ from pcs that we provide to our end customers in that we are only obligated to provide support services to the channel partner directly  while the channel partner is obligated to provide support services directly to the end customer 
the channel partner is obligated to provide level and level support services to the end customer  including technical support and return merchandise authorization rma fulfillment  while our obligations are only to provide software upgrades and level technical support in the unusual scenario in which the channel partner is unable to provide the technical support that the end customer requires 
our fees are typically considered to be fixed or determinable at the inception of an arrangement  generally based on specific products and quantities to be delivered 
substantially all of our contracts do not include rights of return or acceptance provisions 
to the extent that our agreements contain such terms  we recognize revenue once the customer has accepted or once the acceptance provisions or right of return lapses 
payment terms to customers generally range from net to days 
in the event payment terms are provided that differ from our standard business practices  the fees are deemed to not be fixed or determinable and revenue is recognized when the payments become due  provided the remaining criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
we assess the ability to collect from our customers based on a number of factors  including credit worthiness of the customer and past transaction history of the customer 
if the customer is not deemed credit worthy  we defer revenue from the arrangement until payment is received and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we record estimated sales returns as a reduction to revenues upon shipment based on our contractual obligations and 
table of contents historical returns experience 
in cases where we are aware of circumstances that will likely result in a specific customer s request to return purchased equipment  we record a specific sales returns reserve 
stock based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and non employees based on estimated fair values 
our share based payment awards include stock options  restricted stock units and awards  employee stock purchase plan awards and performance based awards  which require an assessment of the probability of vesting 
we calculate the fair value of restricted stock based on the fair market value on the date of grant 
we calculate the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plans on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing method 
this methodology requires the use of subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rates and expected dividends 
this fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
we determine the amount of stock based compensation expense based on awards that we ultimately expect to vest  reduced for estimated forfeitures 
in addition  compensation expense includes the effects of awards modified  repurchased or cancelled 
goodwill and intangibles we perform an annual goodwill impairment test 
for purposes of impairment testing  we have determined that we have only one reporting unit 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of the company 
these estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which primarily includes our market capitalization 
as of the date of the assessment  our market capitalization was substantially in excess of our carrying value 
as a result  we did not recognize impairment charges in any of the periods presented 
purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets  which range from one to seven years 
amortization expense is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in cost of revenues and sales and marketing expenses 
long lived assets  including intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to estimated results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
determination of recoverability of purchased intangible assets is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset 
we did not recognize impairment charges in any of the periods presented 
screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred  including market conditions  operating fundamentals  competition and general economic conditions  requires significant judgment 
additionally  changes in the technology industry occur frequently and quickly 
therefore  there can be no assurance that a charge to operating expenses will not occur as a result of future goodwill and purchased intangible impairment tests 
inventory valuation inventory consists of hardware and related component parts and is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is computed using the standard cost  which approximates actual cost  on a first in  first out basis 
we record inventory write downs for potentially excess inventory based on forecasted demand  economic trends  technological obsolescence of our products and transition of inventory related to new product releases 
if future demand or market 
table of contents conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs could be required and would be reflected in cost of product revenues in the period the revision is made 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
inventory write downs amounted to million  million  and million  for fiscal years   and  respectively 
allowances for doubtful accounts we record a provision for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and a detailed assessment of the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  our management considers  among other factors  the aging of the accounts receivable  including trends within and ratios involving the age of the accounts receivable  our historical write offs  the credit worthiness of each customer  the economic conditions of the customer s industry  and general economic conditions  especially given the recent financial crisis in today s economic environment 
in cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet their financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance against amounts due from the customer  and thereby reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at july  and  respectively 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences  along with net operating loss carryforwards  if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences  research and credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards are deductible 
to the extent deferred tax assets cannot be recognized under the preceding criteria  a valuation allowance is established 
as a result of our increasing profitability in fiscal  expectations for continued profits going forward  and expected material taxable income generated from intercompany payments resulting from our offshore tax restructuring to be implemented during fiscal year  we determined that it is more likely than not that future profitability will be sufficient to realize deferred income tax assets 
in accordance with asc and related literature  we released a majority of our valuation allowances against our deferred income tax assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal we continue to maintain million valuation allowance against a portion of our foreign net operating loss deferred tax assets 
net income for fiscal includes a discrete tax benefit of million which was largely attributed to the release of our valuation allowances and the recording of the associated net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet 
income tax contingencies are accounted for and may require significant management judgment in estimating final outcomes 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates and could significantly affect the effective tax rate and cash flows in future years 
as of july  and  we had million and million  respectively  of unrecognized tax benefits  which if recognized would affect our income tax expense

we added nearly  new customers during fiscal our network rightsizing and move architecture initiatives continues to gain momentum as companies move toward a new access network 
the rapid proliferation of wi fi enabled mobile devices  the increase in demand for multimedia rich mobility applications  and the rise of both server and desktop virtualization is driving this trend 
product revenues increased during fiscal compared to fiscal our product revenues were bolstered by an increase in revenue related to our n access points with new customers almost exclusively choosing to roll out n networks 
the increase in professional services and support revenues is a result of both increased product and first year support sales  and the renewal of support contracts by existing customers as our customer base continues to grow 

table of contents ratable product and related professional services and support revenues decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the run off in the amortization of deferred revenue associated with those customer contracts that we entered into prior to our establishment of vsoe of fair value 
the current balance of ratable deferred revenue  and subsequent ratable revenue  relates entirely to our acquisition of azalea 
we expect ratable product and related professional services and support revenues to continue to decrease in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in future periods 
revenues from our indirect sales channel increased during fiscal compared to fiscal and increased slightly as a percentage of revenue 
going forward  we expect to continue to derive a significant majority of our total revenues from indirect channels as we continue to focus on improving the efficiency of marketing and selling our products through these channels 
revenues from shipments to locations outside the united states increased during fiscal compared to fiscal due to strong demand across all of our geographies but decreased slightly as a percentage of revenue 
we continue to expand into international locations and introduce our products in new markets  and we expect international revenues to increase in absolute dollars and remain consistent or increase as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal total revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in product revenues of million 
product revenue increased due to strong demand and the growth in our customer base 
support revenue grew million in fiscal compared to fiscal as substantially all of our customers purchase support when they purchase our products 
the increase in revenue from our indirect sales channel was primarily due to increased leverage from our partner relationships 
cost of revenues and gross margin years ended july  in thousands total revenues cost of product cost of professional services and support cost of ratable product and related professional services and support total cost of revenues gross profit gross margin during fiscal total cost of revenues increased compared to fiscal primarily due to the corresponding increase in our product revenue 
the substantial majority of our cost of product revenues consists of payments to flextronics  our largest contract manufacturer 
for fiscal  payments to flextronics and flextronics related costs constituted approximately of our cost of product revenues and sercomm constituted approximately of our cost of product revenues 
cost of professional services and support revenues increased during fiscal compared to fiscal these increases were primarily due to an increase in headcount in our support and professional services organization to meet the growing demand for these services  including personnel who joined aruba as a result of the acquisition of azalea in september cost of ratable product and related professional services and support revenues decreased during these periods consistent with the decrease in ratable product and related professional services and support revenues 
as we expand internationally  we may incur additional costs to conform our products to comply with local laws or local product specifications 
in addition  we plan to continue to hire additional personnel to support our growing international customer base which would increase our cost of professional services and support 

table of contents gross margins increased during fiscal compared to fiscal this increase is due in part to favorable product mix  timing of support renewals and contracts  and channel mix partially offset by an increase in our international revenues and the lower gross margin profile associated with that revenue 
in fiscal cost of revenues increased compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in our product and support and professional services revenues 
gross margins increased during fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to product mix of sales on higher margin controllers and software and better mix of sales with higher margin channel partners 
further  during fiscal compared to fiscal we benefitted from economies of scale within our professional services department that kept our costs down despite the large increase in professional services and support revenues 
research and development expenses years ended july  in thousands research and development expenses percent of total revenues during fiscal  research and development expenses increased compared to fiscal  primarily due to an increase of million in personnel and related costs  including an increase in stock based compensation and associated payroll taxes of million 
the increase is directly related to an increase in headcount of employees  including from our acquisition of azalea 
facilities expenses increased million also due to the increase in headcount and the acquisition of the azalea facilities 
expenses for consulting and outside agencies increased by million as we increased our engineering program spend due to the ongoing evolution of our product roadmap 
depreciation expenses increased million and software and hardware maintenance fees increased million 
finally  amortization expense increased million as a result of our two acquisitions in fiscal during fiscal  research and development expenses increased compared to fiscal  primarily due to an increase of million in personnel and related costs as we added new employees to our research and development team 
personnel and related costs included million in stock based compensation and associated payroll taxes 
expenses for consulting and outside agencies increased million due to design and compliance work for our lower priced access point and controllers 
facilities expenses increased million related to the increase in headcount 
depreciation expense increased million due to an increase in fixtures  machinery and equipment used to design and test new products 
sales and marketing expenses years ended july  in thousands sales and marketing expenses percent of total revenues during fiscal  sales and marketing expenses increased compared to fiscal personnel and related costs increased million primarily due to an increase in headcount of employees 
an increase in stock based compensation and associated payroll taxes of million contributed to the increase in personnel and related costs 
commission expense increased million corresponding to the increase in revenue 
marketing expenses increased million due to new product launches  specifically for our move architecture launch  and user group conventions we hosted

we also had research and credit carryforwards of million for federal and million for state income tax purposes as of july  realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
if not utilized  the federal and state net operating loss and federal tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire between and utilization of these net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation due to provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  that are applicable if we have experienced an ownership change in the past  or if an ownership change occurs in the future 
we continuously monitor the circumstances impacting the expected realization of our deferred tax assets 
as of july   based on available positive evidence  we determined that the majority of our deferred tax assets would be more likely than not realizable in the near future  with the exception of certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards as we cannot forecast sufficient future foreign source income to realize these deferred tax assets before they expire 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded a tax benefit of million which was largely attributed to the release of our valuation allowances and the recording of the associated net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we recognize in the consolidated financial statements only those tax positions determined to be more likely than not of being sustained 
we recorded a net increase of less than million to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken in prior periods 
additionally  we did not make any reclassifications between current taxes payable and long term taxes payable

table of contents liquidity and capital resources july  july  in thousands working capital cash and cash equivalents short term investments years ended july  in thousands cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities as of july   our principal sources of liquidity were our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
cash and cash equivalents are comprised of cash  sweep funds and money market funds with an original maturity of days or less at the time of the purchase 
short term investments include corporate bonds  us government agency securities  us treasury bills  commercial paper  and certificates of deposit 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased million during fiscal from million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of july  to million as of july  cash flows from operating activities our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by our profitability  working capital requirements  the extent to which we increase spending on personnel and the continued growth in revenue and cash collections 
the timing of hiring sales personnel in particular affects cash flows as there is a lag between the hiring of sales personnel and the generation of revenue and cash flows from sales personnel 
our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers 
our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures  purchases of inventory  and rent payments 
during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities increased million compared to fiscal the increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash flow of million from operations after adjusting for non cash items  including depreciation and amortization  and stock based compensation  and a decrease of million from the change in operating assets and liabilities

see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
cash used in investing activities increased million during fiscal compared to fiscal we purchased more short term investments during fiscal compared to fiscal as we reinvested cash flow from operations 
we also sold fewer short term investments in fiscal compared to fiscal purchases of property and equipment in fiscal were slightly up compared to fiscal due to the build out of our office headquarters 

table of contents cash flows from financing activities cash provided by financing activities increased million during fiscal compared to fiscal the cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock in conjunction with our equity incentive plan and employee stock purchase plan increased substantially year over year primarily due to increased exercises of stock options by our employees as a result of the increase in our exercise price and an increase in the amount of contributions in our employee stock purchase plan 
cash provided by financing activities increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal also due to the cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock in conjunction with our equity plans as described above 
during fiscal we repurchased shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program in the amount of million 
we did not make any additional purchases in fiscal or fiscal related to that program 
based on our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments we expect that we will have sufficient resources to fund our operations for the next months 
however  we may need to raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness to continue to fund our operations in the future 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the timing and extent of expansion into new territories  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  and the continuing market acceptance of our products 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations more less than than total year years years years in thousands operating leases non cancellable inventory purchase commitments total contractual obligations we outsource the production of our hardware to third party manufacturing suppliers 
we enter into various inventory related purchase agreements with these suppliers

as such  there are no material amounts of contractual obligations associated with these unrecognized benefits to be included in the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements as of july  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk most of our sales contracts are denominated in us dollars  and therefore  our revenue is not subject to significant foreign currency risk 
our operating expenses and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the british pound  euro  and chinese yuan 
to date  we 
table of contents have not entered into any hedging contracts because expenses in foreign currencies have been insignificant  and exchange rate fluctuations have had little impact on our operating results and cash flows 
interest rate sensitivity we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million and million at july  and  respectively 
the cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are held for working capital purposes 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we have an investment portfolio of fixed income securities that are classified as available for sale securities 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we attempt to limit this exposure by investing primarily in short term securities 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a movement of in market interest rates would not have a material impact on our operating results and the total value of the portfolio over the next fiscal year 
if overall interest rates had fallen by during fiscal  our interest income on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments would have declined less than million assuming consistent investment levels
