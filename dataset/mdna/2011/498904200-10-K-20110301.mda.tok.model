during  we faced many challenges as we focused on emerging from one of the worst downturns in the history of our industry 
during  our industry trade organization  the business and institutional furniture manufacturers association  or bifma  reported that industry sales declined when compared to this is one of the steepest declines our industry has ever experienced 
coming into we were uncertain as to when or if a recovery would begin 
however  we maintained our focus on our core commitment to design and quality  managed our balance sheet  protected our profitability and invested through the cycle in exciting innovative new designs so we would be well positioned to emerge from the downturn stronger than ever 
as we began to see signs of recovery during the second half of this is exactly what happened 
bifma reported an industry sales increase of for 
our sales for the year increased a modest when compared with however  our fourth quarter sales increased when compared with the fourth quarter of our seating sales experienced double digit growth during the year as sales of our award winning generation by knoll work chair continued to increase 
systems  which historically has represented a large percentage of our overall sales  experienced significant growth during the third and fourth quarters of this year when compared with the prior year 
our high margin specialty businesses also began generating growth during the second half of the year 
growth in europe outpaced north american during some of the biggest challenges we faced during were price competition  rising material prices and the strengthening of the canadian dollar 
price competition continued to pressure our margins as did the rising cost of steel 
price deterioration cost us million during during the second half of  expedited freight costs to meet the rising customer demand also negatively impacted our gross margin 
during the full year  gross margin decreased from in to in operating profit was million  or of sales  for and includes restructuring charges of million 
these restructuring charges relate to the announced march plan to better utilize our manufacturing capacity  eliminate duplication of capabilities and reduce associated costs 
our operating profit increased in when compared with the prior year

in  we will continue to work to diversify our portfolio of products away from such a substantial reliance on office systems 
we will continue to focus on increasing our market share in seating and our high margin specialty businesses and are excited about the introduction of regeneration by knoll in in addition  with new selling relationships in the middle east  brazil and india  we look forward to continued international growth in and beyond

geographically our european sales increased at a greater pace than north america 
at december   sales backlog was million  an increase of million  or  from sales backlog of million as of december  as we went through  it began to appear that signs were in place for a recovery to begin in the industry 
business confidence began to improve as did service sector employment 
the fourth quarter of was the first quarter since of positive office space absorption and  at the end of  the architectural billings index was at its highest point since november the architectural billings index is provided by the american institute of architects and shows the nine to twelve month lag between architecture billings and construction spending 
all these signs led to our sales increasing on a year over year basis during the third and fourth quarters of sales to governmental entities and agencies remained strong in approximately of our sales were to federal  state and local governmental entities and related agencies 
pricing pressure continued to have a significant impact on sales 
the recent industry decline has led to a very competitive pricing environment as the industry competes for a smaller pool of business 
we believe we have been able to offset some of this pressure through our cost reduction activities 
however  pricing pressures had a negative impact on our gross margin performance n we recently implemented a price increase that should alleviate some of this pressure next year as we anticipate further recovery in the industry 
bifma is forecasting an increase in industry sales for 
table of contents gross profit and operating income gross profit for was million  a decrease of million  or  from gross profit of million for operating income for was million  an increase of million  or  from operating income of million for as a percentage of sales  gross profit decreased from for to for the largest contributors to this decline were price deterioration and material inflation  particularly steel 
the strengthening of the canadian dollar during also negatively affected our gross margin 
operating income as a percentage of sales decreased from in to in operating profit for includes restructuring charges of million compared to million in operating expenses for  excluding restructuring charges  were million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  for the modest decrease in operating expenses during was in large part due to cost control measures that were put in place during the downturn in the industry and which more than offset by increased incentive compensation this year 
during  we incurred restructuring charges of approximately million 
these charges included million of employee termination costs  million of costs associated with the write off of fixed assets that we determined had no future benefit  and million of costs related to facility realignment 
during  we incurred restructuring charges of approximately million 
these charges included million of employee termination costs  million of costs associated with the exiting of three leased showrooms  and million of costs associated with the discontinuation of certain product lines 
interest expense interest expense for was million  an increase of million from interest expense of million for the increase in interest expense is primarily due to the interest rate swap agreements that we entered into during that went into effect during the second quarter of these agreements expire june  see note of our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k for further information regarding the interest rate swaps

table of contents years ended december  and sales sales for were million  a decrease of million  or  from sales of billion for for the year ended december   we experienced double digit declines across all product categories and geographies when compared to the prior year 
at december   sales backlog was million  a decrease of million  or  from sales backlog of million as of december  in  the global recession greatly impacted the office furniture industry 
a widespread lack of business confidence and growing unemployment levels increased office vacancy rates and lowered the demand for our products  especially office systems 
office systems as a product category were impacted the most by the decline in demand with sales declining when compared to although we have diversified our sales over recent years by growing our seating and specialty businesses to make us less dependent on the office systems category  office systems still represent a significant portion of our sales 
sales to the us government remained strong in and became a larger portion of our overall revenue in approximately of our sales were to the us government and related agencies 
although the recent recession has been worldwide  geographically our european sales declined at a greater pace than north america in the substantial reduction in industry demand has resulted in a very competitive pricing environment as our industry competes for a smaller pool of business 
this pricing pressure had a significant impact on sales  but we believe we managed to stay competitive and offset some of this pricing pressure through our cost reduction activities 
gross profit and operating income gross profit for was million  a decrease of million  or  from gross profit of million for operating income for was million  a decrease of million  or  from operating income of million for we are relatively pleased with the profit levels we reported in given the significant deterioration in industry demand and a reduction of million in our sales from as a percentage of sales  gross profit decreased from for to for the decrease in gross margin during was primarily due to price deterioration and lower absorption of our fixed costs as a result of our lower sales volumes 
operating income as a percentage of sales decreased from in to in operating profit for includes restructuring charges of million compared to million in operating expenses for  excluding restructuring charges  were million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  for the decrease in operating expenses during was in large part due to decreased spending in conjunction with our lower sales volumes 
decreased sales and incentive compensation accounted for million of the reduction

these charges 
table of contents included million of employee termination costs and million of costs associated with the discontinuation of certain product lines 
interest expense interest expense for was million  a decrease of million from interest expense of million for the decrease in interest expense was largely due to lower borrowing rates 
two interest rate swap agreements that we entered into during went into effect during the second quarter of and resulted in an increased rate for the second half of for the year ended december   additional interest expense of million was incurred as a result of these swap agreements 
see note of our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k for further information regarding the interest rate swaps 
taking into account the effect of the interest rate swap payments  the weighted average interest rate for was

other expense income  net other expense for was million  comprised primarily of a million loss due to foreign currency translation and million of miscellaneous income 
other income for was million  comprised primarily of a million gain due to foreign currency translation and a million of miscellaneous income 
income tax expense the mix of pretax income and the varying effective tax rates in the countries in which we operate directly affects our consolidated effective tax rate 
the effective tax rate was for compared to for liquidity and capital resources the following table highlights certain key cash flows and capital information pertinent to the discussion that follows in thousands cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures cash used in investing activities purchase of common stock for treasury repayment of debt  net payment of dividends proceeds from issuance of common stock cash used in financing activities historically  we have carried significant amounts of debt  and cash generated by operating activities has been used to fund working capital  capital expenditures  repurchase shares and scheduled payments of principal and interest under our debt 
our capital expenditures are typically for new product tooling and manufacturing equipment 
these capital expenditures support new products and continuous improvements in our manufacturing processes 
in addition  we are currently evaluating a new enterprise resource planning system with implementation to begin in expenses associated with this system implementation will increase spending over the next few years 
cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities 
table of contents consisted of million from net income plus various non cash charges which included million of non cash expense related to the ineffective portion of the interest rate swaps and a million write off of assets due to restructuring  and million of favorable changes in assets and liabilities 
for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities consisted of million from net income  plus non cash charges  offset by million of unfavorable changes in working capital 
for the year ended december   we used available cash  including the million of cash from operating activities to repay million of debt  fund million in capital expenditures  fund dividend payments to shareholders totaling million  and to fund working capital 
in  we used available cash  including the million of cash from operating activities to repay million of debt  fund million in capital expenditures  fund dividend payments to shareholders totaling million  and to fund working capital 
we use our existing secured million revolving credit facility in the ordinary course of business to fund our working capital needs  and at times make significant borrowings and repayments under the facility depending on our cash needs and availability at such time 
this facility matures in june and provides us with the option to increase the size of the facility by up to an additional million  subject to the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions 
as of december   there was approximately million outstanding under the facility  compared to million outstanding under the facility as of december  borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be repaid at any time  but no later than june our revolving credit facility requires that we comply with two financial covenants i our consolidated leverage ratio  defined as the ratio of total indebtedness to consolidated ebitda as defined in our credit agreement for a period of four fiscal quarters  cannot exceed to  and ii our consolidated interest coverage ratio  defined as the ratio of our consolidated ebitda as defined in our credit agreement for a period of four fiscal quarters to our consolidated interest expense  must be a minimum of to we are also required to comply with various other affirmative and negative covenants  including without limitation  covenants that prevent or restrict our ability to pay dividends  engage in certain mergers or acquisitions  make certain investments or loans  incur future indebtedness  make significant capital expenditures  engage in sale leaseback transactions  alter our capital structure or line of business  prepay subordinated indebtedness  engage in certain transactions with affiliates and sell stock or assets 
we are currently in compliance with all of the covenants and conditions under our credit facility 
we believe that existing cash balances and internally generated cash flows  together with borrowings available under our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to fund normal working capital needs  capital spending requirements  debt service requirements and dividend payments for at least the next twelve months 
however  because of the financial covenants mentioned above  our capacity under our revolving credit facility could be reduced if our trailing consolidated ebitda as defined by our credit agreement would decline due to deteriorating market conditions 
future principal debt payments may be paid out of cash flows from operations  from future refinancing of our debt or from equity issuances 
however  our ability to make scheduled payments of principal  to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness  to satisfy our other debt obligations and to pay dividends to stockholders will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  business and other factors beyond our control 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than year to years to years more than years total long term debt operating leases purchase commitments pension plan contributions a postretirement benefit plan obligations a total a due to the uncertainty of future cash outflows  contributions to the pension and other post retirement benefit plans subsequent to have been excluded from the table above 
b due to the uncertainty of future cash outflows  uncertain tax positions have been excluded from the table above 
contractual obligations for long term debt include principal and interest payments 
interest has been included at either the fixed rate or the variable rate in effect as of december   as applicable 
environmental matters our past and present business operations and the past and present ownership and operation of manufacturing plants on real property are subject to extensive and changing federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations  including those relating to discharges to air  water and land  the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances 
as a result  we are involved from time to time in administrative and judicial proceedings and inquiries relating to environmental matters and could become subject to fines or penalties related thereto 
we cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future  how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist 
compliance with more stringent laws or regulations  or stricter interpretation of existing laws  may require additional expenditures by us  some of which may be material 
we have been identified as a potentially responsible party pursuant to the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla for remediation costs associated with waste disposal sites that we previously used 
the remediation costs and our allocated share at some of these cercla sites are unknown 
we may also be subject to claims for personal injury or contribution relating to cercla sites 
we reserve amounts for such matters when expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of certain contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from such estimates 
we believe that the critical accounting policies that follow are those policies that require the most judgment  estimation and assumption in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients and dealers to make required payments 
the allowance is determined through an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable and assessments of risk that are based on historical trends and an evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions 
we evaluate the past due status of our trade receivables based on contractual terms of sale 
if the financial condition of our clients and dealers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
accounts receivable are charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when we determine that recovery is unlikely 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
we write down inventory that  in our judgment  is impaired or obsolete 
obsolescence may be caused by the discontinuance of a product line  changes in product material specifications  replacement products in the marketplace and other competitive influences 
goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets consist of goodwill  trademarks and deferred financing fees 
goodwill is recorded at the amount by which cost exceeds the net assets of acquired businesses  and all other intangible assets are recorded at cost 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually unless indicators of impairment exist 
financing costs that are incurred by us in connection with the issuance of debt are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the life of the underlying indebtedness 
the period of these costs may be shortened if the underlying indebtedness is modified or retired 
product warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and by material usage and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
cost estimates are based on historical product failure rates and identified one time fixes for each specific product category 
warranty cost generally varies in direct relation to sales volume  as such costs tend to be a consistent percentage of revenue 
should actual costs differ from original estimates  the estimated warranty liability would be revised 
employee benefits we are partially self insured for our employee health benefits 
we accrue for employee health benefit obligations based on an actuarial valuation 
the actuarial valuation is based upon historical claims as well as a number of assumptions  including rates of inflation for medical costs  and benefit plan changes 
actual results could be materially different from the estimates used 

table of contents pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor two defined benefit pension plans and two other postretirement benefit plans that cover substantially all of our us employees 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
key factors include assumptions about the expected rates of return on plan assets  discount rates  and health care cost trend rates  as determined by us  within certain guidelines 
we consider market conditions  including changes in investment returns and interest rates  in making these assumptions 
we determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets based on aggregating the expected rates of return for each component of the plan asset mix 
we use historic plan asset returns combined with current market conditions to estimate the rate of return 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is a long term assumption and generally does not change annually 
the discount rate reflects the market rate for high quality fixed income debt instruments as of our annual measurement date and is subject to change each year 
holding all other assumptions constant  a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would decrease or increase net periodic pension expense by approximately million 
likewise  a one percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would decrease or increase net periodic pension expense by approximately million or million  respectively 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are recognized over the expected remaining service life of the employee group 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors  including experience and assumption changes with respect to the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on plan assets 
these unrecognized gains and losses are systematically recognized as a change in future net periodic pension expense in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance relating to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
key assumptions we use in determining the amount of the obligation and expense recorded for postretirement benefits other than pensions opeb  under the appropriate accounting guidance  include the assumed discount rate and the assumed rate of increases in future health care costs 
the discount rate we use to determine the obligation for these benefits matches the discount rate used in determining our pension obligations in each year presented 
in estimating the health care cost trend rate  we consider actual health care cost experience  future benefit structures  industry trends and advice from our actuaries 
we assume that the relative increase in health care costs will generally trend downward over the next several years  reflecting assumed increases in efficiency and cost containment initiatives in the health care system 
at december   the expected rate of increase in future health care costs was in determining the benefit obligation for and in determining the net periodic benefit cost for the rate was then assumed to decrease to an ultimate rate of for and thereafter for the benefit obligation 
increasing the assumed health care cost trend by one percentage point in each year would increase the benefit obligation as of december  by million and increase the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for by approximately million 
decreasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by one percentage point in each year would decrease the benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million and decrease the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for by approximately million 
in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance  we recognize in our consolidated balance sheet the funded status ie the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation of our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans 
to record the unfunded status of our plans we recorded an additional liability and an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the actuarial assumptions we use in determining our pension and opeb retirement benefits may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower 
table of contents withdrawal rates  or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
commitments and contingencies we establish reserves for the estimated cost of environmental and legal contingencies when such expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable 
a significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters 
we engage outside experts as deemed necessary or appropriate to assist in the evaluation of exposure 
from time to time  as information becomes available regarding changes in circumstances for ongoing issues as well as information regarding emerging issues  our potential liability is reassessed and reserve balances are adjusted as necessary 
revisions to our estimates of potential liability  and actual expenditures related to environmental and legal contingencies  could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance relating to income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
the appropriate accounting guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be recognized 
at december   deferred tax liabilities of million exceeded deferred tax assets of million by million 
at december   our deferred tax liabilities of million exceeded deferred tax assets of million by million 
our deferred tax assets at december  and of million and million  respectively  are net of valuation allowances of million and million  respectively 
we have recorded the above valuation allowance primarily for net operating loss carryforwards in foreign tax jurisdictions where we have incurred historical tax losses from operations or acquired tax losses through acquisition  and have determined that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we evaluate on an ongoing basis the realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust the amount of the allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include our forecast of future taxable income and our assessment of available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance relating to uncertainty in income taxes 
accordingly  we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  in an income tax return 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
interest rate swap agreements on may   we entered into four interest rate swap agreements for purposes of managing our risk in interest rate fluctuations 
these agreements each hedge a notional amount of million of our borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
two of the agreements were effective june  and expired on june  on these two agreements  we paid a fixed rate of and received a variable rate of interest equal to three month london interbank offered rate libor  as determined on the last day of each quarterly settlement period 
the other two agreements were effective on june  and expire on june  we pay a fixed rate of on these two agreements and receive a variable rate of interest equal to three month libor 

table of contents the company has elected to apply hedge accounting to these swap agreements 
changes in the fair value of the effective portion of the interest rate swap agreements are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the equity section of the balance sheet 
the net amount paid or received upon quarterly settlements is recorded as an adjustment to interest expense  with a corresponding reduction in other comprehensive income loss 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation according to applicable accounting guidance  which requires the company to expense the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
this expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period following the date of grant 
the fair value for stock options is estimated at the date of grant using a lattice option pricing model  which requires management to make certain assumptions 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury spot rate with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant 
expected volatility is estimated based on the historical volatility of the company stock price 
the model takes into consideration the historical dividends paid on common stock 
the weighted average expected life is based on the contractual term of the stock option and expected employee exercise dates  which is based on the historical exercise behavior of the company employees 
forfeitures are estimated at the date of grant based on historical experience 
there were no stock options granted during recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued an amendment related to the accounting for business combinations to address diversity in practice about the interpretation of the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations 
this standard will become effective for the company on january  and may have a material impact on the company consolidated financial statements if there are future acquisitions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during the normal course of business  we are routinely subjected to market risk associated with interest rate movements and foreign currency exchange rate movements 
interest rate risk arises from our debt obligations and related interest rate swap agreements 
foreign currency exchange rate risk arises from our non us operations and purchases of inventory from foreign suppliers 
we also have risk in our exposure to certain material and transportation costs 
steel  leather  wood products and plastics are all used in the manufacture of our products 
for the year ended december   material inflation was approximately million and transportation deflation was approximately million 
during  material inflation was approximately million and transportation inflation was approximately million 
we continue to work to offset price increases in raw materials and transportation through our global sourcing initiatives  cost improvements and price increases to our products 
interest rate risk we have variable rate debt obligations that are denominated in us dollars 
a change in interest rates impacts the interest incurred and cash paid on the variable rate debt 
we use interest rate swap agreements for other than trading purposes in order to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt 
in may of  we entered into four interest rate swap agreements in order to manage our interest rate risk 
each agreement hedges a 
table of contents notional amount of million 
two of the agreements were effective from june  through june  and the other two were effective june  and expire june  fluctuations in libor affect both our net financial instrument position and the amount of cash to be paid or received by us  if any  under these agreements

we will continue to review our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and evaluate whether we should manage such exposures through derivative transactions 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we manufacture our products in the united states  canada and italy  and sell our products primarily in those markets as well as in other european countries 
our foreign sales and certain expenses are transacted in foreign currencies 
our production costs  profit margins and competitive position are affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where we manufacture or purchase goods relative to the strength of the currencies in countries where our products are sold 
additionally  as our reporting currency is the us dollar  our financial position is affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where we have operations relative to the strength of the us dollar 
the principal foreign currencies in which we conduct business are the canadian dollar and the euro 
approximately and of our revenues in and  respectively  and and of our cost of goods sold in and  respectively  were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a million translation loss in and a million translation loss in the translation gains losses do not reflect the impact of the translation of our operating results which are transacted in foreign countries 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency option contracts for other than trading purposes in order to manage our exposure to foreign exchange
