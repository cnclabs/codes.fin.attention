overview background we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company committed to discovering  developing and commercializing products targeting inflammation  bleeding and disorders of the central nervous system 
our most clinically advanced product candidates are derived from our proprietary pharmacosurgery platform designed to improve clinical outcomes of patients undergoing arthroscopic  ophthalmological  urological and other surgical and medical procedures 
our pharmacosurgery platform is based on low dose combinations of therapeutic agents delivered directly to the surgical site throughout the duration of the procedure to preemptively inhibit inflammation and other problems caused by surgical trauma and to provide clinical benefits both during and after surgery 
we currently have six ongoing clinical development programs  including four from our pharmacosurgery platform and two from our addiction franchise 
our most advanced clinical development program is in a phase clinical program evaluating omshp for arthroscopy in patients undergoing arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament  or acl  reconstruction 
we expect to announce data from this program during the first quarter of in addition  we have a deep and diverse pipeline of preclinical programs as well as a platform capable of unlocking new drug targets 
for each of our product candidates and programs  we have retained all manufacturing  marketing and distribution rights 
omshp  our lead pharmacosurgery product candidate  is in two clinical programs 
the first is a phase clinical program evaluating omshp s safety and ability to improve postoperative joint function and reduce pain following acl reconstruction surgery 
the second program is preparing for phase clinical trials to evaluate omshp s safety and ability to improve postoperative joint function and reduce pain following arthroscopic partial meniscectomy surgery 
we expect to release the results from our ongoing phase clinical program for acl reconstruction surgery in the first quarter of we believe that omshp will  if approved  be the first commercially available drug delivered directly to the surgical site to improve function following arthroscopic surgery 
our other current pharmacosurgery product candidates are oms  being developed for use during ophthalmological procedures  including cataract and other lens replacement surgery  and oms  being developed for use during urological surgery  including uroendoscopic procedures 
we are conducting a phase b clinical trial for oms to assess the effect of the mydriatic api and the anti inflammatory api in a full factorial design 
we expect to release the results from this phase b study during the first quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we successfully completed a phase phase clinical trial of in patients undergoing ureteroscopic removal of ureteral or renal stones 
the data showed that oms was safe and well tolerated by the patients in this study 
in addition to our pharmacosurgery platform  we have a pipeline of additional product development programs targeting inflammation  bleeding and the cns 
in our pparg program  we are developing proprietary compositions that include pparg agonists for the treatment and prevention of addiction to substances of abuse  
table of contents which may include opioids  nicotine and alcohol 
the national institute on drug abuse  or nida  is funding substantially all of the costs of two phase clinical study evaluating a pparg agonist in the treatment of addiction to oxycontin and heroin 
these phase clinical studies are being conducted by researchers at the new york state psychiatric institute  or nyspi 
in our plasmin program  we are advancing novel antifibrinolytic agents for the control of blood loss during surgery or resulting from trauma 
our pde program is based on our discoveries of previously unknown links between pde and any movement disorder  such as parkinson s disease  as well as addiction and compulsive disorders  and we are developing proprietary compounds for the treatment of these and other disorders 
in our mannan binding lectin associated serine protease  or masp  program  we are developing proprietary masp antibody therapies to treat disorders caused by complement activated inflammation 
in our pde program  we are developing proprietary compounds to treat schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders 
in our gpcr program  we are working to complete high throughput de orphanization of orphan gpcrs  or the identification of synthetic molecules that bind the receptors  and to develop product candidates that act at these new potential drug targets 
we have already announced that we have identified and confirmed sets of compounds that interact selectively with  and modulate signaling of a series of orphan gpcrs  including orphans linked to squamous cell carcinoma gpr  pancreatic cancer gpr  obesity gpr  appetite control gpr and cognitive disorders gpr 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into an agreement with vulcan inc and its affiliate  which we refer to collectively as vulcan  pursuant to which we received million for our gpcr program 
also during the same quarter  we entered into an agreement with the state of washington s life sciences discovery fund authority  or lsdf  under which we received a million grant award that will be paid against expenses that we incur for our gpcr program 
in exchange for these payments  we agreed to pay to vulcan and lsdf a portion of net proceeds that we receive from the gpcr program 
we also issued to the vulcan affiliate three five year warrants to purchase our common stock  each for  shares  with exercise prices of  and per share  respectively 
following the receipt of the million from vulcan  we purchased from patobios limited  or patobios  intellectual property assets related to an assay technology for use in the gpcr program 
the purchase price for these assets was approximately million canadian dollars  or cad  of which approximately million cad million usd was paid in cash and million cad million usd was paid in shares of our common stock 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million and total shareholders equity was million 
we recognized net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these losses have resulted principally from expenses incurred in connection with research and development activities  consisting primarily of clinical trials  preclinical studies and manufacturing services associated with our current product candidates 
compared to  we expect our net losses to increase as we continue to advance our clinical trials  expand our research and development efforts and add personnel as well as laboratory and office space for our anticipated growth 
in addition  if we receive positive data from our phase program evaluating omshp in acl reconstruction surgery  our net losses may increase further as a result of expanded commercialization activities 
on october   we completed our initial public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
net cash proceeds from the public offering were approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses paid or payable by us following the offering 
revenue we have recognized million of revenue from inception through december   consisting of grant funding from third parties and revenue recognized in connection with our gpcr program funding agreements with vulcan and lsdf 
other than grant funding  we do not expect to receive any revenue from our product candidates until we receive regulatory approval and commercialize the product candidates or until we potentially 
table of contents enter into collaborative agreements with third parties for the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
we continue to pursue government and private grant funding for our product candidates and research programs 
research and development expenses the majority of our operating expenses to date have been for research and development activities 
research and development expenses consist of costs associated with research activities  as well as costs associated with our product development efforts  which include clinical trials and third party manufacturing services 
internal research and development costs are recognized as incurred 
third party research and development costs are expensed at the earlier of when the contracted work has been performed or as upfront and milestone payments are made 
research and development expenses include employee and consultant related expenses  which include salaries and benefits  external research and development expenses incurred pursuant to agreements with third party manufacturing organizations  contract research organizations  clinical trial sites  and collaborators or licensors  facilities  depreciation and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment  and third party supplier expenses including laboratory and other supplies 
our internal resources  employees and infrastructure are not directly tied to any individual research project and are typically deployed across multiple projects 
through our clinical development programs  we are advancing our product candidates in parallel for multiple therapeutic indications and  through our preclinical development programs  we are seeking to develop potential product candidates for additional disease indications 
due to the number of ongoing projects and our ability to utilize resources across several projects  we do not record or maintain information regarding the costs incurred for our research and development programs on a program specific basis 
research and development expenses from inception july  to december  were million 
our research and development expenses can be divided into clinical research and development and preclinical research and development activities 
the following table illustrates our expenses associated with these activities years ended december  in thousands clinical research and development salaries  benefits  and related costs clinical trials manufacturing services  consulting  laboratory supplies  and other costs other costs stock based compensation total clinical research and development expenses preclinical research and development salaries  benefits  and related costs research and preclinical studies  consulting  laboratory supplies  and other costs other costs stock based compensation total preclinical research and development expenses total research and development expenses 
table of contents clinical research and development costs consist of clinical trials  manufacturing services  regulatory activities and related personnel costs  and other costs such as rent  utilities  depreciation and stock based compensation 
preclinical research and development costs consist of our research activities  preclinical studies  related personnel costs and laboratory supplies  and other costs such as rent  utilities  depreciation and stock based compensation 
at this time  due to the inherently unpredictable nature of preclinical and clinical development processes and given the early stage of our preclinical product development programs  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our product candidates for potential commercialization 
clinical development timelines  the probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations 
while we are currently focused on advancing each of our product development programs  our future research and development expenses will depend on the clinical success of each product candidate  as well as ongoing assessments of each product candidate s commercial potential 
in addition  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which product candidates may be subject to future collaborations  when such arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase in the future as we continue the advancement of our clinical trials and preclinical product development programs as well as accelerate and expand our research efforts in our gpcr program 
the lengthy process of completing clinical trials and seeking regulatory approval for our product candidates requires expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure or delay in completing clinical trials  or in obtaining regulatory approvals  could cause a delay in generating product revenue and cause our research and development expense to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we do not expect any of our current product candidates to be commercially available before  if at all 
because of the factors above  we are not able to estimate with any certainty when we would recognize any net cash inflows from our projects 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive  legal  finance  accounting  business development  information technology and human resource functions 
other general and administrative expenses include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses  patent costs and professional fees for legal  consulting and audit services 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in the future as we add additional employees and facilities to support our anticipated growth as a public company 
in addition  if we receive positive data from our phase program evaluating omshp in acl reconstruction surgery  our net losses may increase further as a result of expanded commercialization activities 
investment income investment income consists of realized gains on sales of investments and interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
interest expense interest expense consists of interest on our notes payable and the amortization of the related discount 
loss on extinguishment of debt loss on extinguishment of debt consists of losses incurred as a result of the refinance of the notes payable to bluecrest venture finance master fund limited  or bluecrest 

table of contents other income expense other income expense consists primarily of income received from the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program  rental income received under subleases for use of a portion of our vivarium and laboratory facility and changes in the fair value of our preferred stock warrant liability 
income taxes as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
our net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards began to expire in and should continue to expire through unless utilized prior to such dates 
our ability to utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited in the event that a change in ownership  as defined in section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code  has occurred or may occur in the future 
in each period since our inception  we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our deferred tax asset  as the realization of the deferred tax asset is uncertain 
as a result  we have not recorded any federal tax benefit in our statement of operations 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as reported revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
an accounting policy is considered critical if it is important to a company s financial condition and results of operations  and if it requires the exercise of significant judgment and the use of estimates on the part of management in its application 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate  actual results may differ from our estimates 
we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies because they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require critical management judgment and estimates about matters that are uncertain revenue recognition  research and development expenses  primarily clinical trial expenses  stock based compensation  fair value measurement of financial instruments 
if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected 
revenue recognition our revenue since inception relates to grant funding from third parties and revenue recognized in connection with funding from vulcan and lsdf 
we recognize revenue when the related qualified research and development expenses are incurred or services are provided up to the limit of the approved funding amounts 
the accounting standards for revenue provide a framework for accounting for revenue arrangements 
a variety of factors are considered in determining the appropriate method of revenue recognition under these arrangements  such as whether the various elements can be considered separate units of accounting  whether there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for these elements and whether there is a separate earnings process associated with a particular element of an agreement 

table of contents research and development expenses research and development expenses are comprised primarily of employee and consultant related expenses  which include salaries and benefits  external research and development expenses incurred pursuant to agreements with third party manufacturing organizations  contract research organizations and clinical trial sites  facilities  depreciation and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment  and third party supplier expenses including laboratory and other supplies 
clinical trial expenses for investigational sites require certain estimates 
we estimate these costs based on a cost per patient that varies depending on the clinical trial site 
as actual costs become known to us  we adjust our estimates  these changes in estimates may result in understated or overstated expenses at a given point in time 
internal and third party research and development expenses are expensed as incurred 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under applicable accounting standards  which requires that the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all future share based payments made to employees and directors be based on estimated fair values 
we are using the straight line method to allocate compensation cost to reporting periods over each optionee s requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we estimate the fair value of our share based awards to employees and directors using the black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes model requires the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility  the calculation of expected term and the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant  among other inputs 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
as stock based compensation expense is based on options ultimately expected to vest  the expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
we estimate forfeitures based on our historical experience  separate groups of employees that have similar historical forfeiture behavior are considered separately for expense recognition 
stock options granted to non employees are accounted for using the fair value approach 
the fair value of non employee option grants are estimated using the black scholes option pricing model and are re measured over the vesting term as earned 
the estimated fair value is charged to expense over the applicable service period 
fair value measurement of financial instruments our financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value  defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability  an exit price  in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
in determining the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities  we used various valuation approaches 
the guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources such as quotes in active markets 
unobservable inputs are those in which little or no market data exists and reflect our assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
the availability of observable inputs can vary among the various types of financial assets and liabilities 
to the extent that the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market  the determination of fair value requires more judgment 

table of contents whenever the estimated fair value of any of our available for sale securities is less than their related cost  we perform an impairment analysis to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary 
a temporary impairment results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income component of shareholders equity 
such an unrealized loss does not affect net loss for the applicable accounting period 
however  an other than temporary impairment charge is recorded as a realized loss in the consolidated statement of operations and increases net loss for the applicable accounting period 
the primary factors we consider to differentiate our impairments between temporary and other than temporary impairments include the length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
we believe that the values assigned to our available for sale securities as of december   and are fairly stated in accordance with gaap and are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions 
in addition  we believe that the cost basis for our available for sale securities are recoverable in all material respects 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and december  revenue 
revenue was million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to the recognition of revenue in connection with funding from vulcan and lsdf for our gpcr program and additional revenue recognized in connection with our nih grants 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue recognized from grants from the michael j 
fox foundation  or mjff  for our pde program 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to higher consulting costs associated with our omshp program  higher clinical trial costs associated with our phase b clinical trial evaluating oms  higher contract service costs associated with several of our clinical and preclinical programs and an increase in employee expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with being a public company and an increase in employee expenses 
investment income 
investment income was  in compared to  in the decrease is due to lower market interest rates in compared to interest expense 
interest expense was million in compared to million in interest expense decreased in primarily due to lower interest expense on our borrowings from bluecrest and lower amortization of the related discount and debt issuance costs 
this was partially offset by the recognition of  of the remaining unamortized bluecrest debt issuance costs and debt discount in connection with the oxford refinance 
loss on extinguishment of debt 
the loss on extinguishment of debt was  in and relates entirely to losses incurred as a result of the refinancing of our borrowings from bluecrest 
other income expense 
other income was million in compared to million in the increase in other income is primarily due to income received from the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program partially offset by no warrant revaluation in 
table of contents comparison of years ended december  and december  revenue 
revenue was million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to higher grant revenue recognized under a grant from mjff for our pde program  and was partially offset by the recognition of decreased revenue in connection with grants from the nih 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million in compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in contract service costs associated with several of our clinical and preclinical programs and a reduction of clinical trial costs due to the prior completion of enrollment in the phase clinical study of omshp for arthroscopic meniscectomy surgery 
this was partially offset by an increase of  in technology acquisition option fees related to our right to purchase assets from patobios for use in our gpcr program 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to the write off of million of deferred offering costs related to a delay in our initial public offering during the period and lower stock based compensation expense in investment income 
investment income was  in compared to  in the decrease is due to lower market rates in compared to interest expense 
interest expense was million in compared to  in interest expense increased in due to interest expense on our borrowings from bluecrest and the amortization of the related discount 
other income expense 
other income was million in compared to other income of  in the increase in other income is primarily due to the revaluation of the fair value of warrants in and income from new sublease tenants 
liquidity and capital resources from inception to december   we have financed our operations primarily through private and public placements of equity securities for proceeds totaling million  through two debt facilities with loan proceeds totaling million  million of which was used to pay off the remaining balance of the first facility  and our gpcr program funding agreement with vulcan pursuant to which we received million 
the proceeds have been used to fund our operations 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances are held principally in interest bearing instruments  including money market accounts 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with established guidelines to preserve principal and maintain liquidity 
on october   we entered into an agreement with vulcan pursuant to which we received million for our gpcr program 
also on october   we entered into an agreement with the state of washington s life sciences discovery fund authority under which we received a million grant award that will be paid as reimbursement of expenses we incur and equipment purchases we make for our gpcr program 
in addition  we agreed to purchase from patobios intellectual property assets related to a proprietary cellular redistribution assay for consideration consisting of approximately million cad 
we completed the acquisition of these assets on november  by paying to patobios million cad million usd in cash and the remaining million cad million usd in the form of  shares of our common stock 
because vulcan provided the funding for these assets  such assets have a zero cost basis on our balance sheet 
in addition  on october  we entered into a million debt facility with oxford finance corporation  or oxford  pursuant to which oxford has agreed to lend us up to million in two tranches of 
table of contents million each 
upon signing the agreement  we borrowed the first tranche of million  approximately million of which we used to repay all outstanding amounts  including a prepayment fee  due under our loan and security agreement with bluecrest 
under our agreement with oxford  at any time before march  we may  at our sole option  borrow from oxford the second tranche of million  subject to our satisfaction of specified conditions precedent described in the agreement 
also  on october   we were awarded grants totaling approximately million from the us government pursuant to the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program 
we received approximately million in  which was recorded as other income  net  and we expect to receive the remaining  during the first quarter of comparison of years ended december  and december  operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
expenditures related to operating activities were a result of research and development expenses  clinical trial costs  and general and administrative expenses in support of our operations 
higher operating expenses in were offset by an increase in non cash stock based compensation and an increase in deferred revenue related to the vulcan funding 
investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  and net cash used in investing activities was million for the comparable period in since our inception  investing activities  other than purchases and maturities of short term and long term investments  consist primarily of purchases of property and equipment and  in  the acquisition  and subsequent reimbursement by vulcan of the purchase price  of intellectual property assets from patobios 
for the year ended december   proceeds from the sales of investments consisted primarily of investments purchased with proceeds from our ipo 
cash flows from investing activities primarily reflect large amounts of cash used to purchase short term investments and receipts from the sale and maturity of short term investments 
these amounts primarily relate to shifts between cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
because we manage our cash usage with respect to our total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  we do not consider these cash flows to be important to an understanding of our liquidity and capital resources 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  and net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december and net cash used in was primarily due to proceeds received from our loan from oxford  partially offset by the payoff of our bluecrest loan 
net cash provided for was due to the sale of common stock in our initial public offering in october for aggregate net proceeds of million 
comparison of years ended december  and december  operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
expenditures related to operating activities were a result of research and development expenses  clinical trial costs  and general and administrative expenses in support of our operations 
the decrease in net cash used in operating activities for was also impacted by lower non cash stock based compensation and a write off of deferred offering costs 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   and net cash provided by investing activities was million for the comparable period in investing activities for the year ended december  consisted primarily of investments purchased with proceeds from our ipo  partially offset by the shift of investments to cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net cash provided for was due to the sale of 
table of contents common stock in our initial public offering in october for aggregate net proceeds of million 
net cash provided in was primarily due to the borrowing of million under our loan from bluecrest 
in july  we entered into an equity line financing facility with azimuth opportunity  ltd  or azimuth  pursuant to which we may sell up to million of our shares of common stock over a month term 
from time to time over the month term  and in our sole discretion  we may present azimuth with draw down notices requiring azimuth to purchase a specified dollar amount of shares of our common stock  based on the volume weighted average price per share on each of consecutive trading days  or the draw down period  with the total dollar amount of each draw down subject to certain agreed upon limitations based on the market price of our common stock at the time of the draw down 
the purchase price for these shares equals the daily volume weighted average price of our common stock on each date during the draw down period on which shares are purchased  less a discount ranging from to  based on a minimum price that we solely specify 
in addition  in our sole discretion  but subject to certain limitations  we may require azimuth to purchase a percentage of the daily trading volume of our common stock for each trading day during the draw down period 
we are allowed to present azimuth with up to draw down notices during the month term  with only one such draw down notice allowed per draw down period and a minimum of five trading days required between each draw down period 
we may not issue more than  shares in connection with the committed equity line financing facility 
in partial consideration for azimuth s execution and delivery of the purchase agreement for the facility  we paid to azimuth  in cash 
we also paid  of azimuth s legal fees and expenses 
all costs were charged to general and administrative expense as incurred 
no additional legal fees incurred by azimuth are payable by us in connection with any sale of shares to azimuth 
in connection with this facility  we entered into a placement agent agreement with reedland capital partners  or reedland 
we have agreed to pay reedland  upon each sale of our common stock to azimuth  a fee equal to of the aggregate dollar amount of common stock purchased by azimuth upon settlement of each such sale 
on october   we entered into a million debt facility with oxford pursuant to which oxford agreed to lend us up to million in two tranches of million each 
upon signing the agreement  we borrowed the first tranche of million  or tranche  approximately million of which we used to repay all outstanding amounts  including a prepayment fee  due under our loan and security agreement with bluecrest 
upon payment of the approximately million to bluecrest on october   all of our liabilities to bluecrest were paid in full  and all commitments of bluecrest to us under the loan agreement were terminated 
under the terms of our agreement with oxford  at any time before march  we may  at our sole option  borrow from oxford the second tranche of million  or tranche  subject to our satisfaction of specified conditions precedent described in the agreement 
we may use the proceeds remaining from tranche and  if borrowed  tranche  for working capital and to fund our general business requirements 
interest on tranche accrues at an annual fixed rate of and  if borrowed  interest on tranche will accrue at an annual fixed rate equal to the month libor rate in effect immediately prior to the funding of tranche plus 
payments due under tranche and  if borrowed  tranche  are interest only  payable monthly  in arrears  through october  beginning november   payments of principal and interest are payable monthly  in arrears 
all unpaid principal and accrued and unpaid interest are due and payable on the maturity date  october  the oxford loan agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants  including covenants that limit or restrict our ability to  among other things  incur indebtedness  grant liens  merge or consolidate  dispose of assets  make investments  make acquisitions  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  pay dividends or make distributions  and repurchase stock  in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type 
the loan agreement contains no cash covenant 
the loan agreement also contains 
table of contents customary events of default that include  among other things  non payment defaults  inaccuracy of representations and warranties  covenant defaults  material adverse change default as defined in the agreement  cross default to material indebtedness  bankruptcy and insolvency defaults  material judgment defaults  and a change of control default 
we have no indication that we are in default of the material adverse change clause  and no scheduled loan payments have been accelerated as a result of this provision 
the occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the obligations under the loan agreement 
under certain circumstances  a default interest rate will apply on all obligations during the existence of an event of default at a per annum rate equal to above the otherwise applicable interest rate 
we made a one time facility fee payment to oxford of  for tranche and  if we borrow tranche  we will be required to make a second facility fee payment of  upon the last payment date of the amounts borrowed under from oxford  we will be required to pay oxford a final payment fee equal to of tranche  and  if borrowed  of tranche  provided that the percentage for tranche will decrease by for each month that lapses between the date of the oxford loan agreement and the funding date for tranche as security for our obligations under the loan agreement  we granted oxford a security interest in substantially all of our assets  excluding intellectual property 
we may prepay all  but not less than all  of the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest under the loan agreement at any time upon prior notice to oxford and the payment of a fee equal to of the then outstanding principal amount 
in connection with the oxford loan agreement  we incurred debt issuance costs of  in december  we entered into a funding agreement with the stanley medical research institute  or smri  to develop a proprietary product candidate that inhibits pde for the treatment of schizophrenia 
under the agreement  we may receive grant and equity funding upon achievement of product development milestones through phase clinical trials totaling million  subject to our mutual agreement with smri 
through december   we had received million from smri  of which million was recorded as equity funding  million was recorded as revenue  and  remains in deferred revenue 
in may  we entered into an additional agreement with mjff to provide funding for a study of pde inhibitors for the treatment of parkinson s disease 
the agreement was for a six month period and provides funding of actual costs incurred up to a total of  we received a payment of  in july we expect to receive the final payment of  in the first quarter of funding requirements we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating expenses  capital expenditures and note payments for at least the next months 
we base this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates  and to the extent that we may or may not enter into collaborations with third parties to participate in development and commercialization  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital requirements and operating expenditures required in the future 
our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the progress and results of our clinical trials for omshp  oms  oms and our pparg program  costs related to manufacturing services  whether the hiring of a number of new employees to support our continued growth during this period will occur at salary levels consistent with our estimates  the scope  rate of progress  results and costs of our preclinical testing  clinical trials and other research and development activities for additional product candidates

the new guidance addresses the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit 
this guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which is based on a vendor specific objective evidence  b third party evidence  or c estimates 
this guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
in addition  this guidance significantly expands required disclosures related to a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
we expect to adopt this guidance on january  and to apply it prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after the date of adoption 
the impact of the above guidance will be dependent on the terms and structure of revenue generating contracts negotiated in the future
