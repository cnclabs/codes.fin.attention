as discussed in detail in note  the company had no bank debt at year s end 
accrued commissions and sales incentives have increased between and the primary reason for the change pertains to an overall increase in sales  and related incentive programs with customers in  which produced higher payouts as certain customers reached growth tiers that they were not able to reach in the prior year

december  the company reported comparative results from continuing operations for the three month period ended december  and as follows three months ended december  in thousands net sales gross profit operating profits the company s sales increased from  in the three month period ended december  as compared to  in the three month period december  revenue for the three months ended december  reflects continued penetration of the company s proprietary products into the market  despite a weak construction environment 
overall  unit volume for the quarter was up approximately compared to the prior year quarter 
the change between the unit sales increase of and the dollar sales increase of  was largely connected to increased promotional sales incentives 
the company s gross profit margins have however decreased from to for the three month period ended december  and  respectively  mostly due to cost increases in numerous commodity type metals including nickel and brass  which adversely impact the price of the company s component material costs  such as stainless steel and fittings 
selling expenses 
selling expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and associated overhead costs  commissions  and the cost of marketing programs such as advertising  trade shows and related communication costs  and freight 
selling expense was  and  for the three months ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was largely attributable to increases in staffing expenses related to a shift in the management structure in the uk  designed to expand sales markets  along with an increase in commissions and freight on pace with sales volume

other income net primarily consists of foreign currency exchange gains losses on transactions 
income tax expense 
the company s effective tax rate in is lower than the rate due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessment related to the company filings in earlier years  which lowered the tax expense by for the three months ended december  the rate in both years does not differ materially from expected statutory rates 
twelve months ended december  vs 
december  the company reported comparative results from continuing operations for the twelve month period ended december  and as follows twelve months ended december  in thousands net sales gross profit operating profits the company s sales increased  from  in the twelve month period ended december  to  in the twelve month period december  unit volume for the twelve months was up approximately compared to the prior year  but the sales dollars were partially reduced by various sales deduction components  most significantly marketing incentives 
the growth reflects increased demand for the company s proprietary products  such as counterstrike  and overall outperformance of the market 
general housing statistics  such as housing starts actually decreased approximately from the prior year 
the company s gross profit margins were largely consistent with the prior year  being in the twelve month period ended december   and in the twelve month period ended december  the slight increase in margin is the result of various factors  including manufacturing efficiencies  mostly derived from increased sales volume  expired royalty charges  and a decrease in obsolete inventory of approximately  as the prior year absorbed higher expenses for identified excess parts 
the favorable components were however tamped down partially by an increase in price for numerous commodity type metals including nickel and brass  which adversely impact the price of material costs  such as stainless steel and fittings 
selling expenses 
selling expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and associated overhead costs  commissions  and the cost of marketing programs such as advertising  trade shows and related communication costs  and freight 
selling expense was  and  for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
there was an increase of attributable to staffing expenses with a majority of the increase related to a shift in the management structure in the uk  as resources were shifted to selling from administrative in an effort to expand sales markets 
also  as anticipated with an increase in sales volume  commissions and freight also rose 
travel increased as well 
sales expense as a percentage of sales increased from for the twelve months ended december  to for the same period in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries  benefits for administrative  executive and finance personnel  legal and accounting  and corporate general and administrative services 
general and administrative expenses were  and  for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative expense  as a percentage of sales  decreased from for the twelve months ended december  to for the twelve months ended december  the variance was actually the result of opposing changes 
there was a decrease in staffing expenses of  partially due to uk functions being shifted into selling expenses as noted above 
there was however an increase of in legal expenses  as the prior year included the favorable impact of related to the parker hannifin settlement  which therefore decreased the expense engineering expense 
engineering expenses consist of development expenses associated with the development of new products and enhancements to existing products  and manufacturing engineering costs 
engineering expenses were reasonably similar for the twelve months ended december  and  and were and as a percent of sales for their respective years 
reflecting all of the factors mentioned above  operating profit margins increased from a profit of  in the twelve month period ended december  to a profit of  in the twelve month period ended december  operating profit improved slightly as a percent of sales  being and in and  respectively 
interest expense income net 
interest income includes interest earned at on the note receivable from mestek  the company s former parent  which was issued in june  and paid back in october of interest expense was recorded at on the sovereign line of credit loan balance outstanding  which was established in december  and paid in full by the end of november the net increase in expense from of last year was other expense income net 
other income net primarily consists of foreign currency exchange gains losses on transactions 
there was an unfavorable change from last year of income tax expense 
the company s effective tax rate in is slightly lower than the rate primarily as a result of the phasing in of federal benefits for manufacturers in the rate in does not differ materially from expected statutory rates 
commitments and contingencies all dollars in thousands commitments under a number of indemnity agreements between the company and each of its officers and directors  the company has agreed to indemnify each of its officers and directors against any liability asserted against them in their capacity as an officer or director  or both 
the company s indemnity obligations under the indemnity agreements are subject to certain conditions and limitations set forth in each of the agreements 
under the terms of the agreement  the company is contingently liable for costs which may be incurred by the officers and directors in connection with claims arising by reason of these individuals roles as officers and directors 
the company has entered into salary continuation agreements with two employees  which provide for monthly payments to each of the employees or their designated beneficiary upon the employee s retirement or death 
the payment benefits range from per month to per month with the term of such payments limited to years after the employee s retirement at age the agreements also provide for survivorship benefits if the employee dies before attaining age  and severance payments if the employee is terminated without cause  the amount of which is dependent on the length of company service at the date of termination 
the net present value of the retirement payments is at december   of which is included in other long term liabilities  and the remaining current portion of in accrued liabilities  as one of the employees retired at the end of the december  liability of was all reported in other long term liabilities 
the company has obtained and is the beneficiary of three whole life insurance policies with respect to the two employees discussed above  and one other policy 
the cash surrender value of such policies included in other long term assets amounts to at december  and at december   respectively 
contingencies the company s general liability insurance policies are subject to deductibles or retentions  in amounts ranging from to  depending on policy year up to an aggregate amount 
the company is insured on a first dollar basis for workers compensation subject to statutory limits 
in the ordinary and normal conduct of our business  the company is subject to periodic lawsuits  investigations and claims collectively  the claims 
the company has in place commercial general liability insurance policies that cover the claims  including those alleging damages as a result of product defects 
although we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate resolution of the claims asserted against the company  the estimated liability for the claims  both in litigation and pre suit  are limited to the deductible amounts under those insurance policies 
those liabilities were estimated to be and  at december  and  respectively  and are included in other accrued liabilities 
the increase in from reflects additional deductible amounts anticipated to be paid with respect to new claims 
the company does not believe that the claims have legal merit  and is therefore vigorously defending those claims 
it is possible that additional claims may be filed against the company in the future  which could adversely impact the terms and pricing of the company s product liability insurance programs  possibly materially 
we do not believe that any currently pending claim to which the company is a party will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
warranty commitments gas transmission products such as those made by the company carry potentially serious personal injury risks in the event of failures in the field 
as a result  the company performs extensive internal testing and other quality control procedures  and historically due to the extensive nature of these quality controls the company has not had a meaningful failure rate in the field 
due to the company s quality systems  the warranty expense is de minimis  and accordingly  the company does not maintain a warranty reserve beyond a nominal amount 
future impact of known trends or uncertainties the company s operations are sensitive to a number of market factors  any one of which could materially adversely affect its results of operations in any given year construction activity the company is directly impacted by the level of single family and multi family residential housing starts and  to a lesser extent  commercial construction starts 
historically low interest rates and easy availability of credit  contributed to construction activity in recent years 
there are a number of factors in the current economy that are reducing the demand for residential  commercial and institutional construction 
these factors include the recent crisis in the financial markets has reduced the availability of financing for new construction  foreclosures have increased the inventory of available residential housing  thereby decreasing the demand for new construction  and consumer demand has declined as a result of reduced economic activity and increased unemployment 
initiatives taken by the federal government  such as the first time home owner credits in place during the th quarter of and the st quarter of  were aimed to help stabilize the residential housing markets and stimulate the short term economy 
those changes may however have a negative impact on future construction 
a significant reduction in residential construction activity may materially adversely affect the company s revenues 
technological changes although the hvac industry has historically been impacted by technology changes in a relatively incremental manner  it cannot be discounted that radical changes such as might be suggested by fuel cell technology  burner technology and or other developing technologies which might impact the use of natural gas could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations and or financial position in the future 
weather conditions the company s flagship tracpipe and counterstrike products are used in residential and commercial heating applications 
as such  the demand for its products is impacted by weather as it affects the level of construction 
furthermore  severe climatic changes  such as those suggested by the global climate change phenomenon  could over time adversely affect the demand for fossil fuel heating products and adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial position 
purchasing practices it has been the company s policy in recent years to aggregate purchase volumes for high value commodities with fewer vendors to achieve maximum cost reductions while maintaining quality and service 
this policy has been effective in reducing costs  but has introduced additional risk which could potentially result in short term supply disruptions or cost increases from time to time in the future 
supply disruptions and commodity risks the company uses a variety of materials in the manufacture of its products  including stainless steel  polyethylene and brass for its autoflare connectors 
in connection with the purchase of commodities  principally stainless steel for manufacturing requirements  the company occasionally enters into one year purchase commitments which include a designated fixed price or range of prices 
these agreements require the company to accept delivery of the commodity in the quantities committed  at the agreed upon prices 
transactions required for these commodities in excess of the one year commitments are conducted at current market prices at the company s discretion 
currently  the company does not have any fixed purchase commitment contracts  but may enter into such transactions in the future 
in addition to the raw material cost strategy described above  the company enters into fixed pricing agreements for the fabrication charges necessary to convert these commodities into useable product 
it is possible that prices may decrease below the fixed prices agreed upon and therefore require the company to pay more than market price  potentially materially 
management believes at present that it has adequate sources of supply for its raw materials and components subject to the risks described above under purchasing practices and has historically not had significant difficulty in obtaining the raw materials  component parts or finished goods from its suppliers 
the company is not dependent for any commodity on a single supplier  the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on its business 
interest rate sensitivity the company currently has access to a  line of credit loc with sovereign bank  na sovereign  but has no draws on the line outstanding at december   and therefore has no related interest rate risk 
however  if the company borrows against the loc  all amounts must be paid back with interest  using an interest rate range of libor plus to libor plus or prime less to prime plus  depending upon the company s then existing financial ratios 
the company may elect to use either the libor or prime rates 
as of december   the actual rate to borrow was at 
interest rates are also significant to the company as a participant in the residential construction industry  since interest rates can be a determinant factor on whether or not borrowing funds for building will be affordable to our customers 
see construction activity  above 
currently  interest rates are at historic lows  but any dramatic change to interest rates could have a detrimental effect on the business 
retention of qualified personnel the company does not operate with multiple levels of management 
it is relatively flat organizationally  which does subject the company to the risks associated with the loss of critical managers 
from time to time  there may be a shortage of skilled labor  which may make it more difficult and expensive for the company to attract and retain qualified employees 
the company is dependent upon the relatively unique talents and managerial skills of a small number of key executives 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates all dollars are in thousands financial reporting release no 
 released by the securities and exchange commission  requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the company s more significant accounting policies 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to revenue recognition  inventory valuations  goodwill and intangible asset valuations  product liability costs  phantom stock and accounting for income taxes 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
our critical accounting policies and significant estimates and assumptions are described in more detail as follows revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition activities relate almost entirely to the manufacture and sale of flexible metal hose and pipe 
under generally accepted accounting principles  revenues are considered to have been earned when the company has substantially accomplished what it must do to be entitled to the benefits represented by the revenues 
the following criteria represent preconditions to the recognition of revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement for the sale of product or services must exist 
delivery has occurred or services rendered 
the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable 
collection is reasonably assured 
the company generally recognizes revenue upon shipment in accordance with the above principles 
gross sales are reduced for all consideration paid to customers for which no identifiable benefit is received by the company 
this includes promotional incentives  year end rebates  and discounts 
the amounts of certain incentives are estimated at the time of sale 
commissions  for which the company receives an identifiable benefit  are accounted for as a sales expense 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost of inventories are determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
the company generally considers inventory quantities beyond two years usage  measured on a historical usage basis  to be excess inventory and reduces the gross carrying value of inventory accordingly 
goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with fasb asc topic intangibles goodwill of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  the company ceased recording amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives effective january  the company performed an annual impairment test in accordance with this guidance as of december  this analysis did not indicate any impairment of goodwill 
product liability reserves product liability reserves represent the estimated remaining payout for known claims against the company  and incurred but not reported claims for the current year 
the company uses historical data to project unreported claims 
as explained more fully under contingencies  for various product liability claims covered under the company s general liability insurance policies  the company must pay certain defense costs within its deductible or self insured retention limits  in amounts ranging from to  depending on the policy year  up to an aggregate amount 
the company is vigorously defending all known claims 
phantom stock the company uses the black scholes option pricing model as its method for determining fair value of the units 
the company uses the straight line method of attributing the value of the stock based compensation expense relating to the units 
the compensation expense including adjustment of the liability to its fair value from the units is recognized over the requisite service period of each grant or award 
the fasb asc topic stock compensation requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates in order to derive the company s best estimate of awards ultimately to vest 
forfeitures represent only the unvested portion of a surrendered unit and are typically estimated based on historical experience 
based on an analysis of the company s historical data  which has limited experience related to any stock based plan forfeitures  the company applied a forfeiture rate to plan units outstanding in determining its plan unit compensation expense for december  accounting for income taxes the company accounts for federal tax liabilities in accordance with asc topic  income taxes 
under this method the company recorded tax expense and related deferred taxes and tax benefits 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before the company is able to realize the benefit  or that future deductibility is uncertain 
liquidity and capital resources all dollars in thousands twelve months ended december  the company s cash balance at december  was  compared to  at december   which represents an increase of between periods 
the change is attributable to various components  as described below 
operating activities cash provided by operating activities was  lower in than in  being  and  respectively 
regarding significant cash outflows compared to  the company recognized a  cash depletion in related to inventory 
in the prior year  the company was able to purchase less inventory  as quantities on hand at the beginning of were higher than required to fulfill sales  a result of the general economic downturn 
in  inventory purchases went back to normal levels  however  the price of materials had increased for some core materials 
most notably  the price increased for nickel  which is a component of stainless steel and is used for many of the company s hose products  and the price of copper  a key ingredient in the company s brass fittings 
overall  inventory realizability has however actually improved  as evidenced by the ratio of inventory to quarterly cost of goods sold  which was and at the end of and  respectively 
accounts receivable was also a factor  as receipts went down  a good portion of the change was due to the decrease in sales from the fourth quarter of to the same quarter in  thus impacting the eventual cash collections during the succeeding year 
and although the company had an excellent sales month in december of  thus driving up the accounts receivable balance  cash deposits will not show until regarding the favorable components  accounts payable outflows were reduced by the bulk of the difference related to a unique raw material payment of  which was disbursed in the first quarter of accrued compensation required less cash 
this is the result of diminished results paid out in  versus much stronger results in  paid in also  accrued commissions and sales incentives produced  more cash  largely due to a higher payout in related to higher sales in the changes in other assets of related to various items including a portion connected to the timing of tax payments between periods 
investing activities cash from investing activities was  in versus  in this is largely a result of receiving  from our former parent company  mestek  on october   which we loaned to them in further details of the loan are contained in note  certain relationships and related party transactions 
capital spending was and in and  respectively 
financing cash used in financing activities during was  compared with  used in in  the company paid  in dividends  while also borrowing  from its line of credit to fund a portion of that payment 
the company paid the entire  of debt related to the loc in  as fully explained in note  line of credit 
on december   the company agreed to a new revolving line of credit note and loan agreement with sovereign 
the company established a line of credit facility in the maximum amount of  maturing in four years december   with funds available for working capital purposes and to fund dividends 
see note for a full description of terms and fees associated with the line 
the company believes its liquidity position as of december  is fully adequate to meet foreseeable future needs and that the company will possess adequate cash reserves to meet its day to day needs including any acquisitions  capital expenditures or stock repurchases it can reasonably foresee at this time 
recent accounting pronouncements asu  fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements this asu affects all entities that are required to make disclosures about recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements under fasb asc topic  originally issued as fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements 
the asu requires certain new disclosures and clarifies two existing disclosure requirements 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
off balance sheet obligations or arrangements the company has off balance sheet obligations or arrangements at december  that relate to purchase commitments and operating lease obligations totaling  the total amount of these obligations at december  was  item a quantitatative and qualitative market risks the company does not engage in the purchase or trading of market risk sensitive instruments
