item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
dollar amounts are in thousands except for per share amounts and where otherwise noted 

table of contents business and operational overview fastenal is a north american leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies 
we distribute these supplies through a network of approximately  company owned stores 
most of our customers are in the manufacturing and non residential construction markets 
the manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers oem and maintenance and repair operations mro 
the non residential construction market includes general  electrical  plumbing  sheet metal  and road contractors 
other users of our product include farmers  truckers  railroads  mining companies  federal  state  and local governmental entities  schools  and certain retail trades 
geographically  our stores and customers are primarily located in north america 
like most industrial and construction centric organizations  we have endured a roller coaster ride over the last several years 
the third quarter of included the final months of an inflationary period related to both steel prices approximately of our sales consist of some type of fastener nuts  bolts  screws  etc 
most of which are made of steel and energy prices a meaningful item for us given the amount of energy that is necessary in the production of our products and in the transportation of our products across north america in one of our over  vehicles on the road 
in the fourth quarter of  and throughout much of  this inflation turned to deflation 
when the swings are dramatic  this can hurt our gross margins because we are selling expensive inventory on the shelf at declining prices 
this hurt our gross margins in the drop in energy costs over the same period provided some relief  but it was small in comparison to the impact of deflation 
the deflation of ended and these conditions normalized and allowed our gross margins to partially recover in see later discussion on gross margins 
the discussion that follows includes information regarding our sales growth and our sales by product line during this information provides a summary view to understand the dynamics of the year 
however  we feel the real story is told in the monthly sales changes  sequential trends  and end market information that follow they explain the real impact of the market dynamics affecting us over this period of uncertainty 
as always  the pathway to profit is the cornerstone of our business evolution  and it influences everything we do 
remember  our business centers on our  stores their individual success leads to the success of the entire organization over time 
as you read the balance of this discussion you will see our stores were able to make great strides in their endeavor to dig out of the economic hole known as we will continue to work to complete this task and maintain our goal of growth through customer service 
sales growth net sales and growth rates in net sales were as follows net sales percentage change the increase in net sales in came primarily from higher unit sales 
our growth in net sales was not meaningfully impacted by deflationary or inflationary price changes in our products or by the introduction of new products or services 
the higher unit sales resulted primarily from increases in sales at older store locations discussed below and again later in this document and to a lesser degree the opening of new store locations in the last several years 
the growth in net sales at the older store locations was due to the moderating impacts of the current recessionary environment  an environment which dramatically worsened late in the increase in net sales also resulted from the strengthening of the canadian currency relative to the united states dollar and from our holo krome business  which we acquired in december these two items added approximately and percentage points  respectively  to our growth in the decrease in net sales in came primarily from lower unit sales  the decrease was amplified by deflationary price changes  particularly in our steel based products 
our sales change in was not meaningfully impacted by the introduction of new products or services 
the lower unit sales resulted primarily from decreases in sales at older store locations discussed below and again later in this document  this was partially offset by the opening of new stores in the last several years 
the decrease in sales at older store locations was directly related to the economic meltdown that occurred late in and the first part of 
table of contents the impact of the economy is best reflected in the growth performance of our stores opened greater than ten years ago store sites opened as follows group opened and earlier  group opened and earlier  and group opened and earlier and opened greater than five years ago store sites opened as follows group opened and earlier  group opened and earlier  and group opened and earlier 
these two groups of stores are more cyclical due to the increased market share they enjoy in their local markets 
the stores opened greater than two years ago represent a consistent same store view of our business store sites opened as follows group opened and earlier  group opened and earlier  and group opened and earlier 
the daily sales change for each of these groups was as follows store age opened greater than years opened greater than years opened greater than years note the age groups above are measured as of the last day of each respective year 
stores opened in contributed approximately  or to net sales 
stores opened in contributed approximately  or to net sales and approximately  or to net sales 
the rate of growth in sales of store locations generally levels off after they have been open for five years  and  as stated earlier  the sales generated at our older store locations typically vary more with the economy than do the sales of younger stores 
sales by product line the approximate mix of sales from the original fastener product line and from the other product lines was as follows fastener product line other product lines comments regarding monthly sales changes  sequential trends  and end market performance note daily sales are defined as the sales for the period divided by the number of business days in the period 
this section focuses on three distinct views of our business monthly sales changes  sequential trends  and end market performance 
the discussion of monthly sales changes provides a good mechanical view of our business based on the age of our stores 
the discussion of sales trends provides a framework for understanding the sequential trends that is  comparing a period to the immediately preceding period in our business since the market deteriorated late in finally  we believe the discussion regarding end market performance provides insight into activities with our various types of customers 
monthly sales changes stores opened greater than five years the impact of the economy  over time  is best reflected in the growth performance of our stores opened greater than five years store sites opened as follows group opened and earlier  group opened and earlier  and group opened and earlier 
this store group is more cyclical due to the increased market share these stores enjoy in their local markets

the improvement in generally continues the trend we saw in the latter half of the slow down in the final three months of and all of relate to the general economic weakness in the global marketplace 
several additional factors positively impacted our sales growth in the strengthening canadian dollar when compared to the united states dollar added approximately percentage points to our daily sales growth and our holo krome business  which we acquired in december  added approximately percentage points to our daily sales growth 
sequential trends we find it helpful to think about the monthly sequential changes in our business using the analogy of climbing a stairway this stairway has several predictable landings where there is a pause in the sequential gain ie april  july  and october to december  but generally speaking  climbs from january to october 
the october landing then establishes the benchmark for the start of the next year 
history has identified these landings in our business cycle 
they generally relate to months with impaired business days certain holidays 
the first landing centers on easter  which alternates between march and april easter occurred in april in both and  the second landing centers on july th  and the third landing centers on the approach of winter with its seasonal impact on primarily our construction business and with the christmas new year holidays 
the holidays we noted impact the trends because they either move from month to month or because they move around during the week 

table of contents the table below shows the pattern to our sequential change in our daily sales 
the line labeled past is an historical average of our sequential daily sales change for the period to we chose this time frame because it had similar characteristics  a weaker industrial economy in north america  and could serve as a benchmark for a possible trend line

past delta delta the january figures represent the percentage change from the previous october  whereas the remaining figures represent the percentage change from the previous month 
the drop from october to january represents the immediate impact of the economy on our business 
during this time frame  our daily sales change  on a year over year basis  dropped from growth in october to a contraction of in january 
after january  the trend continued downward as the delta or spread between the benchmark and the actual in february  march  and april averaged a negative 
the daily sales contraction  on a year over year basis  was in april 
the delta from may to july was not as significant  averaging a negative 
while this period was still painful  it began to show what we believe was the bottom of the drop 
finally  in the period from august to december  the delta improved  and averaged a positive 
during  sales have been strong our business exceeded the trend line in january  whereas february took a step back due to inclement weather  and march reestablished the trend of being at or above the trend line see graph below 
a graph of the sequential daily sales change pattern discussed above  starting with a base of in the previous october and ending with the next october  would be as follows logo end market performance fluctuations in end market business the sequential trends noted above were directly linked to fluctuations in our end markets 
to place this in perspective approximately of our business has historically been with customers engaged in some type of manufacturing 
the daily sales to these customers grew or contracted in the first  second  third  and fourth quarters when compared to the same quarter in the previous year  and for the year  as follows q q q q annual the growth was more pronounced in our industrial production business this is business where we supply products that become part of the finished goods produced by our customers and less pronounced in the maintenance 
table of contents portion of our manufacturing business this is business where we supply products that maintain the facility or the equipment of our customers engaged in manufacturing 
the contraction was more severe in our industrial production business and less severe in the maintenance portion of our manufacturing business 
our non residential construction customers have historically represented to of our business 
the daily sales to these customers grew or contracted in the first  second  third  and fourth quarters when compared to the same quarter in the previous year  and for the year  as follows q q q q annual on a sequential basis  the sales to our manufacturing customers stabilized in may and then started to demonstrate patterns that resemble historical norms 
this reversed the negative trend which began in october this stabilization and improvement was partially offset by continued deteriorization in our non residential construction business which weakened dramatically in the first eight months of  and then began to also demonstrate patterns that resemble historical norms 
a graph of the sequential daily sales trends to these two end markets in   and  starting with a base of in the previous october and ending with the next october  would be as follows logo logo 
table of contents pathway to profit and its impact on our business during april we disclosed our intention to alter the growth drivers of our business for most of the preceding ten years  we used store openings as the primary growth driver of our business our historical rate was approximately new stores each year 
as announced in april  we began to add outside sales personnel into existing stores at a faster rate than historical patterns 
we funded this sales force expansion with the occupancy savings generated by opening stores at the rate of to per year see our disclosure below regarding the temporary slowing of our store growth in and 
our goal was four fold to continue growing our business at a similar rate with the new outside sales investment model  to grow the sales of our average store to thousand per month in the five year period from to  to enhance the profitability of the overall business by capturing the natural expense leverage that has historically occurred in our existing stores as their sales grow  resulting in a growth of our pre tax earnings to of net sales by  and to improve the performance of our business due to the more efficient use of working capital primarily inventory as our average sales volume per store increases 
the economic weakness that dramatically worsened in the fall of and continued into caused us to alter the pathway to profit beginning in these changes centered on two aspects temporarily slowing new store openings to a range of to per year  and temporarily stopping headcount additions except for new store openings and for stores that are growing 
see later discussion on future store openings 
one side benefit of the pathway to profit initiative  described above  is a slow altering of our cost structure over the last several years to increase the portion of our operating costs that are variable versus fixed 
this dramatically improved our ability to manage through the economic environment of the last two years 
as discussed in our third quarter earnings release  we began to stabilize our store headcount in october from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of we grew our store average full time equivalent fte headcount from  to  or 
see later discussion on store count and fte numbers by quarter 
the pathway to profit initiative allows us to focus on the three drivers of our business store headcount  store or unit growth  and average sales volume per store  which ultimately drive our level of profitability 
our original goal was to hit the thousand per month store average  and grow our pre tax earnings to of net sales by we previously disclosed that we believed the duration of the economic weakness could delay the timing of when we achieve these goals by months 
however  as described below  we have now modified our thinking regarding our pre tax earnings goals 
during  we modified our thought process around the pathway to profit in two regards we have structurally lowered our cost structure and believe we can hit our profitability target in the pathway to profit initiative with average store sales of thousand per month by see evidence of this in our store size and profitability table later in this document and we decided to hire fewer store based people and instead added resources focused on specific opportunities  such as national accounts personnel and dedicated sales specialists manufacturing  government  industry focused  and automated solutions 
future store openings in july  we indicated our intentions to open to new stores during the second half of or an annualized rate of to 
during the second half of we opened stores 
in  we intend to open to new stores  or an annualized rate of to 

table of contents store count and full time equivalent fte headcount because of our pathway to profit  we increased both our store count opening and new stores in calendar and  respectively and our store fte headcount in and however  the rate of increase in store locations slowed we opened and new stores in calendar and  respectively and our fte headcount for all types of personnel was reduced when the economy weakened late in the number of stores at quarter end  the average headcount at our stores per quarter  the average fte headcount per quarter  and the percentage change were as follows for the first quarter of the last completed quarter before we began the pathway to profit  for the third quarter of our peak quarter before the economy weakened  and for each of the last five quarters q q q q q q q store locations quarter end count change twelve months change since q store personnel absolute headcount change twelve months change since q store personnel fte non store selling personnel fte sub total of all sales personnel fte distribution and manufacturing personnel fte administrative personnel fte sub total of non sales personnel fte total average fte headcount change twelve months store personnel fte non store selling personnel fte sub total of all sales personnel fte distribution and manufacturing personnel fte administrative personnel fte sub total of non sales personnel fte total average fte headcount change since q store personnel fte non store selling personnel fte sub total of all sales personnel fte distribution and manufacturing personnel fte administrative personnel fte sub total of non sales personnel fte total average fte headcount note the distribution and manufacturing headcount was impacted by the addition of employees with the acquisition of holo krome in december we have reduced our average fte headcount at our store locations since our peak of  average fte headcount in the third quarter of  much of this decrease relates to a reduction in part time hours worked as our average absolute headcount numbers related to store personnel declined by during this time period 

table of contents store size and profitability the store groups listed in the table below  when combined with our strategic account stores  represented approximately   and of our sales in the fourth quarter of   and  respectively 
strategic account stores are stores that are focused on selling to a group of strategic account customers in a limited geographic market 
our remaining sales approximately   and  respectively relate to either our in plant locations  our direct fastenal cold heading business including our holo krome business acquired in december  or our direct import business 
our average store had sales of   and  per month in the fourth quarter of   and  respectively 
this average amount was  per month in the first quarter of the last completed quarter before we began the pathway to profit 
the average age  number of stores  and pre tax earnings data by store size for the fourth quarter of   and  respectively  were as follows sales per month average age years number of stores percentage of stores pre tax earnings percentage three months ended december  to   to   to   to  over  strategic account store company total three months ended december  to   to   to   to  over  strategic account store company total three months ended december  to   to   to   to  over  strategic account store company total note amounts may not foot due to rounding difference 
our original intent under the pathway to profit was to increase the sales of our average store to approximately  per month see earlier discussion in order to meet our pre tax earnings profitability goal 
this would have shifted the store mix emphasis from the first three categories to   to  and  to  to the last three categories  to   to  and over  and we believe would have allowed us to leverage our fixed cost and increase our overall productivity 
our goal today is to continue to grow the business and to grow our pre tax earnings as a percent of net sales 
as stated earlier  we now believe  based on the profitability improvements noted in the previous table  that we can hit our pre tax earnings percent goal of with average store sales of approximately   per month 
note dollar amounts in this section are presented in whole dollars  not thousands 

table of contents statement of earnings information percentage of net sales for the years ended december twelve month period net sales gross profit operating and administrative expenses loss on sale of property and equipment operating income interest income earnings before income taxes note amounts may not foot due to rounding difference 
gross profit percentage for increased from  and the gross profit percentage for decreased from the gross profit percentage in the first  second  third and fourth quarters was as follows q q q q the fluctuations in our gross profit percentages are typically driven by transactional gross profit  organizational gross profit  and vendor incentive gross profit 
the transactional gross profit represents the gross profit realized due to the day to day fluctuations in customer pricing relative to product and freight costs 
this component was negatively influenced by the competitive landscape in which depressed the prices we could charge for our products 
this component has generally improved since august  except for customer mix which is discussed later 
the organizational gross profit represents the component of gross profit we attribute to buying scale and efficiency gains 
this component was negatively influenced by deflationary impacts in as we were selling inventory sourced at peak costs late in this component was magnified in due to the nature of our inventory turns and the dramatic decrease in sales activity during much of the year 
however  this component improved in the first  second  third  and fourth quarters of when compared to the fourth quarter of the third component relates to vendor volume allowances 
the gross profit dollars associated with this component dropped dramatically in the second half of however  this component improved in the first  second  third  and fourth quarters of when compared to the fourth quarter of in our second quarter earnings release  we indicated our belief that the first two components would continue to improve as we progress into the remainder of this belief was based on our focused effort to raise our transactional margin and the bias which we believed existed for some inflation in rather than the significant deflation we experienced in in the third quarter of  our assumptions about the latter half of the year were proven wrong and these two components had a negative impact on gross profit percentage 
we continued to struggle with the first component in the fourth quarter  but did see some improvement in the second component due to the expansion of inventory depth which decreased the need for fill in short term purchases to fill in an empty shelf  because normal procurement lead times do not meet demand buys which carry a cost premium 
the decrease in gross profit percentage  from the second quarter of to the third and fourth quarters of was primarily caused by the strong growth of our industrial production business  which resulted in a change in our overall business mix 
the industrial production business has a lower gross margin  therefore  the change in mix pulled our gross margin down 
however  since the operating expenses of our industrial production business are lower  operating income produced by that business is similar to our overall business 
the second cause was the relative lack of inflation in the third and fourth quarters 
finally  as we indicated in our second quarter earnings release  vendor volume allowances largely recovered during the second quarter to 
table of contents the levels in place in and in early due to the reset of vendor allowance programs which tend to be calendar based 
however  the fourth quarter of did see some improvement in this category 
generally speaking  the decline in the gross margin percentage from to was evenly split between a deterioration in the three components discussed earlier 
the improvement from to was primarily related to improvements in vendor incentive gross profit about half of the improvement  and the balance primarily related to improvements in organizational gross profit and transactional gross profit 
operating and administrative expenses improved relative to sales in versus both and historically  to of our operating and administrative expenses consist of employee related costs 
the components are payroll which includes cash compensation  stock option expense  and profit sharing  health care  and education 
during  this range had reduced to to due to the factors noted below 
during  this range moved back to the historical level 
the two largest components of employee related costs grew contracted as follows payroll cost health care cost the two largest components of operating and administrative expenses  outside of the employee related costs  grew contracted as follows occupancy selling transportation the disparity between the full time equivalent headcount increase of noted earlier and the annual increase in payroll costs noted above is driven by several factors sales commissions earned grew this increase was amplified by the sales growth and the gross margin expansion  both of which have a meaningful impact on the commissions earned  total bonuses earned increased due to our profit growth  hours worked per employee grew  and our profit sharing contribution grew 
these four items  when compared to  all grew at a rate faster than the rate of sales growth 
the disparity between the full time equivalent headcount decrease of noted earlier and the annual decrease in payroll costs noted above is driven by several factors sales commissions earned contracted this decrease was amplified by the sales contraction and the gross margin contraction  both of which have a meaningful impact on the commissions earned  total bonuses earned decreased due to our profit contraction  hours worked per employee contracted  and our profit sharing contribution was reduced to zero 
these four items  when compared to  all contracted at a rate faster than the rate of sales contraction 
our health care costs in decreased from the unusual peak in health care costs in and the first quarter of increased due to the increase in the percentage of employees opting for expanded coverage as their spouses lost their insurance coverage at other employers  increases in cobra costs due to changes in federal funding within cobra  and an increase in health care utilization when compared to previous years 
these conditions still exist in the second  third  and fourth quarters of  however  the spike in costs in the second  third  and fourth quarters of changed the comparison 
on a two year basis  our health care costs are still up significantly despite a decrease in headcount 

table of contents the two largest components of the remaining costs within our operating and administrative expenses include occupancy and selling transportation 
occupancy expenses increased from to and increased from to the annual increase in occupancy expense was driven by increases in utilities  increases in taxes  new store locations  expansions to our indianapolis and dallas distribution centers  and in the case of  our new holo krome facilities 
the selling transportation costs consist primarily of our store fleet as most of the distribution fleet costs are included in cost of sales 
selling transportation costs included in operating and administrative expenses decreased in both years due to fleet reductions  moderating fuel costs  and in the case of  improvements in the resale market for used fleet pickup prices 
the last several years have seen meaningful swings in the cost of diesel fuel and gasoline during the first  second  third  and fourth quarters of  our total vehicle fuel costs were approximately million  million  million  and million  respectively 
during the first  second  third  and fourth quarters of  our total vehicle fuel costs were approximately million  million  million  and million  respectively 
the changes resulted from variations in fuel costs  variations in the service levels provided to our stores from our distribution centers  and changes in the number of vehicles at our store locations 
these fuel costs include the fuel utilized in our distribution vehicles semi tractors  straight trucks  and sprinter trucks which is recorded in cost of goods and the fuel utilized in our store delivery vehicles which is included in operating and administrative expenses the split in the last several years has been approximately between distribution and store use 
the average per gallon fuel costs in actual dollars and the percentage change on a year over year basis for the last three years was as follows per gallon average price q q q q price diesel fuel gasoline price diesel fuel gasoline price diesel fuel gasoline per gallon price change q q q q change diesel fuel gasoline change diesel fuel gasoline loss on sale of property and equipment the loss on sale of property and equipment for and came primarily from the sale of used vehicles 
income taxes incomes taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes  were approximately   and for   and  respectively 
this rate fluctuates over time based on the income tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate  the level of profits in those jurisdictions  and changes in tax law and regulations in those jurisdictions 

table of contents net earnings net earnings  net earnings per share eps  percentage change in net earnings  and the percentage change in eps  were as follows dollar amounts net earnings basic eps diluted eps percentage change net earnings basic eps diluted eps during  the net earnings increase was greater than that of sales primarily due to the previously mentioned factors included in the discussion on the improvements in the gross margin percentage and in the growth in operating expenses which was dramatically less than sales growth 
during  the net earnings decrease was greater than that of sales primarily due to the previously mentioned factors in our gross margin discussion 
during  the net earnings growth rate was greater than that of net sales primarily because of the previously mentioned improvements in gross profit margins and disciplined management of our occupancy expenses 
the eps percentage change was better than that of net earnings due to the repurchase of shares in   and working capital two components of working capital  accounts receivable and inventories  are highlighted below 
the annual dollar change and the annual percentage change were as follows dollar change accounts receivable inventories annual percentage change accounts receivable inventories these two assets were impacted by our initiatives to improve working capital 
these initiatives include the establishment of a centralized call center to facilitate accounts receivable management this facility became operational early in and the disciplined management of all inventory amounts not identified as either expected store inventory  new expanded inventory  inventory necessary for upcoming store openings  or inventory necessary for our master stocking hubs 
the accounts receivable increase of from to was created by a daily sales increase of and in november and december  respectively 
the increase in accounts receivable was greater than the increase in daily sales 
this was primarily driven by the significant growth in both our national account large customer business and in our international business  both of which typically pay slower than our remaining business 
the accounts receivable decrease of from to relates to a daily sales decrease of and in november and december  respectively 
a portion of our inventory procurement has a longer lead time than our ability to foresee sales trends  therefore  the drop in sales growth activity in the fourth quarter of and during the first two months of resulted in inventory consumption that was less than the amount of inbound product 
the inventory decrease began in march and continued through most of our inventory dropped approximately   and  during the first  second  and third quarters of  respectively 
the inventory grew by approximately  in the 
table of contents fourth quarter of  approximately half of this increase related to our december acquisition of holo krome and the balance related to an increase in inventory stocking at our distribution centers to support the improving sales trends seen since august during  our inventory decreased approximately  in the first quarter  and increased approximately   and  in the second  third  and fourth quarters  respectively  or a  increase year to date 
this was disappointing to us  however  the expanding sales trends noted earlier in this discussion overshadowed the disappointment 
in its most simplified view  our expanding inventories are directly related to the expanding sales growth trends with emphasis on our large account business both oem mro  our confidence in their sustainability  and an increase in the rate of store openings 
as we indicated in earlier communications  our goal is to move the ratio of annual sales to accounts receivable and inventory annual sales ar i back to a better than a ratio 
on december  and  we had a ratio of acquisition on december   we purchased certain assets of a domestic manufacturer of socket products a type of fastener 
the business had an established name  holo krome  and has a good depth of knowledge and skill in its approximate employees 
the business did not have a meaningful impact on our financial results there were some balance sheet impacts of the all cash acquisition  as noted in our cash flow statement 
the acquisition did not have a material impact on our overall sales in liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows net cash provided of net earnings the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to increases in working capital due to our growth in sales 
the and increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the continued improvement in accounts receivable and inventory noted in the working capital discussion above 
the approximate percentage mix of inventory stocked at our stores versus our distribution center locations was as follows on december store distribution center total new stores open with the standard store model  which consists of a core stocking level of approximately thousand per location 
this inventory level grows as the level of business in a store grows 
net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows net cash used of net earnings 
table of contents property and equipment expenditures in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows net capital expenditures of net earnings the net cash used in investing activities was largely unchanged from to the net expenditures for property and equipment purchases less proceeds of disposals increased from to primarily due to increases for expansions at our indianapolis  indiana distribution center and related to increased spending for our fastenal automated solutions technology  which primarily consists of automated vending equipment 
the decrease in investing activities from is primarily due to the decrease in property and equipment expenditures 
this was primarily due to the reduction or elimination in of the cost related to the purchase of adjoining property in indianapolis  indiana and the relocation of our dallas  texas distribution center which occurred in  and the expansion of our indianapolis  indiana master distribution center which occurred in and the first half of this decrease was partially offset by an increase in purchase of short term marketable securities in the increase in investing activities was primarily due to the increase in property and equipment expenditures 
this was primarily due to the expansion of our indianapolis  indiana master distribution center  the purchase of adjoining property in indianapolis  indiana and the relocation of our dallas  texas distribution center noted above 
property and equipment expenditures in  and consist of purchase of software and hardware for fastenal s information processing systems  addition of certain pickup trucks  purchase of signage  shelving  and other fixed assets related to store openings  addition of manufacturing and warehouse equipment  expansion or improvement of certain owned or leased store properties  expansion of fastenal s distribution trucking fleet  cost related to the relocation of our new dallas  texas distribution center  cost related to the expansion of our indianapolis  indiana master distribution center   and  cost of a new manufacturing facility in rockford  illinois  cost of a new manufacturing facility for our holo krome business in wallingford  connecticut  and purchases related to our fastenal automated solutions technology  which primarily consists of automated vending equipment and 
disposals of property and equipment consist of the planned disposition of certain pick up trucks  semi tractors  and trailers in the normal course of business  the disposition of real estate relating to several store locations and  in the case of  the disposal of our former dallas  texas distribution center 
an estimate of our net capital expenditures and a recap of our net capital expenditures is provided below 
as of year end  we had no material outstanding commitments for capital expenditures 
we anticipate funding our current expansion plans with cash generated from operations  from available cash and cash equivalents  and  if necessary  from our borrowing capacity 
in addition to opening new stores in the united states  we plan to continue opening additional stores in our foreign markets 
net capital expenditures estimate actual manufacturing  warehouse and packaging equipment  dispensing equipment  and facilities shelving and related supplies for store openings and for product expansion at existing stores data processing software and equipment real estate and improvements to store locations vehicles proceeds from sale of property and equipment 
table of contents we have future commitments for facilities and equipment and for vehicles at year end 
the facility and vehicle amounts primarily consist of future lease payments 
the expected future cash obligations related to the commitments are as follows total after facilities and equipment vehicles total net cash used in financing activities net cash used in financing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows net cash used of net earnings the fluctuations are due to our changes in dividends and stock purchases over the three years 
these items in dollars and as a percentage of earnings were as follows dividends of net earnings stock purchases of net earnings total returned to shareholders of net earnings stock repurchase in july  our board of directors authorized purchases by us of up to  shares of our common stock 
this authorization replaced any unused authorization previously granted by the board of directors 
during  we purchased  shares of our outstanding stock at an average price of approximately per share 
these purchases occurred in the fourth quarter of we did not purchase any stock in as of february   we have remaining authority to purchase up to  additional shares of our common stock 
dividends we declared a dividend of per share on january  we paid aggregate annual dividends per share of   and in   and  respectively 
line of credit we have an  line of credit under which was outstanding at year end 
the line bears interest at over the libor rate 
we do not pay a fee for the unused portion of this line 
effects of inflation we noted minimal price changes in price deflation related to certain products negatively impacted net sales in price inflation related to certain products positively impacted net sales in critical accounting policies our estimates related to certain assets and liabilities are an integral part of our consolidated financial statements 
these estimates are considered critical because they require subjective and complex judgments

the reserve is based on an analysis of external data related to our historical claim reporting trends 
historically  results have reflected the reserves previously recorded 
we believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results 
general insurance reserve this reserve is for general claims related to workers compensation  property and casualty losses  and other self insured losses 
the reserve is based on an analysis of external data related to our historical general claim trends 
historically  results have reflected the reserves previously recorded 
we believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results 
tax strategies our effective income tax rate is based on income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
we establish income tax reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions if challenged may or may not result in us prevailing 
if we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit  based solely on the technical merits of the position  we recognize the benefit 
we measure the benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
we presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information 
we regularly monitor our tax positions and tax liabilities 
we re evaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit  or reverse a previously recorded tax benefit  when i there is a completion of a tax audit  ii there is a change in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance  or iii there is an expiration of the statute of limitations 
significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves 
although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities  positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective income tax rate in future periods 
legal reserves occasionally we are involved in legal matters 
the outcomes of these legal matters are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time 
in some actions  the claimants seek damages that could require significant expenditures 
we record a liability for these legal matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
if the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range  and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other  the minimum amount of the range is accrued 
if a loss is reasonably possible  but not known or probable  and can be reasonably estimated  the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in most cases  significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded 
although we believe we have adequately provided for probable losses from litigation  the ultimate outcome of litigation could be materially different from reserves recorded 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this update requires entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements and provides clarification of existing disclosure requirements 
for assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis  the asu requires disclosure of significant transfers between levels and  and transfers into and out of level of the fair value hierarchy and the reasons for those transfers 
significant transfers into each level must be disclosed and discussed separately from transfers out of each level 
significance is judged with respect to earnings  total assets  total liabilities or total equity 
an accounting policy must be determined and disclosed as to when transfers between levels are recognized actual date  beginning of period or end of period 
the asu amends the reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of level recurring fair value measurements to present information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross basis rather than as a net number 
the asu amends accounting standards codification asc to require fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities and clarifies that a description of the valuation technique and inputs used to measure fair value is required for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
this standard became effective in  except for the requirement to provide the level activity of purchases  sales  issuances and settlement on a gross basis  which will be effective beginning in the first quarter of since this standard impacts disclosure requirements only  its adoption will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 amendments to certain recognition and disclosure requirements 
this update amends guidance on subsequent events 
this amendment removes the requirement for sec filers to disclose the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events 
however  the date disclosure exemption does not relieve management of an sec filer from its responsibility to evaluate subsequent events through the date on which financial statements are issued 
this standard became effective in the first quarter of the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
proposed accounting pronouncements in recent exposure drafts  the international accounting standards board iasb and the fasb proposed a new approach to the accounting for leases 
from a lessee s perspective  the exposure drafts propose to abolish the distinction between operating and finance capital leases 
in its place  a right of use model would be used 
this proposal  as currently written  would require the lessee to recognize an asset for its right to use the underlying leased asset and a liability for its obligation to make lease payments 
this would lead to an increase in assets and liabilities for leases currently classified as an operating lease and could also lead to a change in timing as to when the expense is recognized 
this exposure draft is not yet finalized  however  we believe knowledge of this information is useful to the reader of our financial statements as many of our store locations and many of our vehicles are currently leased  and those leases are accounted for as operating leases 
geographic information information regarding our revenues and long lived assets by geographic area is set forth in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
risks related to our foreign operations are described earlier in this form k under the heading certain risks and uncertainties and item a 
risk factors 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to certain market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity pricing 
changes in these factors cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows 
we evaluate and manage exposure to these market risks as follows foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency fluctuations can affect our net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies 
our primary exchange rate exposure is with the canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
our estimated net earnings exposure for foreign currency exchange rates was not material at year end 
commodity steel pricing we buy and sell various types of steel products  these products consist primarily of different types of threaded fasteners 
during the last decade  there has been nominal movement in overall steel pricing  with some deflation occurring in the wake of the economic crisis of the far east markets that occurred in the late s 
this trend reversed to inflation in the period from late to the early part of and again from mid to the fall of since the fall of  there has been nominal inflation switching to deflation 
in  we noted minimal price changes except for stainless steel which did inflate 
stainless products represent approximately of our business 
we are exposed to the impacts of commodity steel pricing and our related ability to pass through the impacts to our end customers 
commodity fuel prices we have market risk for changes in gasoline and diesel fuel  however  this risk is mitigated in part by our ability to pass freight costs to our customers and the efficiency of our trucking distribution network
