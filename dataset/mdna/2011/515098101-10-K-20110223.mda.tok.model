landstar markets its freight transportation services and supply chain solutions primarily through independent commission sales agents and exclusively utilizes third party capacity providers to transport and store customers freight 
the nature of the company s business is such that a significant portion of its operating costs varies directly with revenue 
in the company s fiscal third quarter  the company completed the acquisitions of i national logistics management co 
together with a limited liability company and certain corporate subsidiaries and affiliates  nlm and ii a integration llc ai through ai acquisition llc  an entity which the company owns of the non voting  preferred interests and  from the time of acquisition through january   of the voting  common equity interests

in january  the company purchased the remaining of the voting  common equity interests in ai acquisition  llc 
these two acquisitions are referred to herein collectively as the recent acquisitions 
nlm and ai offer customers technology based supply chain solutions and other value added services on a fee for service basis 
nlm and ai are herein referred to as the acquired entities 
the results of operations from nlm and ai are presented as part of the company s transportation logistics segment 
landstar markets its freight transportation services and supply chain solutions primarily through independent commission sales agents who enter into contractual arrangements with the company and are responsible for locating freight  making that freight available to landstar s capacity providers and coordinating the transportation of the freight with customers and capacity providers 
the company s third party capacity providers consist of independent contractors who provide truck capacity to the company under exclusive lease arrangements the bco independent contractors  unrelated trucking companies who provide truck capacity to the company under non exclusive contractual arrangements the truck brokerage carriers  air cargo carriers  ocean cargo carriers  railroads and independent warehouse capacity providers warehouse capacity owners 
the company has contracts with all of the class domestic and canadian railroads and certain short line railroads and contracts with domestic and international airlines and ocean lines 
through this network of agents and capacity providers linked together by landstar s information technology systems  landstar operates a transportation services and supply chain solutions business primarily throughout north america with revenue of billion during the most recently completed fiscal year 
the company reports the results of two operating segments the transportation logistics segment and the insurance segment 

table of contents the transportation logistics segment provides a wide range of transportation services and supply chain solutions 
transportation services offered by the company include truckload and less than truckload transportation  rail intermodal  air cargo  ocean cargo  expedited ground and air delivery of time critical freight  heavy haul specialized  us canada and us mexico cross border  project cargo and customs brokerage 
supply chain solutions are based on advanced technology solutions offered by the company and include integrated multi modal solutions  outsourced logistics  supply chain engineering and warehousing 
also  supply chain solutions can be delivered through a software as a service model 
industries serviced by the transportation logistics segment include automotive products  paper  lumber and building products  metals  chemicals  foodstuffs  heavy machinery  retail  electronics  ammunition and explosives and military hardware 
in addition  the transportation logistics segment provides transportation services to other transportation companies  including logistics and less than truckload service providers 
each of the independent commission sales agents has the opportunity to market all of the services provided by the transportation logistics segment 
freight transportation services are typically charged to customers on a per shipment basis for the physical transportation of freight 
supply chain solution customers are generally charged fees for the services provided 
revenue recognized by the transportation logistics segment when providing capacity to customers to haul their freight is referred to herein as transportation services revenue and revenue for freight management services recognized on a fee for service basis is referred to herein as transportation management fees 
during  transportation services revenue hauled by bco independent contractors  truck brokerage carriers and rail intermodal  air cargo and ocean cargo carriers represented     and  respectively  of the company s transportation logistics segment revenue 
transportation management fees represented of the company s transportation logistics segment revenue in the insurance segment is comprised of signature insurance company  a wholly owned offshore insurance subsidiary  and risk management claim services  inc this segment provides risk and claims management services to certain of landstar s operating subsidiaries 
in addition  it reinsures certain risks of the company s bco independent contractors and provides certain property and casualty insurance directly to certain of landstar s operating subsidiaries 
revenue  representing premiums on reinsurance programs provided to the company s bco independent contractors  at the insurance segment represented approximately of the company s total revenue for changes in financial condition and results of operations management believes the company s success principally depends on its ability to generate freight through its network of independent commission sales agents and to efficiently deliver that freight utilizing third party capacity providers 
management believes the most significant factors to the company s success include increasing revenue  sourcing capacity and controlling costs 
while customer demand  which is subject to overall economic conditions  ultimately drives increases or decreases in revenue  the company primarily relies on its independent commission sales agents to establish customer relationships and generate revenue opportunities 
management s primary focus with respect to revenue growth is on revenue generated by independent commission sales agents who on an annual basis generate million or more of landstar revenue million dollar agents 
management believes future revenue growth is primarily dependent on its ability to increase both the revenue generated by million dollar agents and the number of million dollar agents through a combination of recruiting new agents and increasing the revenue opportunities generated by existing independent commission sales agents 
the following 
table of contents table shows the number of million dollar agents  the average revenue generated by these agents and the percent of consolidated revenue generated by these agents during the past three fiscal years fiscal year number of million dollar agents average revenue generated per million dollar agent percent of consolidated revenue generated by million dollar agents management monitors business activity by tracking the number of loads volume and revenue per load by mode of transportation 
revenue per load can be influenced by many factors other than a change in price 
those factors include the average length of haul  freight type  special handling and equipment requirements and delivery time requirements 
for shipments involving two or more modes of transportation  revenue is classified by the mode of transportation having the highest cost for the load 
the following table summarizes information by mode of transportation for the past three fiscal years fiscal year revenue generated through in thousands bco independent contractors truck brokerage carriers rail intermodal ocean cargo carriers air cargo carriers other number of loads bco independent contractors truck brokerage carriers rail intermodal ocean cargo carriers air cargo carriers revenue per load bco independent contractors truck brokerage carriers rail intermodal ocean cargo carriers air cargo carriers includes premium revenue generated by the insurance segment and warehousing and transportation management fee revenue generated by the transportation logistics segment 

table of contents also critical to the company s success is its ability to secure capacity  particularly truck capacity  at rates that allow the company to profitably transport customers freight 
the following table summarizes available truck capacity providers as of the end of the three most recent fiscal years dec 
 dec 
 dec 
 bco independent contractors truck brokerage carriers approved and active other approved total available truck capacity providers number of trucks provided by bco independent contractors active refers to truck brokerage carriers who moved at least one load in the days immediately preceding the fiscal year end 
the company incurs costs that are directly related to the transportation of freight that include purchased transportation and commissions to agents 
the company incurs indirect costs associated with the transportation of freight that include other operating costs and insurance and claims 
in addition  the company incurs selling  general and administrative costs essential to administering its business operations 
management continually monitors all components of the costs incurred by the company and establishes annual cost budgets which  in general  are used to benchmark costs incurred on a monthly basis 
purchased transportation represents the amount a bco independent contractor or other third party capacity provider is paid to haul freight 
the amount of purchased transportation paid to a bco independent contractor is primarily based on a contractually agreed upon percentage of revenue generated by the haul 
purchased transportation paid to a truck brokerage carrier is based on either a negotiated rate for each load hauled or a contractually agreed upon rate 
purchased transportation paid to rail intermodal  air cargo or ocean cargo carriers is based on contractually agreed upon fixed rates 
purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue for truck brokerage  rail intermodal and ocean cargo services is normally higher than that of bco independent contractor and air cargo services 
purchased transportation is the largest component of costs and expenses and  on a consolidated basis  increases or decreases in proportion to the revenue generated through bco independent contractors and other third party capacity providers  transportation management fees and revenue from the insurance segment 
purchased transportation as a percent of revenue also increases or decreases in relation to the availability of truck brokerage capacity  the price of fuel on revenue hauled by truck brokerage carriers and  to a lesser extent  on revenue hauled by railroads and air and ocean cargo carriers 
purchased transportation costs are recognized upon the completion of freight delivery 
commissions to agents are based on contractually agreed upon percentages of revenue or net revenue  defined as revenue less the cost of purchased transportation  or net revenue less a contractually agreed upon percentage of revenue retained by landstar 
commissions to agents as a percentage of consolidated revenue will vary directly with fluctuations in the percentage of consolidated revenue generated by the various modes of transportation  transportation management fees and revenue from the insurance segment and with changes in net revenue on services provided by truck brokerage carriers and rail intermodal  air cargo and ocean cargo carriers 
commissions to agents are recognized upon the completion of freight delivery 
the company s gross profit equals revenue less the cost of purchased transportation and commissions to agents 
gross profit divided by revenue is referred to as gross profit margin 
in general  gross profit margin on revenue hauled by bco independent contractors represents a fixed percentage of revenue due to the nature of the contracts that pay a fixed percentage of revenue to both the bco independent contractors and independent commission sales agents 
for revenue hauled by truck brokerage carriers  gross profit margin is either fixed or variable as a percent of revenue  depending on the contract with each individual independent commission 
table of contents sales agent 
under certain contracts with independent commission sales agents  the company retains a fixed percentage of revenue and the agent retains the amount remaining less the cost of purchased transportation the retention contracts 
gross profit margin on revenue hauled by rail  air cargo carriers  ocean cargo carriers and truck brokerage carriers  other than those under retention contracts  are variable in nature as the company s contracts with independent commission sales agents provide commissions to agents at a contractually agreed upon percentage of net revenue 
approximately of the company s revenue in had a fixed gross profit margin 
the company s operating margin is defined as operating income divided by gross profit 
maintenance costs for company provided trailing equipment  bco independent contractor recruiting costs and bad debts from bco independent contractors are the largest components of other operating costs 
potential liability associated with accidents in the trucking industry is severe and occurrences are unpredictable 
for commercial trucking claims  landstar retains liability up to  per occurrence 
the company also retains liability for each general liability claim up to   for each workers compensation claim and up to  for each cargo claim 
the company s exposure to liability associated with accidents incurred by truck brokerage carriers  rail intermodal capacity providers and air cargo and ocean cargo carriers who transport freight on behalf of the company is reduced by various factors including the extent to which they maintain their own insurance coverage 
a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents  cargo claims or workers compensation claims or the unfavorable development of existing claims could be expected to materially adversely affect landstar s results of operations 
employee compensation and benefits account for over half of the company s selling  general and administrative costs 
depreciation and amortization primarily relate to depreciation of trailing equipment  amortization of intangible assets attributed to the acquisitions in and depreciation of management information services equipment

legal matters as further described in periodic and current reports previously filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission the sec  the company and certain of its subsidiaries the defendants are defendants in a suit the litigation brought in the united states district court for the middle district of florida the district court by the owner operator independent drivers association  inc ooida and four former bco independent contractors the named plaintiffs and  with ooida  the plaintiffs on behalf of all independent contractors who provide truck capacity to the company and its subsidiaries under exclusive lease arrangements the bco independent contractors 
the plaintiffs allege that certain aspects of the company s motor carrier leases and related practices with its bco independent contractors violate certain federal leasing regulations and seek injunctive relief  an unspecified amount of damages and attorneys fees 
on march   the district court denied the request by plaintiffs for injunctive relief  entered a judgment in favor of the defendants and issued written orders setting forth its rulings related to the decertification of the plaintiff class and other important elements of the litigation relating to liability  injunctive relief and monetary relief 
the plaintiffs filed an appeal with the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit the appellate court of certain of the district court s rulings in favor of the defendants 
the defendants asked the appellate court to affirm such rulings and filed a cross appeal with the appellate court with respect to certain other rulings of the district court 
on september   the appellate court issued its initial ruling 
each of the parties to the litigation subsequently filed a petition with the appellate court seeking rehearing of the appellate court s ruling 
on october   the appellate court denied each of the motions for rehearing  withdrew its initial ruling and substituted a new ruling in its place 
the new ruling by the appellate court confirmed the absence of any violations alleged by the plaintiffs of the federal leasing regulations with respect to the written terms of all leases currently in use between the defendants and bco independent contractors 
in particular  the new ruling  among other things  held that i the defendants are not prohibited by the applicable federal leasing regulations from charging administrative or other fees to bco independent contractors in connection with voluntary programs offered by the defendants through which a bco independent contractor may purchase discounted products and services for a charge that is deducted against the compensation payable to the bco independent contractor a charge back deduction  ii in the case of a charge back deduction expressed as a flat fee in the lease  the applicable federal leasing regulations do not require defendants to do more than disclose the flat fee charge back deduction in the lease and follow up with settlement statements that explain the final amount charged back  iii the plaintiffs are not entitled to restitution or disgorgement with respect to violations by defendants of the applicable federal leasing regulations but instead may recover only actual damages  if any  which they sustained as a result of any such violations and iv the claims of bco 
table of contents independent contractors may not be handled on a class action basis for purposes of determining the amount of actual damages  if any  they sustained as a result of any violations 
however  the new ruling of the appellate court reversed the district court s ruling that an old version of the lease formerly used by defendants but not in use with any current bco independent contractor complied with applicable disclosure requirements under the federal leasing regulations with respect to adjustments to compensation payable to bco independent contractors on certain loads sourced from the us department of defense 
the appellate court then remanded the case to the district court to permit the plaintiffs to seek injunctive relief with respect to this violation of the federal leasing regulations and to hold an evidentiary hearing to give the named plaintiffs an opportunity to produce evidence of any damages they actually sustained as a result of such violation 
on december   the appellate court denied the plaintiffs petition seeking rehearing en banc of the appellate court s october  ruling 
the defendants anticipate that the plaintiffs will petition the united states supreme court to seek to further appeal all or a portion of the appellate court s october  ruling  however  there can be no assurance as to the outcome of any such petition 
although no assurances can be given with respect to the outcome of the litigation  including any possible award of attorneys fees to the plaintiffs  the company believes that i no plaintiff has sustained any actual damages as a result of any violations by the defendants of the federal leasing regulations and ii injunctive relief  if any  that may be granted by the district court on remand is unlikely to have a material adverse financial effect on the company 
the company is involved in certain other claims and pending litigation arising from the normal conduct of business 
based on knowledge of the facts and  in certain cases  opinions of outside counsel  management believes that adequate provisions have been made for probable losses with respect to the resolution of all such other claims and pending litigation and that the ultimate outcome  after provisions therefor  will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company  but could have a material effect on the results of operations in a given quarter or year 
critical accounting policies and estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts for both trade and other receivables represents management s estimate of the amount of outstanding receivables that will not be collected 
historically  management s estimates for uncollectible receivables have been materially correct 
although management believes the amount of the allowance for both trade and other receivables at december  is appropriate  a prolonged period of low or no economic growth may adversely affect the collection of these receivables 
conversely  a more robust economic environment may result in the realization of some portion of the estimated uncollectible receivables 
landstar provides for the estimated costs of self insured claims primarily on an actuarial basis 
the amount recorded for the estimated liability for claims incurred is based upon the facts and circumstances known on the applicable balance sheet date 
the ultimate resolution of these claims may be for an amount greater or less than the amount estimated by management 
the company continually revises its existing claim estimates as new or revised information becomes available on the status of each claim 
historically  the company has experienced both favorable and unfavorable development of prior year claims estimates 
during fiscal years  and  insurance and claims costs included   and  respectively  of favorable adjustments to prior years claims estimates 
it is reasonably likely that the ultimate outcome of settling all outstanding claims will be more or less than the estimated claims reserve at december  the company utilizes certain income tax planning strategies to reduce its overall cost of income taxes 
upon audit  it is possible that certain strategies might be disallowed resulting in an increased liability for income taxes 
certain of these tax planning strategies result in a level of uncertainty as to whether the related tax positions taken by the company will result in a recognizable benefit 
the company has provided for its estimated exposure attributable to such tax positions due to the corresponding level of uncertainty with respect 
table of contents to the amount of income tax benefit that may ultimately be realized 
management believes that the provision for liabilities resulting from the uncertainty in such income tax positions is appropriate 
to date  the company has not experienced an examination by governmental revenue authorities that would lead management to believe that the company s past provisions for exposures related to the uncertainty of such income tax positions are not reasonably appropriate 
the company tests for impairment of goodwill at least annually  typically in the fourth quarter  based on a two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow model and market approach 
the model includes a number of significant assumptions and estimates including future cash flows and discount rates 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value under the first step of the impairment test  then the second step is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
only the first step of the impairment test was required in as the estimated fair value of the reporting units significantly exceeded carrying value 
significant variances from management s estimates for the amount of uncollectible receivables  the ultimate resolution of self insured claims  the provision for uncertainty in income tax positions and impairment of goodwill can all be expected to positively or negatively affect landstar s earnings in a given quarter or year
