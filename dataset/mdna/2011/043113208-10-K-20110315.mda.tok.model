item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our profitability is primarily attributable to the sale of water by artesian water 
gross water sales in artesian water comprise of total operating revenues 
our profitability is also attributed to the various contract operations  water and sewer service line protection plans and other services we provide 
water sales are subject to seasonal fluctuations  particularly during summer when water demand may vary with rainfall and temperature 
in the event temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than expected  or rainfall is greater than expected  the demand for water may decrease and our revenues may be adversely affected 
we believe the effects of weather are short term and do not materially affect the execution of our strategic initiatives 
our contract operations and other services provide a revenue stream that is not affected by changes in weather patterns 
while water sales revenues are our primary source of revenues  we continue to seek growth opportunities to provide wastewater service in delaware  maryland and the surrounding areas 
we also continue to explore and develop relationships with developers and municipalities in order to increase revenues from contract water and wastewater operations  wastewater management services  design  construction and engineering services 
we plan to continue developing and expanding our contract operations and other services in a manner that complements our growth in water service to new customers 
our anticipated growth in these areas is subject to changes in residential and commercial construction  which may be affected by interest rates  inflation and general housing and economic market conditions 
we anticipate continued growth in our non regulated division due to our water and sewer service line protection plans 
we will continue to focus attention on expanding our contract operations opportunities with municipal and government water providers in delaware and surrounding areas 
water division overview artesian water  artesian water maryland and artesian water pennsylvania provide water service to residential  commercial  industrial  governmental  municipal and utility customers 
increases in the number of customers served contributed to increases in our operating revenue 
the town of middletown  which is one of our municipal customers and is located in southern new castle county  delaware  has nearly doubled in population since  and population growth in this area is expected to continue for some time as a result of ongoing and future residential construction 
as population growth continues in middletown and other areas in delaware  we believe that the demand for water will increase  thereby contributing to an increase in our operating revenues 
as of december   we had approximately  metered water customers in delaware  an increase of approximately  compared to december  the number of metered water customers in maryland increased by approximately compared to  and the number of metered water customers in pennsylvania remained consistent with operational highlights in december  artesian water maryland signed an agreement  or the port deposit purchase agreement  to purchase all of the assets used in providing potable water  water distribution and water meter services  or the facilities  from the town of port deposit  maryland  or port deposit

non regulated division overview artesian utility provides contract water and wastewater operation services to private  municipal and governmental institutions 
artesian utility currently operates wastewater treatment facilities for the town of middletown  in southern new castle county  or middletown  under a year contract that expires on february  the facilities include two wastewater treatment stations with capacities of up to approximately mgd and  gallons per day  respectively 
we also operate a wastewater disposal facility in middletown in order to support the mgd wastewater facility 
one of the wastewater treatment facilities in middletown now provides reclaimed wastewater for use in spray irrigation on public and agricultural lands in the area 
our relationship with the town of middletown has given us the opportunity to create the artesian water resource management partnership  or awrmp  to encourage and support the use of reclaimed water for agricultural irrigation and other needs 
using reclaimed water to irrigate farm fields can save the delmarva region millions of gallons of groundwater each day 
the awrmp s first project in middletown will save up to million gallons of water per day during the peak growing season 
through the awrmp initiative  artesian will provide planning  engineering and technical expertise and help bring together the various state  local and private partners needed for water recycling project approvals 
artesian development is a real estate holding company that owns properties  including land zoned for office buildings  a water treatment plant and wastewater facility  as well as property for current operations  including the recent purchase of an office facility as described below 
artesian consulting engineers provides an array of engineering services to developers  private residential clients  commercial clients and municipal clients 
in june  artesian consulting engineers acquired all the assets of meridian  which included the assignment of certain current contract agreements to provide engineering services to developers and includes services to be provided to artesian water 
operational highlights artesian utility has an agreement with the cecil county public works in cecil county  maryland to operate the meadowview wastewater and highlands wastewater treatment and disposal facilities until artesian wastewater maryland s purchase of the facilities is closed 
this agreement also employs artesian utility to operate two water supply and treatment stations and two booster stations in cecil county 
in october  artesian development purchased an office facility located in sussex county  delaware 
the facility consists of approximately  square feet of office space along with nearly  square feet of warehouse space 
this facility allows all of our sussex county  delaware operations to be housed in one central location 

table of contents protection plans in addition to services discussed above  artesian resources initiated a water service line protection plan  or wslp plan  in march the wslp plan covers all parts  material and labor required to repair or replace participating customers leaking water service lines up to an annual limit 
as of december   approximately  or  of our eligible water customers had signed up for the wslp plan 
the wslp plan was expanded in the second quarter of to include maintenance or repair to customers sewer lines 
this plan  the sewer service line protection plan  or sslp plan  covers all parts  material and labor required to repair or replace participating customers leaking or clogged sewer lines up to an annual limit 
as of december   approximately  or  of our eligible customers had signed up for the sslp plan 
also  in the second quarter of  the wslp plan and sslp plan were extended to include non customers of artesian resources 
as of december   approximately non customer participants have signed up for either the wslp plan or sslp plan 
strategic direction our strategy is to significantly increase customer growth  revenues  earnings and dividends by expanding our water  wastewater  service line protection plan and engineering services across the delmarva peninsula 
we remain focused on providing superior service to our customers and continuously seeking ways to improve our efficiency and performance 
by providing water  wastewater and engineering services  we believe we are positioned as the primary resource for developers and communities throughout the delmarva peninsula seeking to fill both needs simultaneously 
we have a proven ability to acquire and integrate high growth  reputable entities  through which we have captured additional service territories that will serve as a base for future revenue 
with recent acquisitions  we have successfully integrated their operations  infrastructure  technology and employees 
we believe this experience presents a strong platform for further expansion and that our success to date also produces positive relationships and credibility with regulators  municipalities  developers and customers in both existing and prospective service areas 
in our regulated water division  our strategy is to focus on a wide spectrum of activities  which include identifying new and dependable sources of supply  developing the wells  treatment plants and delivery systems to supply water to customers and educating customers on the wise use of water 
our strategy includes focused efforts to expand in new regions added to our delaware service territory over the last years 
in addition  we believe growth will occur in the maryland counties on the delmarva peninsula 
we plan to expand our regulated water service area in the cecil county designated growth corridor and to expand our business through the design  construction  operation  management and acquisition of additional water systems 
the expansion of our exclusive franchise areas elsewhere in maryland and the award of additional contracts will similarly enhance our operations within the state 
we believe that delaware generally lower cost of living in the region  availability of development sites in relatively close proximity to the atlantic ocean in sussex county  and attractive financing rates for construction and mortgages have resulted  and will continue to result  in increases to our customer base 
delaware s lower property and income tax rate make it an attractive region for new home development and retirement communities 
substantial portions of delaware are currently not served by a public water system  which could also assist in an increase to our customer base as systems are added 
according to the united states census bureau  delaware population increased an estimated from to  as compared to the nationwide growth rate of approximately 
in our regulated wastewater division  we foresee significant growth opportunities and will continue to seek strategic partnerships and relationships with developers and municipalities to complement existing agreements for the provision of wastewater service on the delmarva peninsula 
artesian wastewater completed an agreement with georgetown  delaware in july to provide wastewater treatment and disposal services for georgetown s growth and annexation areas 
artesian wastewater will provide up to mgd of wastewater capacity for the town 
the preliminary engineering and design work was completed on a regional wastewater treatment and disposal facility located in the northern sussex county area that has the potential to treat up to approximately mgd 
this facility is strategically situated on acres to provide service to the growing population in the georgetown  ellendale and milton areas  as well as to neighboring municipal systems 
this facility was granted conditional use approval by sussex county council to serve the elizabethtown subdivision of approximately  homes and  square feet of proposed commercial space  as well as seven additional projects comprising approximately  residential units 
the facility will also be capable of offering wastewater services to local municipalities 
artesian wastewater will manage the design and construction of the facility and  once constructed  the operation of the facility 
artesian wastewater maryland signed two agreements in october with cecil county for the purchase of specific wastewater facilities 
the closing of these transactions is delayed until a final judicial determination is received on the petition filed by the appleton alliance as further described in item of this form k under the heading subsidiaries artesian water maryland 
closing on these transactions is also subject to the approval of the maryland public service commission  or mdpsc 
once completed  these acquisitions will add four wastewater facilities to our service area 
the general need for increased capital investment in our water and wastewater systems is due to a combination of population growth  more protective water quality standards and aging infrastructure 
our capital investment plan for the next five years includes projects for water and wastewater treatment plant improvements and additions in both delaware and maryland 
capital improvements are planned and budgeted to meet anticipated changes in regulations and needs for increased capacity related to projected growth 
the delaware public service commission and maryland public service commission have generally recognized the operating and capital costs associated with these improvements in setting water and wastewater rates for current customers and capacity charges for new customers 

table of contents in our non regulated division  we are actively pursuing opportunities to expand our contract operations 
in artesian utility  we will seek to expand our contract design and construction services of water and wastewater facilities for developers  municipalities and other utilities and will continue to actively pursue water and wastewater operation contracts with municipalities across the delmarva peninsula 
artesian development owns two nine acre parcels of land  located in sussex county  delaware  which will allow for construction of a water treatment facility and wastewater treatment facility 
artesian consulting engineers continues to provide an array of civil engineering  land surveying and architectural work for public and private residential  commercial and municipal clients  including artesian resources 
we believe these engineering services will continue to provide a revenue stream that is not weather sensitive  while also providing additional opportunities for artesian resources 
in addition  artesian consulting engineers provides artesian resources with enhanced design and engineering capabilities that we believe decrease our reliance on outside engineering firms for similar services 
inflation we are affected by inflation  most notably by the continually increasing costs required to maintain  improve and expand our service capability 
the cumulative effect of inflation results in significantly higher facility costs compared to investments made to years ago  which must be recovered from future cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are those we believe are most important to portraying the financial condition and results of operations and also require significant estimates  assumptions or other judgments by management 
the following provides an overview of the accounting policies that are particularly important to the results of operations and financial condition of the company 
changes in the estimates  assumptions or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the financial statements in any quarterly or annual period 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgment that is involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
senior management has discussed the selection and development of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
all additions to plant are recorded at cost 
cost includes direct labor  materials  and indirect charges for such items as transportation  supervision  pension  medical  and other fringe benefits related to employees engaged in construction activities 
when depreciable units of utility plant are retired  the cost of retired property  together with any cost associated with retirement and less any salvage value or proceeds received  is charged to accumulated depreciation 
maintenance  repairs  and replacement of minor items of plant are charged to expense as incurred 
we record water service revenue  including amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts  based upon estimated usage from the date of the last meter reading to the end of the accounting period 
as actual usage amounts are received  adjustments are made to the unbilled estimates in the next billing cycle based on the actual results 
estimates are made on an individual customer basis  based on one of three methods the previous year s consumption in the same period  the previous billing period s consumption  or trending and are adjusted to reflect current changes in water demand on a system wide basis 
while actual usage for individual customers may differ materially from the estimate  we believe the overall total estimate of consumption and revenue for the fiscal period will not differ materially from actual billed consumption  as the overall estimate has been adjusted to reflect any change in overall demand on the system for the period 
we record accounts receivable at the invoiced amounts 
the reserve for bad debts is the company best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
the company reviews the reserve for bad debts on a quarterly basis 
account balances are written off against the reserve when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
our regulated utilities record deferred regulatory assets under fasb asc topic  which are costs that may be recovered over various lengths of time as prescribed by the depsc  mdpsc and papuc 
as the utility incurs certain costs  such as expenses related to rate case applications  a deferred regulatory asset is created 
adjustments to these deferred regulatory assets are made when the depsc  mdpsc or papuc determines whether the expense is recoverable in rates  the length of time over which an expense is recoverable  or  because of changes in circumstances  whether a remaining balance of deferred expense is recoverable in rates charged to customers 
adjustments to reflect changes in recoverability of certain deferred regulatory assets may have a material effect on our financial results 
our long lived assets consist primarily of utility plant in service and regulatory assets 
we review for impairment of our long lived assets  including utility plant in service  in accordance with the requirements of fasb asc topic we review regulatory assets for the continued application of fasb asc topic our review determines whether there have been changes in circumstances or events that have occurred that require adjustments to the carrying value of these assets 
adjustments to the carrying value of these assets would be made in instances where changes in circumstances or events indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the company believes there are no impairments in the carrying amounts of its long lived assets at december
