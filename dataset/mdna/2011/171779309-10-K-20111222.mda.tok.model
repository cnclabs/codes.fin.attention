global market conditions and competitive landscape the sustained period of macroeconomic weakness and volatility in the global economy and in capital markets has resulted in heightened uncertainty and cautious customer behavior in our industry and markets 
these dynamics have caused increased customer scrutiny with respect to network investment  which has resulted in protracted sales cycles  lengthier network deployments  revenue recognition delays and extended collection cycles  particularly for international network projects 
broad macroeconomic weakness has previously resulted in periods of decreased demand for our products and services that have adversely affected our results of operations 
we remain uncertain as to how long current macroeconomic and industry conditions will persist  the pace of any recovery  and the magnitude of the effect of these conditions on the growth of our markets and business  as well as our results of operations 
we continue to encounter a highly competitive marketplace for sales of our networking solutions offering  particularly within our packet optical transport segment 
competition has intensified as we and our competitors have introduced new  high capacity  high speed network solutions and more aggressively sought to capture market share and displace incumbent vendors at large carrier customers 
we have also encountered increased competition as we have expanded our business in emerging geographies and new markets or applications for our communications networking products 
for example  we have made early progress in the sale of our products for application in submarine networks and with sales to customers in the middle east 
in this competitive environment  securing new opportunities  particularly in international markets  often requires that we agree to less favorable commercial terms or pricing  financial commitments requiring collateralized performance bonds or similar instruments that place cash resources at risk  and other contractual commitments that place a disproportionate allocation of risk upon the vendor 
these terms can adversely affect our result of operations 
we expect the level of competition  particularly in north america  to continue and potentially increase  as chinese equipment vendors seek to gain entry into the us market  and other multinational competitors seek to retain incumbent positions with large customers in the region 
potential supply chain disruption in recent months  several regions of thailand have experienced severe flooding  causing significant damage to infrastructure and factories 
flooding has affected the operations of certain component providers in our supply chain  or  in turn  their suppliers of components based in thailand 
we are actively monitoring and evaluating stabilization efforts of these suppliers following the flooding and are currently working with existing suppliers and qualifying new sources of supply in order to minimize the effect on our customers and our business 
given the severity of the situation and our dependency upon the recovery efforts of these suppliers  however  there can be no assurance that we will not encounter shortages  extended lead 
table of contents times  additional costs or other disruptions in the availability or allocation of components that could affect our business over the next several fiscal quarters 
market opportunity and strategy despite recent macroeconomic and competitive dynamics  we believe that a number of important underlying drivers represent significant long term opportunities and growing demand for converged optical ethernet networking solutions in our target markets 
we believe that market trends  including the proliferation of smartphones  tablets and similar devices running mobile web applications  the prevalence of video applications  and the shift of enterprise and consumer applications to cloud based or virtualized network environments are emblematic of increased use and dependence by consumers and enterprises upon a growing variety of broadband applications and services 
we expect that these services will continue to add significant multiservice network traffic  requiring our customers to invest in next generation  high capacity network infrastructures that are more efficient  robust and dynamic 
to capitalize on the market dynamics above  we invested heavily in our business during fiscal and are in the process of introducing  or transitioning to new solutions offerings in each of our product segments 
simultaneously  we have been investing in market entry into multiple new geographies and customer segments  as well as the expansion of footprint and market share within our traditional customer base across our segments 
we have also been making investments in an effort to optimize and gain leverage from our business processes  systems  infrastructure and resources in order to achieve our desired operating model and profitability goals 
these investments are a critical element of our effort to address customer business challenges and evolving network requirements and position us to seize market opportunities 
we believe these investments  together with the successful completion of significant integration activities relating to the men business during fiscal  lay a strong foundation for long term growth of our business 
additional components of our overall corporate strategy can be found in item  business above 
acquisition of nortel metro ethernet networks business and effect on results of operations and financial condition on march   we completed our acquisition the men acquisition of substantially all of the optical networking and carrier ethernet assets of nortel metro ethernet networks business the men business for a purchase price of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this annual report for more information 
the men acquisition represented a transformative opportunity for ciena  strengthening our position as a leader in next generation  converged optical ethernet networking and accelerating the execution of our corporate and research and development strategies 
due to the relative scale of its operations  however  the men acquisition materially affected our operations  financial results and liquidity during the periods covered in this report and may make period to period comparisons difficult 
these effects include in fiscal  we paid the million purchase price for the men acquisition in cash and issued million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due march   in part to fund the purchase price  our revenue increased materially as compared to periods prior to the men acquisition  which closed during our second quarter of fiscal  our concentration of packet optical transport revenue and revenue from outside of the united states increased  each of which has contributed to somewhat lower gross margins since the men acquisition  gross margin was adversely affected by the valuation  required under accounting rules  of the acquired finished goods inventory of the men business to fair value upon closing 
this valuation increased marketable inventory carrying value by million  of which million and million were recognized in cost of goods sold during fiscal and  respectively 
see critical accounting policies and estimates long lived assets and note of the consolidated financial statements found under item of part ii of this annual report  our operating expense increased materially compared to periods prior to the men acquisition  reflecting the addition of approximately  employees  nearly doubling our headcount  increased operating costs associated with a significantly expanded  global business  increased amortization costs relating to the acquisition of million in intangible assets  transition service expense for services performed by a nortel affiliate through the second quarter of fiscal  relating to finance and accounting functions  supply chain and logistics management  maintenance 
table of contents and product support  order management and fulfillment  trade compliance  and information technology  integration related costs  including transaction  consulting and third party service fees  severance and purchases of capitalized information technology equipment of million and million for fiscal and  respectively  and restructuring costs during fiscal and fiscal of approximately million and million  respectively  largely related to our efforts to better align our workforce and operating costs with the market opportunities  product development initiatives and business strategies for the combined operations 
increased use of cash from operations primarily driven by greater working capital requirements in fiscal and in reviewing our financial results  investors should consider these and other factors included to highlight challenges to period to period comparisons 
financial results revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal was million  representing a sequential increase of from million in the third quarter of fiscal revenue related details reflecting sequential changes from the third quarter of fiscal include product revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal increased by million  primarily reflecting an increase of million in packet optical transport and a decrease of million in sales of carrier ethernet solutions 
service revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal increased by million 
revenue from the united states for the fourth quarter of fiscal was million  an increase from million in the third quarter of fiscal international revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal was million  a decrease from million in the third quarter of fiscal as a percentage of revenue  international revenue was during the fourth quarter of fiscal  a decrease from during the third quarter of fiscal for the fourth quarter of fiscal  one customer accounted for greater than of revenue  representing of total revenue 
this compares to one customer that accounted for of total revenue in the third quarter of fiscal gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal was  a decrease from in the third quarter of fiscal gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal was adversely affected by lower services margin 
gross margin has been  and may continue to be  affected by increased competitive pressures across our segments and our strategy to gain new customers  enter new markets and capture additional market share  particularly for g and g coherent optical transport solutions within our packet optical platform 
operating expense was million for the fourth quarter of fiscal  an increase from million in the third quarter of fiscal fourth quarter operating expense primarily reflects a million increase in selling and marketing expense due to increased variable compensation  travel expense and product demonstration costs 
this increase was partially offset by decreases of million in acquisition and integration costs and million in research and development expense 
as a result of our increase in revenue as described above  our loss from operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal was million  an improvement from a million loss from operations during the third quarter of fiscal our net loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal was million  or per share 
this compares to a net loss of million or per share  for the third quarter of fiscal we generated million in cash from operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal  consisting of million provided by net losses adjusted for non cash charges and million in changes in working capital 
this compares with the use of million in cash from operations during the third quarter of fiscal  consisting of million in cash used for changes in working capital and million from net losses adjusted for non cash charges 
as of october   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million of long term investments in 
table of contents us treasury securities 
this compares to million and million in cash and cash equivalents at july  and october   respectively  and million of long term investments in us treasury securities at july  as of october  and july   headcount was  an increase from  and  at october  and  respectively 
consolidated results of operations our results of operations for the periods in fiscal reflect the operations of the men business beginning on the march  acquisition date 
we reorganized our internal organizational structure and the management of our business upon the men acquisition and  as described in note of the consolidated financial statements found under item of part ii of this report  present our results of operations based upon the following operating segments packet optical transport includes optical transport solutions that increase network capacity and enable more rapid delivery of a broader mix of high bandwidth services

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal revenue the table below in thousands  except percentage data sets forth the changes in our operating segment revenue for the periods indicated fiscal year increase decrease revenue packet optical transport packet optical switching carrier ethernet solutions software and services consolidated revenue denotes of total revenue denotes change from to packet optical transport revenue increased reflecting a million increase in sales of our packet optical platform  largely driven by service provider demand for high capacity  optical transport  including coherent g and g network infrastructures 
packet optical transport revenue also benefited from sales increases of million in advanced services platform  million in multiservice optical platform  million in advanced services platform  and million in cpl 
these increases were partially offset by decreases of million in corestream agility optical transport system and million in legacy transport products 
packet optical switching revenue increased reflecting a million increase in sales of our reconfigurable switching system and a million increase in sales of our coredirector multiservice optical switches 
packet optical switching revenue has historically reflected sales of our coredirector platform  which has a concentrated customer base 
our packet optical switching segment is in the midst of a platform transition to our next generation reconfigurable switching system 
as a result of these factors  revenue for this segment can fluctuate considerably depending upon individual customer purchasing decisions and the level of initial deployments with customers 
carrier ethernet solutions revenue decreased reflecting a million decrease in sales of our and families of service delivery switches and service aggregation switches and an million decrease in sales of our legacy metro ethernet and broadband products 
carrier ethernet service delivery revenue benefited from million in initial revenue from the introduction of the service aggregation switch to support wireless backhaul  ethernet business services and residential broadband applications 
revenue for this segment remains subject to fluctuation due to customer concentration and the timing of customer purchasing and deployment cycles 
we expect segment results to be dependent upon further adoption of these products to support business ethernet service applications and the level of customer adoption of our high capacity  carrier ethernet configuration for our service aggregation switch to support wireless backhaul  ethernet business services and residential broadband applications 
software and services revenue increased reflecting a million increase in maintenance support revenue and a million increase in installation  deployment and consulting services 
revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states is reflected as international in the geographic distribution of revenue below 
the table below in thousands  except percentage data sets forth the changes in geographic distribution of revenue for the periods indicated 
table of contents fiscal year increase decrease united states international total denotes of total revenue denotes change from to united states revenue increased primarily due to a million increase in sales of packet optical transport products  a million increase in software and services revenue and a million increase in packet optical switching products 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in carrier ethernet solutions sales 
international revenue increased primarily due to a million increase in packet optical transport revenue  a million increase in software and services revenue and an million increase in sales of packet optical switching products 
a sizable portion of our revenue continues to come from sales to a small number of service providers  particularly within our packet optical switching and carrier ethernet solutions businesses where four customers accounted for greater than approximately of our revenue in fiscal as a result  our financial results are significantly affected by spending levels and the business opportunities and challenges encountered by our service provider customers 
moreover  our contracts do not have terms that obligate these customers to purchase any minimum or specific amounts of equipment or services 
our concentration of revenue has been adversely affected in prior periods by consolidation activity among our customers 
in addition  some of our customers are pursuing efforts to outsource the management and operation of their networks  or have indicated a procurement strategy to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase equipment  which could further affect our concentration of revenue where we participate in these efforts 
sales to at t were million  or of our revenue  in fiscal and million  or of our revenue  in fiscal we did not have any other customers accounting for greater than of revenue in fiscal or cost of goods sold and gross profit product cost of goods sold consists primarily of amounts paid to third party contract manufacturers  component costs  employee related costs and overhead  shipping and logistics costs associated with manufacturing related operations  warranty and other contractual obligations  royalties  license fees  amortization of intangible assets  cost of excess and obsolete inventory and  when applicable  estimated losses on committed customer contracts 
services cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct and third party costs  including employee related costs  associated with our provision of services including installation  deployment  maintenance support  consulting and training activities  and  when applicable  estimated losses on committed customer contracts 
our gross profit as a percentage of revenue  or gross margin  continues to be susceptible to quarterly fluctuation due to a number of factors 
gross margin can vary significantly depending upon the mix and concentration of revenue by segment or product line  the concentration of lower margin common equipment sales within a segment or product line  geographic mix and the mix of customers and services in a given fiscal quarter 
gross margin can also be affected by our introduction of new products  charges for excess and obsolete inventory  changes in warranty costs and sales volume 
we expect that gross margins will be subject to fluctuation based on our level of success in driving cost reductions  rationalizing our supply chain and consolidating third party contract manufacturers and distribution sites as part of our effort to optimize our operations 
gross margin can also be adversely affected by the competitive environment and level of pricing pressure we encounter 
the combination of the recent period of uncertain market conditions  constraints on customer capital expenditures and increased competition has resulted in a heightened customer focus on pricing and return on network investment  as customers address network traffic growth and strive to increase revenue and profit 
while competition is intense across our segments  our exposure to pricing pressure has been most severe in metro and core applications for our packet optical transport platforms  particularly in international markets 
as a result  in an effort to retain or secure customers  enter new markets or capture market share  in the past we have and in the future we may agree to pricing or other unfavorable commercial terms that result in lower or negative gross margins on a particular order or group of orders 
because packet optical transport and international revenue 
table of contents comprise a greater percentage of our overall revenue than in prior periods  these market dynamics may adversely affect our gross margins and results of operations in certain periods 
service gross margin can be affected by the mix of customers and services  particularly the mix between deployment and maintenance services  geographic mix and the timing and extent of any investments in internal resources to support this business

liquidity and capital resources at october   our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents and long term investments in marketable debt securities  representing us treasuries 
the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and long term investments in thousands 
table of contents october  increase decrease cash and cash equivalents long term investments in marketable debt securities total cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities during fiscal  we received million related to the early termination of the carling lease  of which million reduced cash used by operations and million reduced cash used by investing activities 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of part ii for additional information relating to the valuation of this contingent refund right at the closing of the men acquisition and the early termination of the carling lease 
the decrease in total cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities during fiscal  notwithstanding the effect of the receipt of the early termination payment above  was primarily related to the following million cash used from operations  consisting of million for changes in working capital and million from net losses adjusted for non cash charges 
use of cash reflects cash payments of million of acquisition and integration related expense and restructuring costs  of which million was reflected in net losses adjusted for non cash charges and million was reflected in changes in working capital  and million for purchases of equipment  furniture  fixtures and intellectual property 
these decreases were partially offset by million from stock issuances upon sales under our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options  million transferred from restricted cash related to reduced collateral requirements for our standby letters of credit described below  and million in proceeds from the sale of a privately held technology company in which we had a minority equity investment 
as expected  our investment in working capital for fiscal reflects the increased scale of our operations resulting from the men acquisition 
we regularly evaluate our liquidity position  debt obligations  and anticipated cash needs to fund our operating plans and may consider capital raising and other market opportunities that may be available to us 
based on past performance and current expectations  we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and investments will satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures  and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations through at least the next months 
the following sections set forth the components of our million of cash used by operating activities for fiscal net loss adjusted for non cash charges the following tables set forth in thousands our net loss adjusted for non cash charges during the period

our days sales outstanding dsos decreased from days for fiscal to days for fiscal our dsos level for fiscal largely reflects the timing of the men acquisition and the effect on this calculation of having only a partial year of revenue from the men business 
utilizing annualized fourth quarter revenue for purposes of this calculation would have resulted in dsos of days for fiscal and days for fiscal our dsos increased due to growth in international sales  which generally involve longer payment cycles

deferred revenue deferred revenue increased by million during fiscal product deferred revenue represents payments received in advance of shipment and payments received in advance of our ability to recognize revenue 
services deferred revenue is related to payment for service contracts that will be recognized over the contract term 
the following table reflects in thousands the balance of deferred revenue and the change in this balance from the end of fiscal through the end of fiscal 
table of contents october  increase decrease products services total deferred revenue contractual obligations during fiscal  we received notice from nortel of the exercise of its early termination rights under the carling lease  shortening our lease term from ten years to five years 
this had the effect of materially reducing our longer term operating lease commitments in the table below as compared to fiscal we expect such longer term operating lease commitments to increase at such time that a lease for alternative space is identified 
the following is a summary of our future minimum payments under contractual obligations as of october  in thousands total less than one year one to three years three to five years thereafter interest due on convertible notes principal due at maturity on convertible notes operating leases purchase obligations total the amount for operating leases above does not include insurance  taxes  maintenance and other costs required by the applicable operating lease 
these costs are variable and are not expected to have a material impact 
purchase obligations relate to purchase order commitments to our contract manufacturers and component suppliers for inventory 
in certain instances  we are permitted to cancel  reschedule or adjust these orders 
consequently  only a portion of the amount reported above relates to firm  non cancelable and unconditional obligations 
as of october   we also had approximately million of other long term obligations in our consolidated balance sheet for unrecognized tax positions that are not included in this table because the timing or amount of any cash settlement with the respective tax authority cannot be reasonably estimated 
this table does not reflect the costs associated with our new headquarters lease entered into subsequent to october  see item of part i of this annual report for more information 
some of our commercial commitments  including some of the future minimum payments in operating leases set forth above and certain commitments to customers  are secured by standby letters of credit collateralized by restricted cash 
restricted cash balances are included in other current assets or other long term assets depending upon the duration of the underlying letter of credit obligation 
the following is a summary of our commercial commitments secured by standby letters of credit by commitment expiration date as of october  in thousands total less than one year one to three years three to five years standby letters of credit off balance sheet arrangements we do not engage in any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
in particular  we do not have any equity interests in so called limited purpose entities  which include special purpose entities spes and structured finance entities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expense  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
on an ongoing basis  we reevaluate our 
table of contents estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  derivatives and hedging  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
among other things  these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
to the extent that there are material differences between our estimates and actual results  our consolidated financial statements will be affected 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect those areas where significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
customer purchase agreements and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and evidence of customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery or services rendered 
we assess whether the price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer payment history 
revenue for maintenance services is generally deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed 
we apply the percentage of completion method to long term arrangements where we are required to undertake significant production  customizations or modification engineering  and reasonable and reliable estimates of revenue and cost are available 
utilizing the percentage of completion method  we recognize revenue based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to date to total estimated costs expected to be incurred 
in instances that do not meet the percentage of completion method criteria  recognition of revenue is deferred until there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
software revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
in instances where final acceptance criteria of the software is specified by the customer  revenue is deferred until there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
we limit the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services  future performance obligations or subject to customer specified return or refund privileges 
accounting for multiple element arrangements entered into prior to fiscal arrangements with customers may include multiple deliverables  including any combination of equipment  services and software 
if multiple element arrangements include software or software related elements that are essential to the equipment  we allocate the arrangement fee among separate units of accounting 
multiple element arrangements that include software are separated into more than one unit of accounting if the functionality of the delivered element s is not dependent on the undelivered element s  there is vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered element s  and general revenue recognition criteria related to the delivered element s have been met 
the amount of product and services revenue recognized is affected by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and  if so  whether vsoe of fair value exists 
vsoe is established based on our standard pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately 
in determining vsoe  we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and our ability to establish vsoe for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
for all other multiple element arrangements  we separate the elements into more than one unit of accounting if the delivered element s have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered element s  and delivery of the undelivered element s is probable and substantially in our control 
revenue is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative fair value of each accounting unit or using the residual method if objective evidence of fair value does not exist for the delivered element s 
the revenue recognition criteria described above are applied to each separate unit of accounting 
if these criteria are not met  revenue is deferred until the criteria are met or the last element has been delivered 
accounting for multiple element arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal in october  the financial accounting standards board  fasb amended the accounting standard for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables which provided guidance on how the arrangement fee should be allocated 
the amended 
table of contents guidance allows the use of management best estimate of selling price besp for individual elements of an arrangement when vsoe or third party evidence tpe is unavailable 
additionally  it eliminates the residual method of revenue recognition in accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements 
the fasb also amended the accounting guidance for revenue arrangements with software elements to exclude from the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance  tangible products that contain both software and non software components that function together to deliver the product essential functionality 
we adopted the new accounting guidance on a prospective basis for arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after november  under the new guidance  we separate elements into more than one unit of accounting if the delivered element s have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  and delivery of the undelivered element s is probable and substantially in our control 
therefore  the new guidance allows for deliverables  for which revenue was previously deferred due to an absence of fair value  to be separated and recognized as revenue as delivered 
also  because the residual method has been eliminated  discounts offered by us are allocated to all deliverables  rather than to the delivered element s 
our adoption of the new guidance for revenue arrangements changed the accounting for certain products that consist of hardware and software components  in which these components together provided the product essential functionality 
for transactions involving these products entered into prior to fiscal  we recognized revenue based on software revenue recognition guidance 
revenue for multiple element arrangements is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of each element  with revenue recognized when the revenue recognition criteria are met for each delivered element 
we determine the selling price for each deliverable based upon the selling price hierarchy for multiple deliverable arrangements 
under this hierarchy  we use vsoe of selling price  if it exists  or tpe of selling price if vsoe does not exist 
if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a deliverable  we use our besp for that deliverable 
vsoe is established based on our standard pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately 
in determining vsoe  which exists across certain of our service offerings  we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range 
we have generally been unable to establish tpe of selling price because our go to market strategy differs from that of others in our markets  and the extent of customization and differentiated features and functions varies among comparable products or services from our peers 
we determine besp based upon management approved pricing guidelines  which consider multiple factors including the type of product or service  gross margin objectives  competitive and market conditions  and the go to market strategy  all of which can affect pricing practices 
historically  for arrangements with multiple elements  we were typically able to establish fair value for undelivered elements and so we applied the residual method 
as a result  assuming the adoption of the accounting guidance above on a prospective basis for arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after november   the effect on revenue recognized for fiscal would have been an increase of approximately million 
we expect that this new accounting guidance will facilitate our efforts to optimize our offerings due to the better alignment between the economics of an arrangement and the accounting 
this may lead to engaging in new go to market practices in the future 
in particular  we expect that the new accounting standards will enable us to better integrate products and services without vsoe into existing offerings and solutions 
as these go to market strategies evolve  we may modify our pricing practices in the future  which could result in changes in selling prices  including both vsoe and besp 
as a result  our future revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements could differ materially from the results in the current period 
we are currently unable to determine the impact that the newly adopted accounting guidance could have on our revenue as these go to market strategies evolve 
our total deferred revenue for products was million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
our services revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed 
our total deferred revenue for services was million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
business combinations we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
all of the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies and contingent consideration are recognized at their fair value as of the acquisition date 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and net intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate 
table of contents purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill 
these assumptions and estimates include a market participant use of the asset and the appropriate discount rates for a market participant 
our estimates are based on historical experience  information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and  when appropriate  includes assistance from independent third party appraisal firms 
our significant assumptions and estimates can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future  the appropriate weighted average cost of capital  and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 
during fiscal  we completed the men acquisition for a purchase price of million 
as a result of the purchase price allocation to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as contingent consideration  there was no value assigned to goodwill 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report 
share based compensation we estimate the fair value of our restricted stock unit awards based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
our outstanding restricted stock unit awards are subject to service based vesting conditions and or performance based vesting conditions 
we recognize the estimated fair value of service based awards  net of estimated forfeitures  as share based expense ratably over the vesting period on a straight line basis 
awards with performance based vesting conditions require the achievement of certain financial or other performance criteria or targets as a condition to the vesting  or acceleration of vesting 
we recognize the estimated fair value of performance based awards  net of estimated forfeitures  as share based expense over the performance period  using graded vesting  which considers each performance period or tranche separately  based upon our determination of whether it is probable that the performance targets will be achieved 
at each reporting period  we reassess the probability of achieving the performance targets and the performance period required to meet those targets 
determining whether the performance targets will be achieved involves judgment  and the estimate of expense may be revised periodically based on changes in the probability of achieving the performance targets 
revisions are reflected in the period in which the estimate is changed 
if any performance goals are not met  no compensation cost is ultimately recognized against that goal  and  to the extent previously recognized  compensation cost is reversed 
because share based compensation expense is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest  the amount of expense takes into account estimated forfeitures 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
changes in these estimates and assumptions can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our share based compensation 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for information regarding our assumptions related to share based compensation and the amount of share based compensation expense we incurred for the periods covered in this report 
as of october   total unrecognized compensation expense was million i million  which relates to unvested stock options and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of year  and ii million  which relates to unvested restricted stock units and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
we recognize windfall tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options or release of restricted stock units directly to stockholders equity only when realized 
a windfall tax benefit occurs when the actual tax benefit realized by us upon an employee disposition of a share based award exceeds the deferred tax asset  if any  associated with the award that we had recorded 
when assessing whether a tax benefit relating to share based compensation has been realized  we follow the tax law with and without method 
under the with and without method  the windfall is considered realized and recognized for financial statement purposes only when an incremental benefit is provided after considering all other tax benefits including our net operating losses 
the with and without method results in the windfall from share based compensation awards always being effectively the last tax benefit to be considered 
consequently  the windfall attributable to share based compensation will not be considered realized in instances where our net operating loss carryover that is unrelated to windfalls is sufficient to offset the current year taxable income before considering the effects of current year windfalls 
reserve for inventory obsolescence we make estimates about future customer demand for our products when establishing the appropriate reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
we write down inventory that has become obsolete or unmarketable by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
inventory write downs are a component of our product cost of goods sold 
upon recognition of the write down  a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
we recorded charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
these charges were primarily related to excess inventory due to a change in forecasted sales across our product line 
in an effort to limit our exposure to delivery delays and to satisfy customer 
table of contents needs we purchase inventory based on forecasted sales across our product lines 
in addition  part of our research and development strategy is to promote the convergence of similar features and functionalities across our product lines 
each of these practices exposes us to the risk that our customers will not order products for which we have forecasted sales  or will purchase less than we have forecasted 
historically  we have experienced write downs due to changes in strategic direction  discontinuance of a product and declines in market conditions 
if actual market conditions worsen or differ from those we have assumed  if there is a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there is a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence due to a rapid change in technology  we may be required to take additional inventory write downs  and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
our inventory net of allowance for excess and obsolescence was million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is based on management assessment  on a specific identification basis  of the collectibility of customer accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally have not required collateral or other forms of security from customers 
in determining the appropriate balance for our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  management considers each individual customer account receivable in order to determine collectibility 
in doing so  we consider creditworthiness  payment history  account activity and communication with such customer 
if a customer financial condition changes  or if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  we may be required to take a charge for an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
our accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  was million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
long lived assets our long lived assets include equipment  furniture and fixtures  finite lived intangible assets  and maintenance spares 
as of october  and october  these assets totaled million and million  net  respectively 
we test long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets carrying amount is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows 
our long lived assets are assigned to asset groups which represents the lowest level for which we identify cash flows 
deferred tax valuation allowance as of october   we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting nearly all our net deferred tax assets of billion 
when measuring the need for a valuation allowance  we assess both positive and negative evidence regarding the realizability of these deferred tax assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in determining net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances  management is required to make judgments and estimates related to projections of profitability  the timing and extent of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  applicable tax rates  transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies 
the valuation allowance is reviewed quarterly and is maintained until sufficient positive evidence exists to support a reversal 
because evidence such as our operating results during the most recent three year period is afforded more weight than forecasted results for future periods  our cumulative loss during this three year period represents sufficient negative evidence regarding the need for nearly a full valuation allowance 
we will release this valuation allowance when management determines that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
any future release of valuation allowance may be recorded as a tax benefit increasing net income or as an adjustment to paid in capital  based on tax ordering requirements 
warranty our liability for product warranties  included in other accrued liabilities  was million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from one to five years 
we accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of goods sold based on associated material costs  technical support labor costs and associated overhead 
material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment 
technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period 
the provision for product warranties was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
as a result of the substantial completion of integration activities related to the men acquisition  we consolidated certain support operations and processes during the first quarter of fiscal  resulting in a reduction in costs to service future warranty obligations 
due to this consolidation and resulting efficiencies  we expect to realize lower failure rate costs and accordingly reversed a million non cash loss contingency included in our warranty liability 
the provision for warranty claims may fluctuate on a 
table of contents quarterly basis depending upon the mix of products and customers in that period 
if actual product failure rates  material replacement costs  service or labor costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty provision would be required 
an increase in warranty claims or the related costs associated with satisfying these warranty obligations could increase our cost of sales and negatively affect our gross margin 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for information relating to our discussion of the effects of recent accounting pronouncements 
unaudited quarterly results of operations the tables below in thousands  except per share data set forth the operating results in our consolidated statements of operations for each of the eight quarters in the period ended october  and reflect the impact of our march  acquisition of the men business 
this information is unaudited  but in our opinion reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair statement of such information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
there were no material  retroactive measurement period adjustments related to the men acquisition 
the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate sensitivity 
we currently hold an investment in a us government obligation that matures in january see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for information relating to investments and fair value 
this investment is sensitive to interest rate movements and its fair value will decline as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates decline 
the estimated impact on this investment of a basis point increase in interest rates across the yield curve from rates in effect as of the balance sheet date would be a million decline in value 
foreign currency exchange risk 
as a global concern  our business and results of operations are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
historically  our sales have primarily been denominated in us dollars and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue had not been material 
as a result of our increased global presence  in large part resulting from the men acquisition  a larger percentage of our revenue is non us dollar denominated with canadian dollars and euros being our most significant foreign currency revenue streams 
if the us dollar strengthens against these currencies  our revenues reported in us dollars would decline 
for our us dollar denominated sales  an increase in the value of the us dollar would increase the real cost to our customers of our products in markets outside the united states which could impact our competitive position 
with regard to operating expense  our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to operating expense incurred in canadian dollars  british pounds  euros and indian rupees 
during fiscal  approximately of our operating expense was non us dollar denominated 
if these currencies strengthen  costs reported in us dollars will increase  which would increase our expenses 
during fiscal  research and development expense was adversely affected by approximately million  net of hedging  due to the weakening of the us dollar in relation to the canadian dollar in comparison to fiscal from time to time  we use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce part of the variability in certain forecasted non us dollar denominated cash flows 
generally  these derivatives are for maturities of months or less and are designated as cash flow hedges 
we consider several factors when evaluating hedges of our forecasted foreign currency exposures  such as significance of the exposure  offsetting economic exposures  potential costs of hedging  and the potential for hedge ineffectiveness 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for purposes other than hedging economic exposures 
during fiscal  we entered into forward contracts to reduce the variability in our canadian dollar and indian rupee denominated operating expenses which principally relate to our research and development activities 
convertible debt outstanding 
the fair market value of each of our outstanding issues of convertible notes is subject to interest rate and market price risk due to the convertible feature of the notes and other factors 
generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the fair market value of the notes may also increase as the market price of our stock rises and decrease as the market price of the stock falls 
interest rate and market value changes affect the fair market value of the notes  and may affect the prices at which we would be able to repurchase such notes were we to do so 
these changes do not impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
for additional information on the fair value of our outstanding notes  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report
