item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capitalized terms used in this item and not otherwise defined have the meanings ascribed to such terms under the caption important defined terms used in this form k which immediately precedes part i of this form k 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this form k and the narrative description of our business contained in item of this form k 
overview state auto financial is a property and casualty insurance holding company 
our insurance subsidiaries are part of the state auto group and pooling arrangement described below 
the state auto group markets a broad line of property and casualty insurance products in all states and the district of columbia exclusively through independent insurance agencies  which include retail agents and wholesale brokers 
our pooled companies are rated a superior by the am best company 
state auto financial s principal subsidiaries are state auto p c  milbank  farmers and sa ohio  each of which is a property and casualty insurance company  and stateco  which provides investment management services to affiliated insurance companies 
prior to january   we operated our business in three reportable segments personal insurance  business insurance collectively the insurance segments or our insurance segments and investment operations 
the three segments reflected the manner in which we managed our business and reported our results internally to our principal operating decision makers 
the personal insurance segment provides primarily personal auto and homeowners to the personal insurance market 
the business insurance segment provides primarily commercial auto  commercial multi peril  fire allied lines  other product liability and workers compensation insurance to small to medium sized businesses within the commercial insurance market 
the investment operations segment  managed by stateco  provides investment services for our invested assets 
in  the state auto group began writing new commercial specialty business through red  which allowed us to offer insurance coverages in the program and alternative risk markets for business products such as general liability  commercial auto  workers compensation and property 
in  the financial results of business written through red were included in our business insurance segment results 
with the acquisition of the rockhill insurance group and the build out of red  in  management focused on assessing and positioning a realignment of our internal organization  including people  processes and compensation reward programs  to be more strategic in the personal  business and specialty insurance markets 
considering these internal changes  and with the inclusion of the rockhill insurers into the pooling arrangement as of january   our reportable insurance segments will change from personal and business insurance to personal insurance  business insurance and specialty insurance  aligning how these insurance segments report to our principal operating decision makers 
we evaluate the performance of our insurance segments using industry financial measurements determined based on sap  and certain measures determined under gaap 
we evaluate our investment operations segment based on investment returns of assets managed 
financial information about our segments for is set forth in this item and in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
executive summary in order to improve our operating and financial results  we focus on four performance drivers rational growth  underwriting profit  risk management  and capital management 

table of contents rational growth our growth in and outperformed the industry  which generally contracted  and based on preliminary data now available to us  we believe our premium growth again outperformed the industry in we consider rational growth to be premium growth that matches or exceeds the premium growth rates of designated peer property and casualty insurance companies  as well as the property and casualty insurance industry as a whole  while still considering underwriting profit  risk management  and capital management 
there are primarily two ways we grow our business 
the first way is referred to as organic growth 
this means we either sell more policies or increase the price of our product 
ideally  we will accomplish both simultaneously 
organic growth is challenging  especially in a stagnant economy and well capitalized industry 
if the price of our product is too high  customers may go elsewhere  and so the desired premium increases could be offset by a reduction in policy count 
if the price is too low  we could increase our policy count at the risk of surrendering profit 
we also seek growth in ways other than price 
when we are faced with untenably low prices from our competition  our goal is to remain an attractive market to our insureds  retail agents and wholesale brokers by stressing the strengths we bring to the marketplace  such as our product offerings and innovation  underwriting criteria  quality of service to insureds  retail agents and wholesale brokers  relationships with our retail agents and wholesale brokers  prompt and fair claims handling and settlement  financial stability  and technology  making us a preferred business partner 
organic growth in our business insurance segment  other than our red book of business  has been more difficult for us to achieve than growth in our personal insurance segment 
the primary reasons are the continued impact of the economy on premium bases and our commitment to underwriting 
the business lines segment has been extremely competitive 
generally  business lines premiums and coverages are higher per policy than personal lines 
until the market accepts adequately priced product  we will be challenged to grow our standard business insurance book 
however  we are seeking to balance our traditional underwriting discipline with new products and pricing tools that support the production of profitable new business 
our industry is characterized by its cyclical nature 
during the current phase in the cycle  we are willing to sacrifice premium growth in our business lines in favor of achieving underwriting profitability 
while organic growth in the standard business insurance market has been difficult  we are competing effectively in the personal lines market 
our retail agents are finding attractive sales opportunities for auto and homeowners business 
in addition  because we are heavily cross sold in personal lines and continue to experience strong retention  we are well positioned to benefit from this trend 
alternatively  we can grow by acquiring other companies and their distribution points  entering new states  offering new products  appointing new agents or offering our products through alternative distribution channels 
this can be generally labeled as growth through merger and acquisition 
since stfc went public in  the state auto group has successfully acquired six insurance groups comprising more than a dozen companies 
acquisition  as opposed to organic growth  has several advantages 
it can be a practical  efficient way to leverage the acquired company s existing channel relationships when introducing our products and services into a new state or new markets  rather than appointing one agent at a time  which can be expensive and difficult 
often acquisitions bring with it needed talent and competencies to the larger state auto group 
an acquisition though  is also a major investment of capital 
immediate consequences of a poor acquisition choice can include overstaffing  incompatible automation systems and an ineffective distribution force 
we believe it is important to have processes and talent in place to grow both organically and through mergers and acquisitions 
in  our parent  state auto mutual  took a major growth step by acquiring the rockhill insurance group  a specialty property and casualty insurance group  serving both the standard and excess and surplus lines insurance markets  whose product lines include commercial auto  property  bonds surety and fidelity and general liability 
red acts as a managing general underwriter for a variety of property and casualty coverages in the program and alternative risk markets 
the insurers owned by rtw provide 
table of contents workers compensation coverage 
while our top line growth in business insurance benefited from red in  we will see additional benefit from the other specialty businesses of rockhill and rtw  when the financial results of these units are incorporated into our pooled results beginning january  we believe the growth and profit potential are excellent and provide diversification to our current product lines 
underwriting profit we have long been known as an insurance company that produces an underwriting profit 
our combined ratio  however  has exceeded for the last three years 
it is critical to us that we return homeowners to underwriting profitability 
homeowners insurance is our second largest product concentration  after standard auto 
a multi year effort to implement solutions has produced an aggressive insurance to value program that audits policy coverage against the actual value of the property 
we have also implemented separate  mandatory wind and hail deductibles for properties in select states and by peril rating for homeowners in key states 
by peril rating calculates a separate premium for each peril and allows us to price more effectively for weather differences  which is the leading cause of homeowners losses 
our claim handling has become more specialized  with the addition of dedicated large and small property claim handlers and the formation of a catastrophe claim team  lessening our dependency on independent adjusters 
we are also continuing our efforts to diversify geographically  with particular emphasis on those areas less prone to catastrophic property losses 
underwriting results in homeowners have improved in pricing the property and casualty insurance product has become a sophisticated science  and to that end we have made significant investment in our actuarial and financial teams  adding depth and talent to these important functions 
we are dedicated to cost based pricing  with each line of business priced to generate a profit 
we implement periodic rate changes throughout our states 
underwriting profitably requires more than sensible pricing  coverage enhancements and discerning risk evaluation 
by reducing the per policy costs of operating our business  we increase the profit margin 
in early  we began a restructuring of our field and claims operations 
we are seeing productivity and expense ratio improvements 
the restructuring meant a reduction in both the personal and commercial lines staffs and an increase in our information technology and claims personnel 
while difficult for us  these reductions were necessary  and we believe we handled the reductions with sensitivity  including providing severance packages and retirement incentives to those associates affected 
changes currently underway in our claim organization are expected to positively impact indemnity payout  improve service and reduce costs 
we have already reduced salvage yard vendor fees through negotiation with vendors 
a new auto physical damage unit has significantly reduced independent adjuster expenses and improved indemnity benefits on auto physical damage claims 
the expansion of our house counsel operation not only contributes to a lower loss ratio  but also improves service 
risk management the objective of our enterprise risk management program is to help identify  understand  communicate and assure satisfactory mitigation or exploitation of risks associated with our business 
numerous risks are addressed  including a variety of underwriting  operational  market  credit and strategic risks 
all of our business units play important roles in risk identification and in developing and executing risk mitigation strategies 
an internal  multi disciplined team was formed in to address our geographic spread of risk and catastrophe loss exposure 
weather related catastrophes  including localized wind and hail storms  have been an onerous variable in our profitability formula in recent years  contributing to volatility in our financial results 
we remain committed to taking steps to more effectively manage our catastrophe exposures and improve our geographic diversification 
the combination of walking away from business in high risk or highly concentrated areas  while growing more aggressively in areas with lower property exposures or in less catastrophe prone areas  
table of contents or in areas where the catastrophe risk is uncorrelated to our existing footprints  are effective approaches to spread risk 
our merger and acquisition strategy also contributes to spread of risk 
for example  the red  rockhill and rtw operations provide an additional measure of product and geographical diversification 
catastrophe exposure management focuses on the perils of hurricane  earthquake  severe thunderstorms  tornadoes and hail 
computer modeling is used to project estimates of potential losses from these events 
such modeling is an important element of designing our property reinsurance programs 
the results of hurricane modeling affect our risk appetites across six relevant geographic zones texas  the gulf states  florida  the southeast  the mid atlantic  and the northeast 
modeling for severe thunderstorms  tornadoes and hail has helped us identify areas of midwest property concentrations for reduction or constraint  as well as areas with lower and or uncorrelated exposure to target for growth 
risk management is also relevant to our business operations 
in  state auto mutual completed the construction of a new data center located more than miles from our corporate headquarters  and we are in the process of migrating many of our it functions to it 
its state of the art design allows it to function securely under work load and environmental pressures 
the commitment to make our data centers and processing systems secure and dependable is ongoing and  given the critical nature of information technology  will continue to remain a risk management priority 
capital management in capital management  our number one goal remains preserving capital and enhancing liquidity in order to maintain a financial strength rating from am best that will enable us to maintain our preferred partnership status with our insureds  retail agents and wholesale brokers 
stfc has paid a dividend every quarter since its inception in  and has never lowered that dividend 
we have maintained a debt to capital ratio that reinforces our strong capital structure 
members of the state auto group pay a portion of the premiums received to reinsurers in exchange for reinsuring a portion of their exposures 
this is done primarily to reduce net liability on individual risks or for individual loss occurrences  including catastrophic losses 
we maintain reserves for the eventual payment of losses and loss expenses for both reported claims and ibnr  based on management s best estimate at a given point in time 
although management uses many resources to calculate reserves  there is no precise method for determining the ultimate liability 
our objective is to set reserves that reasonably approximate the ultimate liability for insured losses and loss expenses 
we regularly review and adjust loss reserves as appropriate 
our disciplined investment strategy emphasizes the quality of our investment grade fixed maturity portfolio and an internally managed  diversified equity portfolio 
we have diversified our equity portfolio  utilizing outside managers to invest in us small cap equities and international equity funds 
this was designed to achieve greater total return over time with reduced volatility 
we suffered investment losses in the broad based and dramatic market decline in  but we have since more than recovered those losses in the healthier markets of and in our opinion  a diversified portfolio heavily weighted in investment grade bonds  coupled with a diversified equity portfolio  is the right strategy for most market cycles 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet  revenues and expenses for the period then ended and the financial entries in the accompanying notes to the financial statements 
such estimates and assumptions could change in the future  as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed in this item we have identified the policies and estimates described below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of the results of our operations 

table of contents investments our fixed maturity  equity security and certain other invested asset investments are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value 
the unrealized holding gains or losses  net of applicable deferred taxes  are shown as a separate component of stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  and as such are not included in the determination of net income 
investment income is recognized when earned  and capital gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold 
we regularly monitor our investment portfolio for declines in value that are other than temporarily impaired otti  an assessment that requires significant management judgment regarding the evidence known 
such judgments could change in the future as more information becomes known which could negatively impact the amounts reported herein 
we consider the following factors when assessing our equity securities and other invested assets for otti the length of time and or the significance of decline below cost  our ability and intent to hold these securities through their recovery periods  the current financial condition of the issuer and its future business prospects  and the ability of the market value to recover to cost in the near term 
we recognize otti charges on our externally managed small cap equity portfolio and a segment of our large cap portfolio  as we are unable to make the assertion regarding our intent to hold these securities that are currently valued below cost until recovery in the near term 
when an equity security or other invested asset has been determined to have a decline in fair value that is other than temporary  we adjust the cost basis of the security to fair value 
this results in a charge to earnings as a realized loss  which is not reversed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 
future increases or decreases in fair value  if not other than temporary  are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we also consider the following factors when assessing our fixed maturity investments for otti the financial condition of the issuer including receipt of scheduled principal and interest cash flows  our intent to sell  and if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investments before recovery 
when a fixed maturity has been determined to have an other than temporary impairment  the impairment charge is separated into an amount representing the credit loss  which is recognized in earnings as a realized loss  and the amount related to non credit factors  which is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
future increases or decreases in fair value  if not other than temporary  are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
deferred acquisition costs acquisition costs  consisting of commissions  premium taxes and certain underwriting expenses relating to the production of property and casualty business  are deferred and amortized over the same period in which the related premiums are earned 
the method followed for computing the acquisition costs limits the amount of such deferred costs to their estimated realizable value 
in determining estimated realizable value  the computation gives effect to the premiums to be earned  losses and loss expenses expected to be incurred  and certain other costs expected to be incurred as premium is earned 
future changes in estimates  the most significant of which is expected losses and loss adjustment expenses  that indicate a reduction in expected future profitability may result in unrecoverable deferred acquisition costs 
we have not recorded any significant changes in estimates for the years ended december   and  respectively 
losses and loss expenses payable our loss reserves reflect all unpaid amounts for claims that have been reported  as well as for ibnr claims 
our loss reserves are not discounted to present value 
loss reserves are management s best estimates mbe at a given point in time of what we expect to pay to settle all claims incurred as of that date based on known facts  circumstances and historical trends 
loss reserves at the individual claim level are established on either a case reserve basis or formula reserve basis 
table of contents depending on the type and circumstances of the loss 
the case reserve amounts are determined by claims adjusters based on our reserving practices  which take into account the type of risk  the circumstances surrounding each claim and applicable policy provisions 
the formula reserves are based on historical data for similar claims with provision for changes caused by inflation 
case reserves and formula reserves are reviewed on a regular basis  and as new data becomes available  estimates are updated resulting in adjustments to loss reserves 
generally  reported losses initially reserved on a formula basis and not settled after six months are case reserved at that time 
the process for calculating the ibnr component of the loss reserve is to develop an estimate of the ultimate losses and allocated loss expenses incurred  and subtract all amounts already paid or held as case or formula reserves 
the determination of ultimate losses integrates information and analysis provided by several disciplines within our company  including claims  actuarial and accounting 
this assessment requires considerable judgment in understanding how claims mature  which lines of business are the most volatile  and how trends change over time 
loss reserves represent an estimate at a given point in time based on many variables including historical and statistical information  inflation  legal developments  storm loss estimates and economic conditions 
although we consider many different sources of information  as well as a number of actuarial methodologies to estimate our loss reserves  there is no single method for determining the exact ultimate liability 
our internal actuarial staff conducts quarterly reviews of projected loss development information to assist management in making estimates of ultimate losses and loss expenses 
several factors are considered in estimating ultimate liabilities including consistency in relative case reserve adequacy  consistency in claims settlement practices  recent legal developments  historical data  actuarial projections  accounting projections  exposure growth  current business conditions  catastrophe developments and late reported claims 
in addition  reasonableness tests are performed on many of the assumptions underlying each reserving methodology  such as claim frequency  claim severity and loss ratios 
nonetheless  changes which are not contemplated do occur over time  and those changes are incorporated in subsequent valuations of our loss reserves 
we use a number of different methodologies to estimate the ibnr component of our loss reserves 
our loss reserves include amounts related to short tail and long tail lines of business 
tail refers to the time period between the occurrence of a loss and the settlement of the claim 
in general  the longer the time span between the incidence of a loss and the settlement of the claim  the more the ultimate settlement amount can vary 
the reserving methods and strengths and weaknesses of each are described below 
short tail business for short tail business  claims are typically settled within five years  and the most common actuarial estimates are based on techniques using link ratio projections of incurred losses  paid losses  claim counts and claim severities 
each of these methods is described below in detail 
separate projections are made for catastrophes that are in the very early stages of development based on specific information known through the reporting date 
incurred loss development method the incurred loss development method is probably the most common actuarial method used in projecting indicated ibnr reserves 
this method uses paid loss experience as well as the outstanding estimates formula and case reserves for claims that have been reported and are still open 
the underlying assumption of the incurred loss development method is that case reserve adequacy remains consistent over time 
this method s advantage is its responsiveness to changes in reported losses  which is particularly valuable in the less mature accident years 
the disadvantage of the incurred loss development method is that case reserve adequacy changes will distort the ibnr projections 
paid loss development method the paid loss development method uses calculations that are very similar to the incurred loss development method 
the key difference is that the data used in the paid method exclude case reserve estimates  so only paid losses are utilized 
with this method  a payment pattern is estimated to project ultimate settlement values for each accident year  with the underlying assumption that claims are settled at a consistent rate over time 
neither case reserves nor the rate at which claims are reported except to the 
table of contents extent that the reporting pattern influences the payment pattern is relevant to the results of this method 
this method s advantage is the estimates of ultimate loss are independent of case reserve adequacy and are unaffected by company changes in case reserving philosophy 
the disadvantages are that the paid method does not use all of the available information  and in some cases the liability payment patterns require the application of very large development factors to relatively small payments in less mature accident years 
claim counts and severities method the counts and severities method calculations are very similar to the other methods 
the incurred claim counts reported to date are projected to an ultimate number 
similarly  the incurred loss severities are projected to an ultimate value 
the ultimate incurred count is multiplied by the ultimate incurred severity  for each accident year  to arrive at the ultimate incurred loss 
finally  as with the other loss development methods  an estimate of the ibnr reserve is calculated by subtracting the reported losses from the estimated ultimate losses 
long tail business reserve estimates for long tail business use the same methods listed above along with several other methods as determined by the actuary 
for example  premium based methods may be used in developing ultimate loss estimates  including the expected loss ratio  bornhuetter ferguson  and least squares techniques as described below 
we may also use statistical models when the historical patterns can be reasonably approximated 
expected loss ratio method the expected loss ratio method generates indicated ibnr by multiplying an expected loss ratio by earned premiums  then subtracting incurred to date losses 
for slower reporting lines of business  new products  or data that is very immature  the actual claim data is often too limited or too volatile for other projection methods 
with this method the premiums are used as a measure of loss exposure  and the loss ratios can be derived from pricing expectations 
bornhuetter ferguson method the bornhuetter ferguson method is a weighted average of the expected loss ratio method and the incurred loss development method  using the percentage of losses reported as the weight 
this method is particularly useful where there is a low volume of data in the current accident period  or where the experience is volatile 
in general  this method produces estimates that are similar to the incurred loss development method 
least square loss development method in the least squares loss development method the statistical technique of least squares regression is applied to a triangle of reported loss ratios to project the ultimate loss ratio in each accident year 
using historical loss ratios puts the data for each time period on a more consistent exposure basis  because premium levels are generally correlated with insured exposures 
a by product of the regression function is an estimate of credibility for each stage of development 
in cases where the regression parameters fall outside of a reasonable range  the projection defaults to the incurred loss method 
selection process in determining which reserving method to use for a particular line of business or accident year  diagnostic tests of loss ratios and severity trends are considered  as well as the historic case reserve adequacy and claim settlement rate 
in general  the incurred loss development method is used if the projections are stable  the data is credible  historic case reserve adequacy is consistent  and the loss ratios and loss severities are reasonable 
other reserving methods are considered as well for particular lines of business or accident years  along with supplemental information such as open claim counts and prior period development 
for example  if more than one method provides a reasonable projection  the actuary may select an average of those methods 
there is considerable judgment applied in the analysis of the historical patterns and in applying business knowledge of our underwriting and claims functions 
reserve ranges provide a quantification of the variability in the loss reserve projections 
the primary determinant in estimating the loss reserve range boundaries are the variances measured within the historical reserving data for the various lines of business 
mbe of loss reserves considers the expected variation to establish an appropriate position within a range 
mbe loss and alae reserves for the stfc pooled companies 
table of contents share of the pooled companies reserves at december   was million  within an estimated range of million to million 
these values presented are on a direct basis  gross of salvage and subrogation recoverable  and before reinsurance  except for the stfc pooled companies participation in the inter company pooling arrangement 
therefore  these values cannot be compared to other loss and loss expenses payable tables included elsewhere within this form k 
the potential impact of the loss reserve variability on net income can be illustrated using the range end points and carried reserve amounts listed above 
for example  if ultimate losses reach a level corresponding to the high point of the range  million  the reserve increase of million corresponds to an after tax decrease of million in net income  assuming a tax rate of 
likewise  should ultimate losses decline to a level corresponding to the low point of the range  million  the million reserve decrease would add million of after tax net income 
the loss reserve range noted above represents a range of reasonably likely reserves  not a range of all possible reserves 
therefore  the ultimate losses could reach levels corresponding to reserve amounts outside the range provided 
an important assumption underlying the loss reserve estimation methods for the major casualty lines is that the loss cost trends implicitly built into the loss and alae patterns will continue into the future 
to estimate the sensitivity of reserves to an unexpected change in inflation  projected calendar year payment patterns were applied to the december   other product liability loss and alae reserve to generate estimated annual incremental loss and alae payments for each subsequent calendar year 
then  for purposes of sensitivity testing  an additional annual loss cost trend of was added to the trend implicitly embedded in the estimated payment pattern  and revised incremental loss and alae payments were calculated 
this type of inflationary increase could arise from a variety of sources including tort law changes  development of new medical procedures  social inflation  and other inflationary changes in costs beyond assumed levels 
the estimated cumulative impact that this additional  unexpected increase in the loss cost trend would have on our results of operations over the lifetime of the underlying claims in other product liability is an increase of million on reserves  or a million reduction to net income  assuming a tax rate of 
inflation changes have much more impact on the longer tail commercial lines like other product liability and workers compensation  and much less impact on the shorter tail personal lines reserves 
in addition to establishing loss reserves  as described above  we establish reserves for ulae 
historical patterns of paid ulae relative to paid loss are analyzed along with historical claim counts including claims opened  claims closed  and claims remaining open 
the product of this analysis is an estimate of the relationship  or ratio  between ulae and loss underlying the current loss reserves 
this ratio is applied to the current outstanding loss reserves to estimate the required ulae reserve 
consequently  this component of the loss expense reserve has a proportional relationship to the overall claim inventory and held loss reserves 
the method assumes that the underlying claims process and mix of business do not change materially over time 

table of contents the following table sets forth a reconciliation of mbe of our direct loss and alae reserve to our net loss and loss expenses payable at december  and the stfc pooled companies net additional share of transactions assumed from state auto mutual through the pooling arrangement for the years ended december  and  respectively  has been reflected in the table below as assumed by stfc pooled companies

table of contents the property and casualty industry has experienced significant loss from claims related to asbestos  environmental remediation  product liability  mold and other mass torts 
asbestos reserves are million  and environmental reserves are million  for a total of million  or of net losses and loss expenses payable 
asbestos reserves decreased million and environmental reserves increased million from because we have insured primarily product retailers and distributors  we do not expect to incur the same level of liability  particularly related to asbestos  as companies that have insured manufacturing risks 
pension and postretirement benefit obligations pension and postretirement benefit obligations are long term in nature and require management s judgment in estimating the factors used to determine these amounts 
we review these factors annually  including the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
because these obligations are based on estimates which could change  the ultimate benefit obligation could be different from the amount estimated 
the state auto group has a defined benefit pension plan and a postretirement health care plan covering substantially all employees hired prior to january  collectively the benefit plans 
several factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the benefit plans 
key factors include assumptions about the expected rates of return on plan assets  discount rates  and health care cost trend rates 
we consider market conditions  including changes in investment returns and interest rates  in making these assumptions 
the actuarial assumptions used by us in determining benefit obligations may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower turnover and retirement rates  or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
to calculate the state auto group s december  benefit obligation for each of the benefit plans  we used a discount rate of based on an evaluation of the expected future benefit cash flows of our benefit plans used in conjunction with the citigroup pension discount curve at the measurement date 
a lower discount rate results in  all else being equal  a higher present value of the benefit obligation 
to calculate our benefit obligation at december  and net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december   a discount rate of and an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of were used 
we selected an expected long term rate of return on our plan assets by considering the mix of investments and stability of investment portfolio along with actual investment experience during the lifetime of the plans 
our assumptions regarding the discount rate and expected return on plan assets could have an effect on the amounts related to our benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost depending on the degree of change between reporting periods 
the following table sets forth an illustration of variability with respect to the discount rate on our december  benefit obligation and expected net periodic benefit cost for the year ending december   along with the variability of the expected return on plan assets to our expected net periodic benefit cost for the year ending december  holding all other assumptions constant  sensitivity to changes in any one of our key assumptions are as follows millions pension postretirement discount rate discount rate benefit obligation net periodic benefit cost expected return on plan assets expected return on plan assets net periodic benefit cost 
table of contents the accumulated benefit obligation abo of a defined benefit pension plan represents the actuarial present value of benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered prior to the measurement date and based on current and past compensation levels  while the projected benefit obligation pbo is the abo plus a factor for future compensation levels 
the abo  which considers current compensations level only  provides information about the obligation an employer would have if the plan were discontinued at the measurement date 
at december   the abo and pbo were million and million  respectively 
at december   the fair value of the assets of our defined benefit pension plan was million  which resulted in an underfunded status within our balance sheet of million 
on a cash flow basis  we target an annual contribution level that meets at least the targeted normal cost of the plan  as defined by erisa 
currently  we expect to make a cash contribution to the pension plan up to million in our unfunded status on our pension plan increased from million at december   to million at december  primarily influencing this increase are unrecognized gains and losses arising from factors including a decrease in the discount rate and expected to actual demographic changes  such as retirement age  mortality  turnover  and rate of compensation increases 
the cumulative unrecognized actuarial loss is systematically recognized as an increase in net periodic cost over the average future service period of active participants 
additional factors influencing this increase are as follows actual return on our plan assets was a gain of million compared to an expected return of million for a net decrease to our obligation and unrecognized actuarial loss of approximately million  and a million curtailment gain which reduced our obligation and unrecognized actuarial loss 
in november  we announced to our employees a one time election to select between two retirement benefit options to either continue participation in the existing defined benefit pension plan with no changes  or to choose a new defined contribution plan in which we automatically contribute a percentage of the employee s annual income resulting in a freeze to the employee s existing accrued defined pension benefit 
on may   employees elections were finalized which resulted in a million curtailment gain on this date 
our unfunded status on our postretirement medical plan retiree med plan increased from million at december  to million at december  influencing this increase are unrecognized net actuarial gain and loss adjustments arising from a decrease in the discount rate  as well as demographic changes and expected to actual claims experience  which at december  had the effect of increasing our obligation and unrecognized actuarial loss 
see note  pension and postretirement benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for further disclosures regarding our pension and postretirement benefit plans 
deferred income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the tax effect of the differences between the financial statement carrying value of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets are evaluated periodically by management to determine if they are realizable  requiring us to make certain judgments and assumptions 
in evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets  we consider all available evidence  including loss carryback potential  past operating results  existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years  projected performance of the business  future taxable income  including the ability to generate capital gains  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
if  based on available information  it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will not be realized  then a valuation allowance must be established with a corresponding charge to net income and or accumulated comprehensive income loss 
no valuation allowance was held by us at december

actual results could differ materially using different estimates and assumptions  or if conditions are significantly different in the future 
pooling arrangement the stfc pooled companies and the mutual pooled companies participate in a quota share reinsurance pooling arrangement referred to as the pooling arrangement

under applicable governance procedures  if the pooling arrangement were to be amended  management would make recommendations to the independent committees of the board of directors of both state auto mutual and stfc 
the independent committees review and evaluate such factors as they deem relevant and recommend any appropriate pooling change to the board of directors of both state auto mutual and stfc 
the pooling arrangement is terminable by any of our pooled companies at any time by any party by giving twelve months notice to the other parties and their respective

none of our pooled companies currently intends to terminate the pooling arrangement 
under the terms of the pooling arrangement  all subject premiums  incurred losses  loss expenses and other underwriting expenses are prorated among our pooled companies on the basis of their participation in the pool 
by spreading the underwriting risk the pooling arrangement is designed to produce more uniform and stable underwriting results for each of our pooled companies than any one company would experience individually 
this has the effect of providing each of our pooled companies with a similar mix of pooled property and casualty insurance business on a net basis

on december   we sold sa national to a third party for million plus a contingent earn out 
in deciding to sell sa national  we considered those businesses core to our long term strategy and concluded that the nonstandard auto market was no longer a strategic fit for us

insurance segments insurance industry regulators require our insurance subsidiaries to report their financial condition and results of operations using sap 
we use sap financial results  along with industry standard financial measures determined on a sap basis and certain measures determined on a gaap basis  to internally monitor the performance of our insurance segments and reward our employees 
one of the more significant differences between gaap and sap is that sap requires all underwriting expenses to be expensed immediately and not deferred over the same period that the premium is earned 
in converting sap underwriting results to gaap underwriting results  acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the periods the related written premiums are earned 
for a discussion of deferred acquisition costs  see critical accounting policies deferred acquisition costs section included in this item charges related to the restructuring of our field and claims operations  as well as those recorded due to the north carolina beach plan write off in  contributed to the difference between our gaap expense ratio and our sap expense ratio 
the restructuring differences relate mainly to the timing of the recognition of employee 
table of contents termination benefits 
sap requires us to estimate and immediately recognize the entire estimated costs related to severance  while gaap requires similar estimated costs to be recognized ratably over the remaining service period of the employees impacted 
the write off in related to the north carolina beach plan was included in the other expenses line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of income  and was therefore not included in the computation of the gaap expense ratio 
all references to financial measures or components thereof in this discussion are calculated on a gaap basis  unless otherwise noted

table of contents revenue we measure our top line growth for our insurance segments based on net written premiums  which provide us with an indication of how well we are doing in terms of revenue growth before it is actually earned 
our policies provide a fixed amount of coverage for a stated period of time  often referred to as the policy term

we believe introducing new products  leveraging predictive modeling capabilities and making it easier for our agents and policyholders to do business with us through enhanced systems and easier to use technologies will enable us to strategically grow our personal lines business in desired geographic locations 
customfit sm  our standard auto product  provides additional quoting opportunities by allowing our agents to tailor policies to fit the insured s needs 
further expanding our product portfolio  in the fourth quarter of we introduced our new homeowners customfit product which employs predictive modeling and by peril rating  allowing us to target business with expected long term profit potential 
compared to the traditional method of using fire as the main basis for rating  by peril rating uses multiple perils such as wind  hail and water in the rating process designed to provide a more accurate and adequate rate 
our customfit homeowners product has now been deployed in eight states and future deployment is planned for our remaining states 
our emphasis in personal insurance continues to be homeowners profitability 
in addition to rate increases and the introduction of our customfit homeowners product  we are aggressively evaluating and monitoring unprofitable agencies  which may include the review of an agency s existing policies  implementation of tighter new business and renewal guidelines for that agency  and the application of other loss mitigation tools for use by that agency  all with the purpose of improving operating results at the agency level 
we are continuing with a proactive insurance to value program  which is designed to have our insureds maintain an amount of coverage sufficient to replace their home and contents in the case of a total loss consistent with our loss settlement practices 
in addition  we have implemented wind and hail deductibles in states and are deploying strategies to provide greater spread of risk for our homeowners line 

table of contents over the years  we have focused on improved technology interfaces with our agents and policyholders 
this has included enhancing our personal lines sale portal netxpress sm for our agents  including increasing the number of integration points to our rating engine thus eliminating duplicate entry for agents 
these actions have resulted in increased levels of quote activity by our agents 
for our policyholders  we have increased the number of electronic bill pay options  including x online capability  along with introduction of claim reporting technology

net written premiums for the year ended december  increased compared to the same period 
the expansion into texas  colorado  arizona and connecticut contributed to approximately points of this growth in  and rate increases also contributed to this growth 
while growth continues to be strong  we are experiencing a slowdown in new business and a lower issue to quote ratio which we attribute to the impact of our rate increases 
nonstandard auto net written premiums for the year ended december  decreased compared to the same period 
approximately two thirds of this decline was due to the inclusion of the nonstandard auto business in the pooling arrangement effective january  of this business is ceded to the mutual pooled companies 
in august  we announced that stfc had entered into an agreement to sell our nonstandard automobile insurance subsidiary  sa national  which resulted in a slowdown of new business submitted by our agents 
the decline in net written premiums was also due to certain underwriting actions taken in and that included increasing rates and terminating certain agencies that had failed to consistently perform to our expectations 
these actions  coupled with the impact of general economic conditions  continued to result in a reduction of nonstandard auto business 
the actions taken in also contributed to the decline in net written premiums for the year ended december  of compared to the same period

table of contents impacted by rate competition  general economic conditions  and depressed premium bases  such as payrolls  sales and number of vehicles  as well as ease of doing business issues 
after strengthening our premium per exposure on our renewal policies in the second half of  our premium per exposure on policies other than policies issued through red decreased slightly in new business other than red declined in we believe it will be difficult to generate measurable premium growth in our current book of business  other than our red book of business  given the continued impact of the economy on premium bases 
however  we are seeking to balance our traditional underwriting discipline with new products and pricing tools that support the production of profitable new business 
we continue to invest in products  processes and systems that we believe will increase our business insurance writings 
we have implemented a pricing process that we believe will help us price property  liability  auto and workers compensation risks at appropriate levels 
in addition  we have broadened our property  liability  auto and workers compensation pricing ranges to improve our ability to recognize the spectrum of risks within our markets 
we continue to enhance our insurance policy administration system to attempt to make it easier for our agents to quote and submit business insurance policies to us 
our system now allows transactions to be processed throughout the day using real time and straight through processing rather than in large batch cycles at night 
we have leveraged this functionality with bizxpress sm  our web based quote system  to give agents the ability to quote businessowners  commercial auto and workers compensation risks online 
we believe this technology investment should better position us for revenue growth opportunities in the future and start to drive efficiencies into our business model much like we have seen in personal insurance 
the majority of all transactions in business insurance utilize the straight through processing technology 
the use of this technology has resulted in faster delivery of policies to our agents and their insureds for new business and endorsements 
in the third quarter  we expanded our electronic funds transfer billing capability  making it available to business insurance policyholders 
we have also expanded the eligibility of our businessowners product to facilitate businesses with greater liability exposures  such as artisan contractors  auto service garages  manufacturers and restaurants 
while we regularly insure these types of businesses through other insurance products  offering them in our businessowners program leverages our bizxpress technology  simplifies agents rating and submission processes  and offers broader base coverages for these types of risks

the impact of rate increases contributed significantly to the improvement in standard auto 
homeowners also improved relative to  benefitting from rate actions and implementation of mandatory wind and hail deductibles in many of our operating states prone to non cat weather related losses 
in homeowners we continue to file rate increases in the high single digit to low double digit range 
the personal insurance segment overall non cat loss ratio was points higher in than in standard auto s non cat loss ratio increase was driven by an increase in frequency of physical damage  comprehensive and collision coverage claims  while the nonstandard auto increase was caused by a rise in the overall severity of claims 
previously  the intense price competition in the personal lines market had impeded our ability to take appropriate rate increases 
price competition in the personal lines market became less intense  which allowed us to implement rate increases  contributing some to our growth 
the increase in the non cat homeowners loss ratio was due primarily to experiencing more large fire losses and settling one threatened class action claim 
settlement of the one class action claim increased the non cat homeowners loss ratio by points 
in the business insurance segment  the overall non cat loss ratio for the year ended december  increased points compared to the same period 
the commercial auto non cat loss ratio increased points  principally driven by an increase in the number of large losses which impacted both the current and prior accident years 
the other product liability non cat loss ratio increased by points principally driven by an increase in large losses from prior accident years 
intense competition in the business insurance segment continues to impact our ability to implement price increases where needed 
the business insurance segment overall non cat loss ratio for was comparable to however  commercial auto and commercial multi peril loss ratios decreased primarily due to a reduction in the number and size of large losses when compared to the increase in the fire allied lines loss ratio was the result of more large fires in the increase in other product liability was due primarily to an increase in the estimate of internal claim handling expenses 

table of contents initiatives implemented within our claims operations during and are contributing to the overall decline in our loss ratio  particularly in the property lines of homeowners  fire and commercial multi peril 
our dependence on outside appraisers has declined by deploying over in house property adjusters working from their homes 
in addition  virtually all large property claims and a significant percentage of catastrophe claims are now being handled in house by state auto adjusters 
these changes improve service  reduce expenses  and allow us to better manage indemnity payout all of which improves loss ratio results

loss and loss expenses payable increased million since january   primarily due to an increase in large losses for commercial auto and other product liability  as well as growth 
loss and loss expenses payable as of december  increased million from december  the increase  driven by the personal insurance segment  was primarily due to growth in exposures in our standard auto and homeowners business 
we conduct quarterly reviews of loss development reports and make judgments in determining the reserves for ultimate losses and loss expenses payable 
several factors are considered by us when estimating ultimate liabilities including consistency in relative case reserve adequacy  consistency in claims settlement practices  recent legal developments  historical data  actuarial projections  accounting projections  exposure changes  anticipated inflation  current business conditions  catastrophe developments  late reported claims  and other reasonableness tests 
the risks and uncertainties inherent in our estimates include  but are not limited to  actual settlement experience different from historical data  trends  changes in business and economic conditions  court decisions creating unanticipated liabilities  ongoing interpretation of policy provisions by the courts  inconsistent decisions in lawsuits regarding coverage and additional information discovered before settlement of claims 
our results of operations and financial condition could be impacted  perhaps significantly  in the future if the ultimate payments required to settle claims vary from the liability currently recorded

investment operations segment our investment portfolio and the investment portfolios of other members of the state auto group are managed by our subsidiary  stateco 
stateco utilizes its own personnel to invest in fixed maturities and large cap equities and outside investment managers to invest in small cap equities and international funds 
the investment committee the committee of the board of directors establishes the investment policies to be followed by stateco 
our primary investment objectives are to generate income  preserve capital and maintain adequate liquidity for the payment of claims and expenses 
our current investment strategy does not rely on the use of derivative financial instruments 
our decision to make a specific investment is influenced primarily by the following factors a investment risks  b general market conditions  c relative valuations of investment vehicles  d general market interest rates  e our liquidity requirements at any given time  and f our current federal income tax position and relative spread between after tax yields on tax exempt and taxable fixed maturity investments 
we have investment policy guidelines with respect to purchasing fixed maturity investments for our insurance subsidiaries which preclude investments in bonds that are rated below investment grade by a recognized rating service 
for the insurance subsidiaries  the maximum investment in any single note or bond is limited to or less of statutory assets  other than obligations of the us government or government agencies  for which there is no limit 
our fixed maturity portfolio is composed of high quality  investment grade issues  comprised almost entirely of debt issues rated aaa or aa 
at december   there were no fixed maturity investments rated below investment grade in our available for sale investment portfolio 
at december  and  our only investments in mortgage backed securities were in federal agency pools fannie mae and freddie mac and government guaranteed pools ginnie mae 
our internally managed equity portfolio invests in us large cap  dividend paying companies across many different industries selected based upon their potential for appreciation as well as ability to continue paying dividends 
this diversification across companies and industries reduces volatility in the value of the large cap equity portfolio 
in addition  our investment policy guidelines limit the purchase of a specific stock to no more than of the market value of the stock at the time of purchase  and no single equity holding should exceed of the total equity portfolio 
our externally managed equity portfolios invest in us small cap equities and international funds 
these managers are permitted to manage the portfolios according to their own respective portfolio objectives 
in selecting our outside investment managers we confirm that their portfolio objectives  including risk tolerance  are acceptable to us 
however  there may be slight differences in their objectives with respect to dividend payments and other constraints that we apply to our large cap equity holdings 
diversifying our portfolio into small cap equities and international equity funds was designed to achieve a greater total return with reduced volatility 
we believe that in most market cycles  diversification of the portfolio will be beneficial to us  and we plan to continue to maintain a diversified portfolio

at december   our equity portfolio consisted of approximately different large cap stocks and small cap stocks 
the largest single position was of the equity portfolio based on fair value and the top ten positions account for of the equity portfolio 
since our equity portfolio consists primarily of large cap value oriented stocks  with a small allocation to small cap equities  when large cap stocks and or value oriented stocks perform well our equity portfolio typically performs well compared to benchmarks 
conversely  when growth stocks outperform value and or small to mid cap stocks outperform large cap stocks  our equity portfolio does not perform as well compared to benchmarks 
market risk our primary market risk exposures are to changes in market prices for equity securities and changes in interest rates and credit ratings for fixed maturity securities 
our fixed maturity securities are subject to interest rate risk whereby the value of the securities varies as market interest rates change 
we manage this risk by closely monitoring the duration of the fixed maturity portfolio 
the duration of the fixed maturity portfolio was approximately and as of december  and  respectively 
the following table sets forth our interest rate risk and the effects of a parallel change in interest rates on the fair value of the available for sale fixed maturity portfolio at december  millions fair value bps change bps change actual bps change bps change fixed maturities us treasury securities and obligations of us government agencies obligations of states and political subdivisions corporate securities us government agencies residential mortgage backed securities balance as of december  this table summarizes only the effects that a parallel change in interest rates could have on the fixed maturity portfolio 
this change in rates would also change the value of our liabilities and possibly other financial assets 
we caution the reader that this analysis does not take into account nonparallel changes in interest rates 
it is likely that some rates would increase or decrease more than others depending upon market conditions at the time of the change 
this nonparallel change would alter the value of the fixed maturity portfolio 
the analysis is also limited in that it does not take into account any actions that might be taken by us in response to these changes 
as a result  the actual impact of a change in interest rates and the resulting fixed maturity values may differ significantly from what is shown in the table 
we believe that the fixed maturity portfolio s exposure to credit risk is minimal as approximately of the bonds we own are rated aa or better 
we do not intend to change our investment policy on the quality of our fixed maturity investments 
the fixed maturity portfolio is managed in a laddered maturity style and considers business mix and liability payout patterns to ensure adequate cash flow to meet claims as they are presented 
we also manage liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash balances  owning some agency and us treasury securities at all times  purchasing bonds of major issuers  and purchasing bonds that are part of a medium or large issue 
the fixed maturity portfolio does not have any direct exposure to either exchange rate risk or commodity risk 
we do not rely on the use of derivative financial instruments 
to provide us greater flexibility in order to manage our market risk exposures  we categorize our fixed maturities as available for sale 
we do not maintain a trading portfolio 

table of contents we have no mortgage backed securities in our fixed maturity portfolio which may be labeled sub prime mortgage backed securities 
we invest only in conventional mortgage backed securities issued by a federal agency or that are us government guaranteed 
specifically  approximately million or of our available for sale investment portfolio as of december   were in either ginnie mae pools  which are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the us government  or fannie mae or freddie mac pools

our fixed maturity investment portfolio at december  included obligations of states and political subdivisions with a total carrying value of million 
million of these securities  or of our municipal securities portfolio muni portfolio  were enhanced by third party monoline insurers a credit enhancement for the payment of principal and interest in the event of an issuer default 
a credit enhancement is not a primary consideration to us when purchasing a municipal security  as we consider the underlying credit quality of the security as the primary rating factor in our evaluation process 
of the total million of municipal securities in our investment portfolio at december   were rated aa or better  without the benefit of a credit enhancement 
we do not believe that a loss of a credit enhancement would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity  due to the underlying strength of the issuers of the securities  as well as our ability and intent to hold the securities 
in addition  as of december   we had no direct investment in any guarantor including any bond insurer

we have invested in securities which have been either pre refunded or escrowed to maturity bonds 
within the non pre refunded and escrowed to maturity portfolio  no single issuer comprises more than of the portfolio and no more than of the portfolio is concentrated in any one state 
we believe our muni portfolio is invested within the strongest sectors of the municipal bond market 
of our municipal bonds are general obligation bonds or other tax backed bonds 
the majority of the remaining muni portfolio consists of revenue bonds 
our credit research is an important part of our investment management process  and we continually monitor all holdings for any signs of deterioration 
we believe that our municipal holdings will maintain their high credit quality and that the issuers will be able to make all principal and interest payments as they come due

as a result  the actual impact of a change in equity market prices and the resulting equity values may differ significantly from what is shown in the table 
by investing in mostly large cap issues we hope to limit liquidity risk in the equity portfolio 
the large cap equity portfolio does not have any direct exposure to exchange rate risk since we do not directly hold any foreign stocks 
we constantly monitor the equity portfolio holdings for any credit risk issues that may arise 
we do not invest in any commodity futures or commodity oriented mutual funds

average invested assets were  million at december   an increase from  million and  million at december  and  respectively 
our investment yield declined to in from and in and  respectively 
these changes were primarily due to the following factors 
the amount of interest earned on our fixed maturity securities declined due to a shift in this portfolio to holding higher levels of taxable bonds with shorter durations and lower rates of return and fewer long duration tax exempt bonds earning higher rates of return 
also contributing to the decrease in net investment income was an increase in the call activity on our higher yielding bonds when compared to and the amortized cost value of our treasury inflation protected securities tips increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million and million for the same and periods  respectively 
the income earned on our tips securities  which is dependent on changes in the cpi index  increased by million in when compared to the same period  and decreased by million in when compared to the same period 
to offset the decline in interest earned on our fixed maturity securities and to improve yield and cash flows  in we began to hold more high dividend paying equities when compared to in  we held fewer large cap dividend paying stocks than in  and dividend payouts were reduced on certain equity holdings

when a fixed maturity security has been determined to have an other than temporary decline in fair value  the impairment charge is separated into an amount representing the credit loss  which is recognized in earnings  and the amount related to non credit factors  which is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss

we obtain one price per security  and our processes and control procedures are designed to ensure the value is accurately recorded on an unadjusted basis 
through discussions with the pricing service  we gain an understanding of the methodologies used to price the different types of securities  that the data and the valuation 
table of contents methods utilized are appropriate and consistently applied  and that the assumptions are reasonable and representative of fair value 
to validate the reasonableness of the valuations obtained from the pricing service  we compare to other fair value pricing information gathered from other independent pricing sources

other items income taxes for the year ended december   federal income tax expense was less than million compared to a tax benefit of million and million for the same and periods  respectively 
the effective tax rate for of differs from the statutory rate of principally because of tax exempt investment income 
in addition  in we incurred a one time tax charge of million related to the enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act 
this legislation eliminated the tax benefit associated with medicare part d subsidies we receive for providing qualifying prescription drug coverage to retirees 
see note  federal income taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for a reconciliation between our actual federal income tax expense benefit and the amount computed at the indicated statutory rate for the years ended december   and liquidity and capital resources general liquidity refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet our short and long term needs 
our primary sources of cash are premiums  investment income  investment sales and the maturity of fixed income security investments 
the significant outflows of cash are payments of claims  commissions  premium taxes  operating expenses  income taxes  dividends  interest and principal payments on debt and investment purchases 
the cash outflows may vary due to uncertainties regarding settlement of large losses or catastrophe events 
as a result  we continually monitor our investment and reinsurance programs to ensure they are appropriately structured to enable the insurance subsidiaries to meet anticipated short and long term cash requirements without the need to sell investments to meet fluctuations in claim payments 
we maintain a portion of our investment portfolio in relatively short term and highly liquid investments to ensure the immediate availability of funds to pay claims and expenses 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in cash and cash equivalents  and  million and  million  respectively  of total available for sale investments 
included in our fixed maturities available for sale are million and million  respectively  of securities on deposit with insurance regulators as required by law at december  and in addition  substantially all of our fixed maturity and equity securities are traded on public markets 
for a further discussion regarding investments  see investments operations segment included in this item our insurance subsidiaries must have adequate liquidity to ensure that their cash obligations are met 
however  because the stfc pooled companies participate in the pooling arrangement  they do not have the daily liquidity concerns normally associated with an insurance company 
this is because under the terms of the pooling arrangement  state auto mutual receives all premiums and pays all losses and expenses associated with the insurance business produced by the pool participants and then settles the intercompany balances generated by these transactions with the participating companies within days following each quarter end 

table of contents when settling the intercompany balances  state auto mutual provides the pool participants with full credit for the premiums written and net losses paid during the quarter and retains all receivable amounts from insureds and agents and reinsurance recoverable on paid losses from unaffiliated reinsurers 
any receivable amounts that are ultimately deemed to be uncollectible are charged off by state auto mutual and allocated to the pool member on the basis of pool participation 
as a result  we have an off balance sheet credit risk related to the balances due to state auto mutual from insureds  agents and reinsurers  which are offset by the unearned premiums from the respective policies 
while the total amount due to state auto mutual from policyholders and agents is significant  the individual amounts due are relatively small at the policyholder and agency level 
based on historical data  this credit risk exposure is not considered to be material to our financial position  though the impact to income on a quarterly basis may be material 
the state auto group mitigates its exposure to this credit risk through its in house collections unit for both personal and commercial accounts which is supplemented by third party collection service providers 
the amounts deemed uncollectible by state auto mutual and allocated to the stfc pooled companies are included in the other expenses line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
the state auto group s reliance on ceded reinsurance is not significant in comparison to the state auto group s total statutory surplus or our total financial position 
to minimize the risk of reinsurer default  the state auto group cedes only to third party reinsurers who are rated a or better by am best and also utilizes both domestic and international markets to diversify its credit risk 
we utilize reinsurance to limit our loss exposure and contribute to our liquidity and capital position 
for a discussion of our reinsurance arrangements  see reinsurance arrangements included in this item we generally manage our cash flows through current operational activity and maturing investments  without a need to liquidate any of our other investments 
however  should our written premiums decline or paid losses increase significantly  or a combination thereof  our cash flows from operations could be impacted requiring us to liquidate investments at losses 
this action was not necessary in  or despite the increased level of catastrophe losses 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
net cash from operations will vary from period to period if there are significant changes in underwriting results  primarily a combination of the level of premiums written and loss and loss expenses paid  changes in cash flows from investment income or federal income tax activity

while premium receipt levels between years increased  losses paid on catastrophes fluctuated significantly between years  in particular with respect to approximately one third of the catastrophe losses in  primarily hurricane ike  occurred in the last of half of the year  where settlement on much of this claim activity with state auto mutual did not occur until during  and  as permitted by regulations of the internal revenue service  we made cash contributions of million  million and million  respectively  to our defined benefit pension plan on behalf of our employees 
the actuarially determined contribution to our defined benefit pension plan ranges from the minimum amount we would be required to contribute to the maximum amount that would be tax deductible 
amounts contributed in excess of the minimum are deemed voluntary while amounts in excess of the maximum would be subject to an excise tax and may not be deductible for tax purposes 
amounts paid in each of these three years were within the minimum and maximum funding amounts that would be deductible for tax purposes 
the actuarially determined funding amount to the plan is generally not determined until the second quarter with respect to the contribution year  though we currently expect to make a minimum cash contribution to our defined benefit pension plan up to million during for a further discussion regarding our defined benefit pension plan  see critical accounting policies pension and postretirement benefit obligations included in this item

although reinsurance does not legally discharge the individual members of the state auto group from primary liability for the full amount of limits applicable under their policies  it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the extent of the reinsurance ceded 
each member of the state auto group is party to working reinsurance treaties for casualty  workers compensation and property lines with several reinsurers arranged through a reinsurance intermediary 
these agreements are described in more detail below 
we have also secured other reinsurance to limit the net cost of large loss events for certain types of coverage written in certain companies  including reinsurance covering umbrella liability losses up to a limit of million with a maximum of million retention 
the state auto group also makes use of facultative reinsurance for unique risk situations 
the state auto group also participates in state insurance pools and associations 
in general  these pools and associations are state sponsored and or operated  impose mandatory participation by insurers doing business in that state  and offer coverage for hard to place risks at premium rates established by the state sponsor or operator  thereby transferring risk of loss to the participating insurers in exchange for premiums which may not be commensurate with the risk assumed 
the casualty excess of loss reinsurance agreement provides that each company in the state auto group is responsible for the first million of a covered loss 
the reinsurers are responsible for of the excess over million up to million of covered loss

regulatory considerations at december   and  each of our insurance subsidiaries was in compliance with statutory requirements relating to capital adequacy 
the naic utilizes a collection of analytical tools designed to assist state insurance departments with an integrated approach to screening and analyzing the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states 
one such set of analytical tools is key financial ratios that are known in the insurance 
table of contents industry as the iris ratios 
a defined range of results for each ratio has been established by the naic for solvency monitoring 
while management utilizes each of these iris ratios in monitoring our insurance companies operating performance on a statutory accounting basis each of our insurance subsidiaries operates within the defined range for the other measures  the net premiums written to surplus or leverage ratio is monitored to ensure that each of our insurance subsidiaries continue to operate within the defined range of to the higher the leverage ratio  the more risk a company bears in relation to statutory surplus available to absorb losses 
in considering this range  management also considers the distribution of net premiums between property and liability lines of business 
a company with a larger portion of net premiums from liability lines should generally maintain a lower leverage ratio 
the leverage ratios increased in while premiums grew  surplus declined 
of the total million decline in surplus  million was related to the dividends and sale of sa national 
at december   sa national had million in surplus  and of the dividends paid to stfc during  million was contributed from stfc to state auto p c 
offsetting the sa national decline was the unrealized holding gains on investments and net income on the remaining insurance subsidiaries

our insurance subsidiaries pay dividends to state auto financial which in turn may be used by state auto financial to pay dividends to stockholders or to make principal and interest payments on debt 
individual states limit the amount of dividends that our insurance subsidiaries domiciled in those states can pay without prior approval 
under current law  million is available in for payment as a dividend from our insurance subsidiaries to state auto financial  without prior approval from our respective domiciliary state insurance departments 
in  and  state auto financial received million  million and million  respectively in dividends from its insurance subsidiaries 
we are required to notify the insurance subsidiaries applicable state insurance commissioner within five business days after declaration of all such dividends and at least ten days prior to payment 
additionally  the domiciliary state commissioner of each insurance subsidiary has the authority to limit a dividend when the commissioner determines  based on factors set forth in the law  that an insurer s surplus is not reasonable in relation to the insurer s outstanding liabilities and adequate to meet its financial needs 
such restrictions are not expected to limit the capacity of state auto financial to meet its cash obligations 
state auto financial s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states in which they do business 
the naic has developed risk based capital requirements  which attempts to relate an individual insurance company s statutory surplus to the risk inherent in its overall operations

our ratings are influenced by many factors including operating and financial performance  asset quality  liquidity  financial leverage  exposure to catastrophe risks and operating leverage 
presently  our am best ratings are assigned negative outlooks  whereas  moody s and standard poor s ratings are assigned stable outlooks 
in may  standard poor s lowered our credit rating from bbb to bbb and our financial strength rating from a to a primarily because of our recent operating and financial results in comparison to our historical results  among other factors 
other impact of inflation inflation can have a significant impact on property and casualty insurers because premium rates are established before the amount of losses and loss expenses are known 
when establishing rates  we attempt to anticipate increases from inflation subject to the limitations of modeling economic variables 
even when general inflation  as measured by the consumer price index  is relatively modest  as has been the case over the last several years  price inflation on the goods and services purchased by insurance companies in settling claims can steadily increase 
for example  medical care costs have risen at a higher rate than general inflation over the last few years 
costs for building materials typically rise dramatically following widespread natural catastrophes  such as the industry experienced in with hurricane ike and with hurricane katrina 
we continue to adjust our pricing projections to reflect current and anticipated changes in costs in all lines of business 
we consider inflation when estimating liabilities for losses and loss expenses  particularly for claims having a long period between occurrence and final settlement 
the liabilities for losses and loss expenses are management s best estimates of the ultimate net cost of underlying claims and expenses and are not discounted for the time value of money 
in times of high inflation  the normally higher yields on investment income may partially offset potentially higher claims and expenses 

table of contents new accounting standards adoption of recent accounting pronouncements amendments to accounting for variable interest entities in june  the fasb issued revised guidance on the accounting for variable interest entities

the revised guidance eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity and replaces the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation of the previous guidance for determining which company  if any  has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
the revised guidance requires an analysis of whether a company has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb the losses that could potentially be significant to the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the entity 
an entity is required to be re evaluated as a variable interest entity when the holders of the equity investment at risk  as a group  lose the power from voting rights or similar rights to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
additional disclosures are required about a company s involvement in variable interest entities and an ongoing assessment of whether a company is the primary beneficiary

for level fair value measurements  information in the reconciliation of recurring level measurements about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements shall be presented separately on a gross basis  rather than as one net number 
in addition  clarification is provided about existing disclosure requirements  such as presenting fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities that are determined based on their nature and risk characteristics and their placement in the fair value hierarchy that is  level   or  as opposed to each major category of assets and liabilities  as required in the previous guidance 
disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements are required for fair value measurement that fall in either level or level we adopted this new guidance effective january   except for the gross presentation of purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the level reconciliation  which is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december  the disclosures required by this new guidance are provided in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements
