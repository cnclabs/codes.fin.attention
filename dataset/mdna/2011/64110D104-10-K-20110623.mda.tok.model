risk factors the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form k should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations 
please see item business forward looking statements of this annual report on form k for a discussion of the forward looking statements that are qualified by these risk factors 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occurs  our business  operating results  and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our operating results may be adversely affected by uncertain economic and market conditions 
we are subject to the effects of general global economic and market conditions 
challenging economic conditions worldwide or in certain geographic regions have from time to time contributed to slowdowns in the computer  storage  and networking industries at large  as well as the information technology it market  resulting in reduced demand for our products as a result of constraints on it related spending by our customers  increased price competition for our products from competitors  deferment of purchases and orders by customers due to budgetary constraints or changes in current or planned utilization of our systems  risk of excess and obsolete inventories  risk of supply constraints excess facilities costs  higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenues  
table of contents negative impacts from increased financial pressures on customers  distributors and resellers  negative impacts from increased financial pressures on key suppliers or contract manufacturers  and potential discontinuance of product lines or businesses and related asset impairments 
any of the above mentioned factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business and financial performance 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate  which could adversely impact our common stock price 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
our operating results have been in the past  and will continue to be  subject to quarterly fluctuations as a result of numerous factors  some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations during times of economic volatility 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following fluctuations in demand for our products and services  in part due to changes in general economic conditions and specific economic conditions in the storage and data management market  a shift in federal government spending patterns  changes in sales and implementation cycles for our products and reduced visibility into our customers spending plans and associated revenues  the level of price and product competition in our target markets  the impact of economic uncertainty on our customers budgets and it spending capacity  our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels and purchase commitments  our reliance on a limited number of suppliers  and industry consolidation in our supply base  which could subject us to periodic supply and demand  price rigidity  and quality issues with our components  the timing of bookings  the cancellation of significant orders and the management of  or fluctuations in  our backlog  product configuration and mix  the extent to which our customers renew their service and maintenance contracts with us  seasonality  such as our historical seasonal decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal year and seasonal increase in revenues in the second quarter of our fiscal year  with the latter due in part to the impact of the us federal government s september fiscal year end on the timing of its orders  linearity  such as our historical intraquarter bookings and revenue pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter s total bookings and related revenue occur in the last month of the quarter  announcements and introductions of  and transitions to  new products by us or our competitors  deferrals of customer orders in anticipation of new products or product enhancements introduced by us or our competitors  our ability to develop  introduce  and market new products and enhancements in a timely manner  our ability to effectively integrate acquired products and technologies  our levels of expenditure on research and development and sales and marketing programs  our ability to effectively manage our operating expenses  adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates in the countries in which we do business  the dilutive impact of our billion of convertible senior notes due june the notes and related warrants on our earnings per share  
table of contents excess or inadequate facilities  actual events  circumstances  outcomes and amounts differing from judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in determining the values of certain assets including the amounts of valuation allowances  liabilities  and other items reflected in our consolidated financial statements  disruptions resulting from new systems and processes as we continue to enhance and scale our system infrastructure  disruptions resulting from reliance on third party systems and processes during the transition period following the completion of mergers or other acquisitions  and future accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting rules  such as the increased use of fair value measures  changes in accounting standards related to revenue recognition  lease accounting  and financial instruments and the potential requirement that us registrants prepare financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs 
due to such factors  operating results for future periods are difficult to predict  and  therefore  prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods 
any of the foregoing factors  or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
it is possible that in one or more quarters our results may fall below our forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the trading price of our common stock would likely decrease 
our revenues for a particular period are difficult to forecast  and a shortfall in revenues may harm our business and our operating results 
our revenues for a particular period are difficult to forecast  especially in times of economic uncertainty 
because the storage and data management market is rapidly evolving  our sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer  and we rely increasingly on sales through our indirect channel partners  including value added resellers  systems integrators  distributors  oems and strategic business partners 
new product introductions and the transition from old to new products also increase the complexities of forecasting revenues 
in addition  we derive a majority of our revenues in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter 
bookings typically follow intra quarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter 
if we do not achieve bookings in the latter part of a quarter consistent with our quarterly targets  our financial results will be adversely impacted 
additionally  due to the complexities associated with revenue recognition  we may not accurately forecast our non deferred and deferred revenues  which could adversely impact our results of operations 
we use a pipeline system  a common industry practice  to forecast bookings and trends in our business 
sales personnel monitor the status of potential business and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision  the dollar amount of the sale and the products or services to be sold 
these estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a bookings pipeline 
our pipeline estimates may prove to be unreliable either in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time  in part because the conversion rate of the pipeline into revenues varies from customer to customer  can be difficult to estimate  and requires management judgment  and also because customers purchasing decisions are subject to delay  reduction or cancellation 
small deviations from our forecasted conversion rate may result in inaccurate plans and budgets and could materially and adversely impact our business or our planned results of operations 
in addition  the risks inherent in using a pipeline system are magnified with respect to indirect sales made through our channel partners because we have less control over  and visibility into  the sales process of our channel partners 
economic uncertainties have caused  and may in the future again cause  consumers  businesses and governments to defer purchases in response to tighter budgets  credit  decreased cash availability and declining customer confidence 
accordingly  future demand for our products could differ from our current expectations 

table of contents we have experienced periods of alternating growth and decline in revenues and operating expenses 
if we are not able to successfully manage these fluctuations  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be significantly impacted 
changing market conditions and economic uncertainty create a challenging operating environment for our business 
it is critical that we maintain appropriate alignment between our cost structure and our expected growth and revenues  while at the same time  continuing to make strategic investments for future growth 
our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future revenues  and a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed 
we have a limited ability to quickly or significantly reduce our fixed costs  and if revenue levels are below our expectations  operating results will be adversely impacted 
during periods of uneven growth  we may incur costs before we realize the anticipated related benefits  which could harm our operating results 
we have made  and will continue to make  significant investments in engineering  sales  service and support  marketing programs and other functions to support and grow our business 
we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the related anticipated benefits revenue growth  and the return on these investments may be lower  or may develop more slowly  than we expect  which could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
conversely  if we are unable to effectively manage our resources and capacity during periods of increasing demand for our products  we could also experience an adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition and our customer relationships may be adversely impacted 
if the storage and data management market fails to grow  or grows slower than we expect  our revenues will be adversely affected 
also  even if spending in the it market increases  our revenues may not grow at the same pace 
our gross margins have varied over time and may continue to vary  and such variation makes it more difficult to forecast our earnings 
our total gross margins are impacted by the mix of our product  software entitlements and maintenance and services revenues 
our product gross margins have been and may continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including demand for storage and data management products  pricing actions  rebates  sales initiatives  discount levels  and price competition  changes in the mix between direct versus indirect and oem sales  particularly as a result of the recent acquisition of certain assets related to the engenio external storage systems business esg of lsi corporation lsi  which is based on a lower gross margin oem business model  changes in customer  geographic  or product mix  including mix of configurations within products  the timing and amount of revenue recognized and deferred  new product introductions and enhancements  licensing and royalty arrangements  excess inventory levels or purchase commitments as a result of changes in demand forecasts or last time buy purchases  possible product and software defects as we transition our products  and the cost of components  contract manufacturing costs  quality  warranty  and freight 

table of contents changes in software entitlements and maintenance gross margins may result from various factors  such as the size of the installed base of products under support contracts  the timing of technical support service contract renewals  and demand for and the timing of delivery of upgrades 
changes in service gross margins may result from various factors  such as the mix of customers  the size and timing of service contract renewals  spares stocking requirements to support new product introductions  the level of spending on our customer support infrastructure  the volume  cost and use of outside partners to deliver support services on our behalf  and product quality and serviceability issues 
due to such factors  gross margins are subject to variation from period to period and are difficult to predict 
an increase in competition and industry consolidation could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
the storage and data management markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology 
in the storage market  our primary and near line storage system products and our associated software portfolio compete primarily with storage system products and data management software from emc including its recent acquisition of isilon  hitachi data systems  hp  ibm  dell and oracle corporation 
in the secondary storage market  which includes the disk to disk backup  compliance and business continuity segments  our solutions compete primarily against products from emc and oracle corporation 
there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years 
we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry  as companies become unable to maintain their competitive positions or continue operations and as customers demand more flexible business models and terms 
we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete for customers as sole source vendors 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish strategic alliances among themselves or with third parties  including some of our partners 
it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors 
competitive pressures we face could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
disruption of  or changes in  our distribution model could harm our sales 
if we fail to develop and maintain strong relationships with our channel partners  or if our channel partners fail to effectively manage the sale of our products or services on our behalf  our revenues and gross margins could be adversely affected 
we market and sell our storage data management solutions directly through our worldwide sales force and indirectly through channel partners such as value added resellers  systems integrators  distributors  oems and strategic business partners  and we derive a significant portion of our revenues from these indirect channels 
during fiscal  revenues generated from sales through our indirect channel distribution accounted for of our revenues  and we expect this percentage to continue to increase over time as we further develop these channels or acquire products distributed through indirect channels 
in order for us to maintain or increase our revenues  we must effectively manage our relationships with channel partners 

table of contents several factors could result in disruption of or changes in our indirect channel distribution model  which could materially harm our revenues and gross margins  including the following our indirect channel partners may compete directly with other channel partners or with our direct sales force 
due to these conflicts  our indirect channel partners could stop or reduce their efforts in marketing our products 
our indirect channel partners may demand that we absorb a greater share of the risks that their customers may ask them to bear  our indirect channel partners may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes and challenges in business conditions  and our indirect channel partners financial condition or operations may weaken 
there is no assurance that we will be able to attract new indirect channel partners  retain these indirect channel partners or that we will be able to secure additional or replacement indirect channel partners in the future  especially in light of changes in end customer demand patterns and changes in available and competing technologies from competitors 
the loss of one or more of our key indirect channel partners in a given geographic area could harm our operating results within that area  as qualifying and developing new indirect channel partners typically requires a significant investment of time and resources before acceptable levels of productivity are met 
our inability to effectively establish  train  retain and manage our indirect channel partners could harm our sales 
in addition  we depend on our indirect channel partners to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate 
their failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 
our oem relationship with ibm may not continue to generate significant revenues 
in april  we entered into an oem agreement with ibm  which enables ibm to sell ibm branded solutions based on our unified solutions  including nearstore and v series systems  as well as associated software offerings 
in addition  by acquiring esg  we have assumed lsi s rights under a second oem agreement with ibm  which enables ibm to sell certain esg solutions 
while these agreements are part of our general strategy to expand our reach to more customers and into more countries  we do not have an exclusive relationship with ibm under either oem agreement  and there is no minimum commitment for any given period of time 
therefore  our relationship with ibm may not continue to generate significant revenues or  in the case of the oem agreement related to esg  may not allow us to capture certain anticipated benefits of the esg acquisition 
in addition  we have no control over the products that ibm selects to sell  or its release schedule and timing of those products  nor do we control its pricing 
in the event that sales through our oem relationship with ibm increase  which we expect will occur as a result of the esg transaction  we may experience distribution channel conflicts between our direct sales force and the oem or among our channel partners 
if we fail to minimize channel conflicts  or if our oem relationship does not continue to generate significant revenues  our operating results and financial condition could be harmed 
a portion of our revenues is generated by large  recurring purchases from various customers  resellers and distributors 
a loss  cancellation or delay in purchases by any of these parties has and in the future could negatively affect our revenues 
during fiscal  sales to distributors arrow electronics  inc and avnet  inc accounted for approximately and  respectively of our net revenues 
we also have significant oem agreements with ibm  which  as described above  enable ibm to sell ibm branded solutions based on our solutions  as well as an agreement with fujitsu technology solutions fujitsu  which enables fujitsu to lease  sell  market and resell our 
table of contents products to end users and fujitsu sales partners worldwide  to integrate our products into fujitsu bundled offerings  and to market our support services 
the loss of orders from these  or any of our more significant customers  strategic partners  distributors or resellers could cause our revenues and profitability to suffer 
we generally do not enter into binding purchase commitments with our customers for an extended period of time  and thus we may not be able to continue to receive large  recurring orders from these customers  resellers or distributors 
for example  our reseller agreements generally do not require minimum purchases and our customers  resellers and distributors can stop purchasing and marketing our products at any time 
unfavorable economic conditions may negatively impact our operations by affecting the solvency of our customers  resellers and distributors  or the ability of our customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products 
if the uncertainty in the economy continues  or conditions deteriorate  and our sales decline  our financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted 
because our expenses are based on our revenue forecasts  a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to  or unexpected returns from customers and resellers  or the loss of any significant customer or reseller  could harm our business 
we expect that our largest customers in the future could be different from our largest customers today 
end users could stop purchasing and indirect channel partners could stop marketing our products at any time 
the loss of one or more of our key indirect channel partners or the failure to obtain and ship a number of large orders each quarter could harm our operating results 
in addition  a change in the pricing practices of one or more of our large indirect channel partners could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins 
the us government has contributed to our revenue growth and has become an important customer for us 
future revenues from the us government are subject to shifts in government spending patterns 
a decrease in government demand for our products could materially affect our revenues 
in addition  our business could be adversely affected as a result of future examinations by the us government 
the us government has become an important customer for the storage and data management market generally and for us in particular  however  government demand is unpredictable  and there can be no assurance that we will maintain or grow our revenues from the us government 
government agencies are subject to budgetary processes and expenditure constraints that could lead to delays or decreased capital expenditures in it spending 
if the government or individual agencies within the government reduce or shift their capital spending patterns  our revenues and operating results may be harmed 
in addition  selling our products to the us government  whether directly or indirectly  also subjects us to certain regulatory requirements 
for example  in april  we entered into a settlement agreement with the united states of america  acting through the united states department of justice doj and on behalf of the general services administration the gsa related to a dispute regarding our discount practices and compliance with the price reduction clause provisions of gsa contracts for certain specified prior years 
failure to comply with us government regulatory requirements by us or our reseller partners could subject us to fines and other penalties  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  operating results and financial position 
if we are unable to maintain our existing relationships and develop new relationships with major strategic partners  our revenues may be impacted negatively 
an element of our strategy to increase revenues is to strategically partner with major third party software and hardware vendors to integrate our products into their products and also co market our products with them 
we have significant partner relationships with database  business application  backup management and server virtualization companies  including microsoft  oracle  sap  symantec and vmware 
in january  we announced an expansion of our collaboration with cisco and vmware  including a cooperative support arrangement  and in october  we expanded our relationship with fujitsu technology solutions 
a number 
table of contents of these strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage and data management market 
there is intense competition for attractive strategic partners  and even if we can establish relationships with these or other partners  these partnerships may not generate significant revenues or may not continue to be in effect for any specific period of time 
if these relationships are not maintained or fail to materialize as expected  we could experience lower than expected revenue growth  suffer delays in product development  or experience other operational difficulties 
in addition  some of our partners  including oracle  cisco and vmware  are also partnering with other storage vendors which may increase the availability of competing solutions  harm our ability to continue as the vendor of choice for those partners and harm our ability to grow our business with those partners 
we intend to continue to establish and maintain business relationships with technology companies to expand our marketing reach and accelerate the development of our storage and data management solutions 
to the extent that we are unsuccessful in developing new relationships or maintaining our existing relationships  our future revenues and operating results could be negatively impacted 
in addition  the loss of a strategic partner could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 
our future financial performance depends on growth in the storage and data management markets 
if the performance of these markets does not meet the expectations upon which we calculate and forecast our revenues  our operating results will be materially and adversely impacted 
all of our products address the storage and data management markets 
accordingly  our future financial performance will depend in large part on continued growth in the storage and data management markets and on our ability to adapt to emerging standards in these markets 
the markets for storage and data management have been recently adversely impacted by the global economic uncertainty  and as a result of continued uncertainty  the markets may not grow as anticipated or may decline 
additionally  emerging standards in these markets may adversely affect the unix  windows and the world wide web server markets upon which we depend 
for example  we provide our open access data retention solutions to customers within the financial services  healthcare  pharmaceutical and government market segments  industries that are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with respect to data access  reliability and permanence such as rule a of the securities exchange act of  as amended in the united states and in the other countries in which we operate 
if our products do not meet and continue to comply with these evolving governmental regulations in this regard  customers in these market and geographical segments will not purchase our products  and we will not be able to expand our product offerings in these market and geographical segments at the rates which we have forecasted 
supply chain issues  including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers  or a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increases our costs or causes a delay in our ability to fulfill orders  could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results  and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply  which could adversely affect our gross margins 
the fact that we do not own or operate our manufacturing facilities and supply chain exposes us to risks  including reduced control over quality assurance  production costs and product supply  which could have a material adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our business and operating results 
we rely on a limited number of suppliers for components utilized in the assembly of our products  which has and could subject us to future periodic supply constraints and price rigidity 
in addition  pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement we entered into with lsi in connection with the acquisition of certain assets related to esg  we have the right to place orders with contract manufacturers and suppliers through lsi and access lsi s systems in order to help us manage the esg business for a period of time following the acquisition 
financial problems of either contract manufacturers  component suppliers or other parties in our supply chain  including lsi  and reservation 
table of contents of manufacturing capacity at our contract manufacturers by other companies  inside or outside of our industry  could either limit supply or increase costs of our products 
qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production is expensive and time consuming  and disruption or termination of manufacturing capacity with respect to any contract manufacturer could negatively impact our ability to manufacture and sell our products 
we intend to regularly introduce new products and product enhancements  which will require us to rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating with our contract manufacturers and suppliers 
a reduction or interruption in supply  a significant increase in the price of one or more components  a failure to adequately procure inventory by our contract manufacturers  a failure to timely cancel  reschedule  or adjust our requirements based on our business needs  or a decrease in demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships 
furthermore  as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers  we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market 
in the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used  our gross margins could decrease 
as the demand for our products has increased  we have experienced  and may continue to experience tightening of supply of some components leading to longer lead times and component supply constraints  which has resulted in and in the future could continue to result in the delay of shipments 
our business operations are subject to business interruptions and other events beyond our control 
such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to receive components from our suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain 
our acquisitions may disrupt our existing business and harm our results of operations 
as part of our strategy  we are continuously evaluating opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that would complement our current products  expand the breadth of our markets  or enhance our technical capabilities 
in fiscal year  we completed acquisitions of two technology companies  and on may   we completed the acquisition of certain assets related to esg 
the acquisition and ongoing integration of new businesses into our business may adversely affect our operations or profitability 
we may not achieve the anticipated cost savings and synergies or realize our estimated revenue  gross margin  profit or other financial projections or business objectives in a timely manner or at all due to a number of factors  including the following the inability to successfully integrate the operations  technologies  products  personnel and business systems of the acquired companies  in the case of an asset purchase  the failure to acquire all of the assets necessary to operate the acquired business  the diversion of management s attention from normal daily operations of the existing business  the loss of key employees of the acquired business could adversely impact our ability to manage the business and our ability to realize our financial forecasts  the inability to retain the customers and partners of acquired businesses following the acquisition  substantial transaction costs and accounting charges  and exposure to litigation related to acquisitions 
acquisitions may also result in risks to our existing business  including deterioration of our internal control over financial reporting as a result of inconsistencies between our standards  procedures and policies and those of the acquired business  reliance on the selling party s processes  data  supply chain management and reporting during the transition period following the completion of an acquisition  
table of contents dilution of our current stockholders percentage ownership to the extent we issue new equity  assumption of additional liabilities  incurrence of additional debt or a decline in available cash  adverse effects to our financial statements  such as the need to incur restructuring charges  liability for intellectual property infringement and other litigation claims  which we may or may not be aware of at the time of acquisition  and creation of goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant future amortization expense or impairment charges 
the failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition may also result in impairment charges for goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
for example  we have in the past discontinued certain products which were originally acquired through business acquisitions 
additional or realized risks of this nature could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are exposed to the credit and non payment risk of our customers  resellers  and distributors  especially during times of economic uncertainty and tight credit markets  which could result in material losses 
most of our sales to customers are on an open credit basis  with typical payment terms of days 
while we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements  and seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe are reasonable  we may experience losses due to a customer s inability to pay 
beyond our open credit arrangements  we also have recourse and nonrecourse customer financing leasing arrangements using third party leasing companies 
under the terms of recourse leases  which are treated as off balance sheet arrangements  we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the third party leasing company in the event of end user customer default 
we also offer financing arrangements whereby the end user customer pays a fixed monthly amount plus a variable amount based on actual storage capacity used 
these arrangements subject us to additional risk with respect to revenue recognition and profitability due to the uncertainties associated with the variable portion of the arrangements 
in addition  from time to time we provide guarantees for a portion of other financing arrangements under which we could be called upon to make payments to our funding parties in the event of nonpayment by end user customers 
we expect demand for customer financing to continue 
during periods of economic uncertainty  our exposure to credit risks from our customers increases 
in addition  our exposure to credit risks of our customers may increase further if our customers and their customers or their lease financing sources are adversely affected by global economic conditions 
in the past  there have been bankruptcies by our customers to whom we had extended open credit or provided lease financing arrangements  causing us to incur bad debt charges  and  in the case of financing arrangements  a loss of revenues 
we may be subject to similar losses in future periods 
any future losses could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
additionally  to the extent that the recent turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for customers to obtain open credit or lease financing  those customers ability to purchase our products could be adversely impacted  which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 

table of contents the market price for our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future 
the market price for our common stock has experienced substantial volatility in the past  and several factors could cause substantial fluctuation in the future 
these factors include but are not limited to fluctuations in our operating results compared to prior periods and forecasts  variations between our operating results and either the guidance we have furnished to the public or the published expectations of securities analysts  industry consolidation and the resulting perception of increased competition  economic developments in the storage and data management market as a whole  fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us  changes in analysts recommendations or projections  changes in our relationships with our suppliers  customers  channel and strategic partners  announcements of the completion or dissolution of strategic alliances within the industry  dilutive impacts of our convertible notes and related warrants  international conflicts and acts of terrorism  announcements of new products  applications  or product enhancements by us or our competitors  announcements related to planned or completed mergers or other acquisitions by us or our competitors  inquiries by the sec  nasdaq  law enforcement  or other regulatory bodies  and general market conditions  including recent global or regional economic uncertainties 
in addition  the stock market has experienced volatility that has particularly affected the market prices of the equity securities of many technology companies 
certain macroeconomic factors such as changes in interest rates  the market climate for the technology sector  and levels of corporate spending on it  could continue to have an impact on the trading price of our stock  and the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future 
changes in market conditions have led  and in the future could lead  to charges related to the discontinuance of certain of our products and asset impairments 
in response to changes in economic conditions and market demands  we may decide to strategically realign our resources and consider cost containment measures including restructuring  disposing of  or otherwise discontinuing certain products 
any decision to limit investment in  dispose of  or otherwise exit products may result in the recording of charges to earnings  including inventory and technology related or other intangible asset write offs  workforce reduction costs  charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities  cancellation penalties or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products  which would harm our operating results 
our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets  including purchased intangible assets  could change as a result of such assessments and decisions 
additionally  we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis  and between annual tests in certain circumstances when impairment indicators exist or if certain events or changes in circumstances have occurred 
future goodwill impairment tests may result in charges to earnings  which could materially harm our operating results 

table of contents if we are unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to technological change  if our new products do not achieve market acceptance  if we fail to manage the interoperability and transition between our new and old products  or if we cannot provide the expected level of service and support for our new products  our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products 
due to the complexity of storage subsystems and storage security appliances and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products  such products are subject to significant technical risks 
in addition  our new products must respond to technological changes and evolving industry standards 
if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  or if such products do not achieve market acceptance  our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
new or additional product introductions increase the complexities of forecasting revenues  and subject us to additional financial and operational risks 
if they are not managed effectively  we could experience material risks to our operations  financial condition and business model 
as new or enhanced products are introduced  we must attempt to successfully manage the interoperability and transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in customers ordering patterns  avoid excessive levels of older product inventories  and ensure that enough supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customers demands 
as we enter new or emerging markets  we will likely increase demands on our service and support operations and may be exposed to additional competition 
we may not be able to provide products  service and support to effectively compete for these market opportunities 
due to the global nature of our business  risks inherent in our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
although a substantial portion of our business is located and conducted in the united states  a significant portion of our operations are located  and a significant portion of our revenues are derived  outside of the united states 
during fiscal  our international revenues accounted for of our total revenues 
a substantial portion of our products are manufactured outside of the us  and we have research and development and service centers overseas 
accordingly  our business and our future operating results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors affecting our international operations  some of which are beyond our control  including regulatory  political  or economic conditions in a specific country or region  trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements  government spending patterns  and acts of terrorism and international conflicts 
in addition  we may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve  and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 
our international sales are denominated in us dollars and in foreign currencies 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore potentially less competitive in foreign markets 
conversely  lowering our price in local currency may result in lower us based revenues 
a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase operating expenses in foreign markets 
additionally  we have exposures to emerging market currencies  which can experience extreme volatility 
we utilize forward and option contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposure associated with certain assets and liabilities as well as anticipated foreign currency cash flows on a short term basis 
all balance sheet hedges are marked to market through earnings every quarter 
the time value component of our cash flow hedges is recorded in earnings while all other gains and losses are marked to market through other comprehensive income until forecasted transactions occur  at which time such realized gains and losses are recognized in earnings 
these hedges attempt to reduce  but do not always entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange movements 
factors that could have a 
table of contents negative impact on the effectiveness of our hedging program include inaccuracies in forecasting  widening interest rate differentials  and volatility in the foreign exchange market 
our hedging strategies may not be successful and currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
additional risks inherent in our international business activities generally include  among others  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in managing international operations 
in addition  due to the global nature of our business  we are subject to complex legal and regulatory requirements in the united states and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and sell our products  including antitrust and anti competition laws  rules and regulations  general import export restrictions  and regulations related to data privacy 
for example  united states government export restrictions impede our ability to sell our products to certain end users 
the united states  through the bureau of industry security  places restrictions on the export of certain encryption technology 
these restrictions may include the requirement to have a license to export the technology  the requirement to have software licenses approved before export is allowed  and outright bans on the licensing of certain encryption technology to particular end users or to all end users in a particular country 
our products are subject to various levels of export restrictions 
these export restrictions could negatively impact our business 
we are also subject to the potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy  misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than us laws 
such factors could have an adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial position 
moreover  in many foreign countries  particularly in those with developing economies  it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures  or us laws and regulations applicable to us  such as the foreign corrupt practices act 
there can be no assurance that all of our employees  contractors and agents  as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations  will comply with these policies  procedures  laws and or regulations 
any such violation could subject us to fines and other penalties  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
changes in our effective tax rate or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 
our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors  many of which are outside of our control  including earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we are taxed at lower rates as compared to the us statutory tax rate  material differences between forecasted and actual tax rates as a result of a shift in the mix of pretax profits and losses by tax jurisdiction  our ability to use tax credits  or effective tax rates by tax jurisdiction that differ from our estimates  changing tax laws or related interpretations  accounting standards  regulations  and interpretations in multiple tax jurisdictions in which we operate  as well as the requirements of certain tax rulings  an increase in expenses not deductible for tax purposes  including certain stock based compensation expense  write offs of acquired in process research and development  and impairment of goodwill  the tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between reporting periods  changes related to our ability to ultimately realize future benefits attributed to our deferred tax assets  including those related to other than temporary impairments  tax assessments resulting from income tax audits or any related tax interest or penalties could significantly affect our income tax provision for the period in which the settlements take place  and a change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings 

table of contents we receive significant tax benefits from sales to our non us customers 
these benefits are contingent upon existing tax laws and regulations in the united states and in the countries in which our international operations are located 
future changes in domestic or international tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits 
we have not provided for united states federal and state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
the obama administration and congress have announced several proposals to reform united states tax rules  including proposals that may result in a reduction or elimination of the deferral of united states income tax on our future unrepatriated earnings 
should such anti deferral provisions be enacted  our effective tax rate could be adversely affected 
we are currently undergoing federal income tax audits in the united states and several foreign tax jurisdictions 
the rights to some of our intellectual property ip are owned by certain of our foreign subsidiaries  and payments are made between us and foreign tax jurisdictions relating to the use of this ip in a qualified cost sharing arrangement 
in recent years  several other us companies have had their foreign ip arrangements challenged as part of irs examinations  which has resulted in material proposed assessments and or litigation with respect to those companies 
during fiscal year  we received notices of proposed adjustments from the irs in connection with a federal income tax audit of our fiscal and tax returns 
we filed a protest with the irs in response to the notices of proposed adjustments and subsequently received a rebuttal from the irs examination team in response to our protest 
in april  we executed a closing agreement with the irs appeals office to close this examination 
the notices of proposed adjustments in this audit focused primarily on issues relating to the timing and the amount of income recognized  deductions taken and on the level of cost allocations made to foreign operations during the audit years 
the settlement of our irs examination resulted in additional liability of million  which is almost entirely offset by net operating loss carryforwards 
as a result of the examination settlement  we have reduced our reserve for uncertain tax positions and recognized a net benefit of million 
during fiscal year  the irs commenced the examination of our fiscal through federal income tax returns  and in addition  the california franchise tax board began the examination of our fiscal and california income tax returns 
these audits are currently in progress 
on september   the danish tax authorities issued a decision concluding that distributions declared in and from the company s danish subsidiary  for which the company has not paid or accrued any taxes  are subject to danish at source dividend withholding tax 
the company has appealed this assessment decision with the danish national tax tribunal 
if the ultimate determination of income taxes or at source withholding taxes assessed under the current irs audits or under audits being conducted in any of the other tax jurisdictions in which we operate results in an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for  our operating results  cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our international operations currently benefit from a tax ruling concluded in the netherlands which expires on april  and results in a lower level of earnings subject to tax in the netherlands 
if we are unable to negotiate a similar tax ruling upon expiration of the current ruling  our effective tax rate could increase and our operating results could be adversely affected 
our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by different and evolving interpretations of existing law or regulations  which in turn would negatively impact our operating and financial results as a whole 
our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected if there is a change in international operations and how the operations are managed and structured 
the price of our common stock could decline to the extent that our financial results are materially affected by an adverse change in our effective tax rate 

table of contents our leverage and debt service obligations and note conversion may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and earnings per share 
as a result of the sale of our notes  we have a greater amount of debt than we have maintained in the past 
in addition  we have various synthetic lease arrangements related to some of our facilities at our corporate headquarters in sunnyvale  california  and  subject to the restrictions in our existing and any future financing agreements  we may incur additional debt 
our maintenance of higher levels of indebtedness could have adverse consequences including impacting our ability to satisfy our obligations  increasing the portion of our cash flows from operations that may have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may not be available for operations  working capital  capital expenditures  expansion  acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes  impairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry  and making us more vulnerable to downturns in our business  our industry or the economy in general 
our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance  which will be affected by financial  business  economic  regulatory and other factors 
we will not be able to control many of these factors  such as economic conditions and governmental regulations 
furthermore  our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our expenses and service our debt 
as a result  we may be required to repatriate funds from our foreign subsidiaries which could result in a significant tax liability to us 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations  or if we are unable to repatriate sufficient or any funds from our foreign subsidiaries  in order to meet our expenses and debt service obligations  we may need to enter into new financing arrangements to obtain the necessary funds  or we may be required to raise additional funds through other means 
if we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason  we may not be able to obtain such funding or  if funding is available  obtain it on acceptable terms 
if we fail to make a payment on our debt  we could be in default on such debt  and this default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness 
any conversion of our notes may cause dilution to our shareholders and to our earnings per share 
if the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price  initially per share  the notes will cause an increase in diluted share count and result in lower reported earnings per share 
for at least trading days during the consecutive trading days ended march   our common stock price exceeded the conversion threshold price of per share set forth for these notes 
accordingly  the notes are convertible at the holder s option through june  based on the trading price of our common stock on april   we had approximately million shares of common stock potentially issuable on conversion of our notes 
upon conversion of any notes  we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the notes and  with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the notes  shares of our common stock  which would result in dilution to our shareholders 
the note hedges and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the sale of the notes may affect the trading price of our common stock 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with certain option counterparties the counterparties  which are expected to offset the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the notes 
at the same time  we also entered into warrant transactions with the counterparties pursuant to which we may issue shares of our common stock above a certain strike price 
in connection with these hedging transactions  the counterparties may have entered into various over the counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock or purchased shares of our common stock in secondary market transactions at or following the pricing of the notes 
such activities may have had the effect of increasing the price of our common stock 
the counterparties are likely to modify their hedge positions 
table of contents from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock or entering into other derivative transactions 
additionally  these transactions may expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance 
the effect  if any  of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the notes will depend  in part  on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time  but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock 
in addition  if our stock price exceeds the strike price for the warrants  there could be additional dilution to our shareholders  which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 
in april  we terminated our note hedge transaction with lehman brothers otc derivatives  inc lehman otc  which was a counterparty to of our note hedges  as a result of the bankruptcy filing by lehman otc  which constituted an event of default under the note hedge 
because we have decided not to replace this note hedge  we are subject to potential dilution on the unhedged portion of our notes upon conversion if on the date of conversion the per share market price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of 
the terms of the notes  the rights of the holders of the notes and other counterparties to note hedges and warrants were not affected by the termination of this note hedge 
the price of our common stock could also be affected by sales of our common stock by investors who view the notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving our common stock by holders of the notes 
the hedging or arbitrage could  in turn  affect the trading price of the notes and warrants 
future issuances of common stock related to our notes  warrants  stock options  restricted stock units  and our employee stock purchase plan may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and the notes 
the conversion of some or all of our outstanding notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver common stock upon conversion of the notes 
for at least trading days during the consecutive trading days ended march   our common stock price exceeded the conversion threshold price of per share set forth for these notes 
accordingly  the notes are convertible at the holder s option through june  upon conversion of any notes  we will satisfy our obligation by delivering cash for the principal amount of the notes and shares of common stock  if any  to the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount 
any new issuance of equity securities  including the issuance of shares upon conversion of the notes or the exercise of related warrants which are not offset by our note hedges  could dilute the interests of our then existing stockholders  including holders who receive shares upon conversion of their notes  and could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock and the notes 
in addition  any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon such conversion or the exercise of warrants could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
as of april   eligible individuals under our stock option and restricted stock unit plans held options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock and a total of approximately million restricted stock units  respectively 
if all the outstanding options were exercised  the proceeds to the company would average approximately per share 
we also had million shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our stock plans with respect to equity awards that have not been granted 
the exercise of all of the outstanding options and or the vesting of all outstanding restricted shares and restricted stock units would dilute the interests of our then existing stockholders  and any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such exercise could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
in addition  we have an employee stock purchase plan espp under which employees are entitled to purchase shares of our common stock at of the fair market value at certain specified dates over a two year period 
as of april   we had approximately million shares of our common stock available for issuance under the espp 
the issuance of shares under the espp would dilute the interests of our then existing stockholders  and any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such exercise could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

table of contents we may issue equity securities in the future for a number of reasons  including to finance our operations related to business strategy including in connection with acquisitions  strategic alliances or other transactions  to increase our capital  to adjust our ratio of debt to equity  to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or options upon conversion of the notes  or for other reasons 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates  impairment of our investments could harm our financial results 
at april   we had billion in cash  cash equivalents  available for sale securities and restricted cash and investments 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  consisting principally of investments in us treasury securities  commercial paper  us government agency bonds  corporate bonds  certificates of deposit  and money market funds 
these investments are subject to general credit  liquidity  market and interest rate risks  which have been exacerbated by unusual events such as the financial and credit crisis  and bankruptcy filings in the united states which have affected various sectors of the financial markets and led to global credit and liquidity issues 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates 
currently  we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we may suffer losses if forced to sell securities that have experienced a decline in market value because of changes in interest rates 
currently  we do not use financial derivatives to hedge our interest rate exposure 
the fair value of our investments may change significantly due to events and conditions in the credit and capital markets 
any investment securities that we hold or the issues comprising such securities could be subject to review for possible downgrade 
any downgrade in these credit ratings may result in an additional decline in the estimated fair value of our investments 
changes in the various assumptions used to value these securities and any increase in the markets perceived risk associated with such investments may also result in a decline in estimated fair value 
on occasion  we make strategic investments in other companies  including private equity funds  which may decline in value and or not meet desired objectives 
the success of these investments depends on various factors over which we may have limited or no control 
as of april   we had an investment with the carrying value of million in a private equity fund 
in the event of adverse conditions in the credit and capital markets  our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some or all of our investments have experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value  requiring impairment  which could adversely impact our financial position and operating results 
a significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents balances are held overseas 
if we are not able to generate sufficient cash domestically in order to fund our us operations and strategic opportunities  and to service our debt  we may incur a significant tax liability in order to repatriate the overseas cash balances  or we may need to raise additional capital in the future 
a portion of our earnings which is generated from our international operations is held and invested by certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
these amounts are not freely available for dividend repatriation to the united states without triggering significant adverse tax consequences 
as a result  if the cash generated by our domestic operations is not sufficient to fund our domestic operations  our broader corporate initiatives such as stock repurchases  acquisitions  and other strategic opportunities  and to service our outstanding indebtedness  we may 
table of contents need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings  or we may need to obtain new credit facilities to the extent we choose not to repatriate our overseas cash 
such additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all  and any new equity financings or offerings would dilute our current stockholders ownership 
furthermore  lenders  particularly in light of the current challenges in the credit markets  may not agree to extend us new  additional or continuing credit 
if adequate funds are not available  or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be forced to repatriate our foreign cash and incur a significant tax expense or we may not be able to take advantage of strategic opportunities  develop new products  respond to competitive pressures or repay our outstanding indebtedness 
in any such case  our business  operating results or financial condition could be adversely impacted 
our synthetic leases are off balance sheet arrangements that could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results 
we have invested substantial resources in new facilities and physical infrastructure  which will increase our fixed costs 
our operating results could be harmed if our business does not grow proportionately to our increase in fixed costs 
we have various synthetic lease arrangements with bnp paribas leasing corporation as lessor bnpplc for our headquarters office buildings and land in sunnyvale  california 
these synthetic leases qualify for operating lease accounting treatment under the accounting guidance for leases and are not considered variable interest entities under applicable accounting guidance 
therefore  we do not include the properties or the associated debt on our consolidated balance sheets 
our future minimum lease payments under these synthetic leases limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business by restricting the funds available for use in addressing such changes 
if we are unable to grow our business and revenues proportionately to our increase in fixed costs  our operating results will be harmed 
if we elect not to purchase the properties at the end of the lease term  we have guaranteed a minimum residual value to bnpplc 
if the fair value of the properties declines below that guaranteed minimum residual value  our residual value guarantee would require us to pay the difference to bnpplc 
as of april   the estimated fair value of the properties was approximately million below the guaranteed minimum residual value  which we are accruing over the remaining term of the respective leases 
any further decline in the fair value of the properties could adversely impact our cash flows  financial condition and operating results 
as a result of excess capacity in our sunnyvale facilities  certain of our facilities subject to synthetic lease arrangements have been subleased or are vacant 
these subleases will expire at various times through and some are at terms that do not generate sufficient sublease income to cover the carrying costs of these facilities 
in addition  we may experience changes in our operations in the future that could result in additional excess capacity and vacant facilities 
we will continue to be responsible for all carrying costs of these facilities under operating leases until such time as we can sublease these facilities or terminate the applicable leases based on the contractual terms of the operating lease agreements  and these costs may have an adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are subject to restrictive and financial covenants in our synthetic lease arrangements 
the restrictive covenants may restrict our ability to operate our business 
our ongoing extension of credit under our synthetic lease arrangements are subject to continued compliance with financial covenants 
if we do not comply with these restrictive and financial covenants or otherwise default under the arrangements  we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts or repurchase the properties which are subject to the synthetic lease arrangements 
if we lose access to the synthetic lease arrangements  we may not be able to obtain alternative financing on acceptable terms  which could limit our operating flexibility 
the agreements governing our synthetic lease arrangements contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to operate our business  including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness  
table of contents incur indebtedness at the subsidiary level  grant liens  sell all or substantially all our assets enter into certain mergers  change our business  enter into swap agreements  enter into transactions with our affiliates  and enter into certain restrictive agreements 
as a result of these restrictive covenants  our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing  if needed  may be restricted 
we may also be prevented from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us  such as strategic acquisitions or joint ventures 
our failure to comply with the restrictive and financial covenants could result in a default under our synthetic lease arrangements  which would give the counterparties thereto the ability to exercise certain rights  including the right to accelerate the amounts owed thereunder and to terminate the arrangements 
in addition  our failure to comply with these covenants and the acceleration of amounts owed under synthetic lease arrangements could result in a default under the notes  which could permit the holders to accelerate the notes 
if all of our debt is accelerated  we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt 
we have credit exposure to our hedging counterparties 
in order to minimize volatility in earnings associated with fluctuations in the value of foreign currency relative to the us dollar  we utilize forward and option contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currencies 
as a result of entering into these hedging contracts with major financial institutions  we may be subject to counterparty nonperformance risk 
should there be a counterparty default  we could be exposed to the net losses on the hedged arrangements or be unable to recover anticipated net gains from the transactions 
funds associated with certain of our auction rate securities may not be accessible for more than months and our auction rate securities may experience further other than temporary declines in value  which would adversely affect our earnings 
auction rate securities arss held by us are securities with long term nominal maturities  which  in accordance with investment policy guidelines  had credit ratings of aaa and aaa at time of purchase 
interest rates for ars are reset through a dutch auction each month  which prior to february had provided a liquid market for these securities 
all of our arss are backed by pools of student loans guaranteed by the us department of education  and we believe the credit quality of these securities is high  based on this guarantee 
however  liquidity issues in the global credit markets resulted in the failure of auctions for certain of our ars investments  with a par value of million 
for each failed auction  the interest rate resets to a maximum rate defined for each security and the ars continues to pay interest in accordance with its terms  although the principal associated with the ars will not be accessible until there is a successful auction or such time as other markets for ars investments develop or the final maturity of the individual securities 
as of april   we determined there was a total decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately million  of which we have recorded cumulative net temporary impairment charges of million  and million was recognized as an other than temporary impairment charge 
in addition  we have classified all of our auction rate securities as long term assets in our consolidated balance sheets at april  as our ability to liquidate such securities in the next months is uncertain 
although we currently have the 
table of contents ability and intent to hold these ars investments until recovery in market value or until maturity  if current market conditions deteriorate  or the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur  we may be required to record additional impairment charges in future quarters 
we intend  and have the ability  to hold these investments until the market recovers 
we may need to undertake cost reduction initiatives and restructuring initiatives in the future 
we have previously recognized restructuring charges related to initiatives to realign our business strategies and resize our business in response to economic and market conditions  including those announced in february and december we may undertake future cost reduction initiatives and restructuring plans that may adversely impact our operations and we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our prior or any future restructurings 
our business and operations are experiencing rapid growth and organizational change 
if we fail to effectively manage such growth and change in a manner that preserves our reputation and the key aspects of our corporate culture  our business and operating results could be harmed 
due to recent organic growth and acquisitions  we have experienced  and may continue to experience  rapid growth and organizational change  which has placed  and may continue to place  significant demands on our management  operational and financial resources 
our headcount has grown from approximately  employees on april  to over  employees following the esg acquisition in may we will incur significant expenditures and the allocation of valuable management resources to assimilate our additional human resources in a manner that preserves the key aspects of our corporate culture and enables us to maintain our reputation in the marketplace 
if we do not effectively manage our growth and train  retain and manage our employee base  our corporate culture could be undermined  the quality of our products and customer service could suffer  and our reputation could be harmed  each of which could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  as our headcount increases  our costs will also increase 
our business will be harmed if our efforts to expand our organization and headcount are not accompanied by a corresponding increase in revenues 
if we are unable to establish fair value for any undelivered element of a sales arrangement  all or a portion of the revenues relating to the arrangement could be deferred to future periods 
in the course of our sales efforts  we often enter into multiple element arrangements that include software related elements consisting of non essential software and undelivered software entitlements and maintenance 
if we are required to change the pricing of our software related elements through discounting  or otherwise introduce variability in the pricing of such elements  we may be unable to maintain vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements of the arrangement  and would therefore be required to delay the recognition of all or a portion of the related arrangement 
a delay in the recognition of revenues may cause fluctuations in our financial results and may adversely affect our operating margins 
we are continually seeking ways to make our cost structure  business processes and systems more efficient  including moving activities from higher cost to lower cost owned locations  outsourcing certain business process functions and implementing new business information systems 
problems with the execution of these activities could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
we continuously seek to make our cost structure and business processes more efficient 
we are focused on increasing workforce flexibility and scalability  and improving overall competitiveness by leveraging our global capabilities  as well as external talent and skills worldwide 
for example  certain engineering activities and projects that were formerly performed in the us have been moved to lower cost international locations and we rely on partners or third party service providers for the provision of certain business process functions and activities in it  human resources and accounting 

table of contents the challenges involved with moving or outsourcing activities include executing business functions in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards  controls and procedures 
we are also subject to increased business continuity risks as we increase our reliance on outsource providers 
for example  we may no longer be able to exercise control over some aspects of the future development  support or maintenance of outsourced operations and processes  including the management and internal controls associated with those outsourced business operations and processes  which could adversely affect our business 
if we are unable to effectively utilize or integrate and interoperate with external resources or if our partners or third party service providers experience business difficulties or are unable to provide business services as anticipated  we may need to seek alternative service providers or resume providing these business processes internally  which could be costly and time consuming and have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in addition  we may not achieve the expected benefits of our business process improvement initiatives 
we are currently implementing changes to our business information systems and processes and other it initiatives 
these initiatives involve a large investment of capital and resources and significant changes to our current operating processes 
failure to properly implement one or more of these initiatives  or an interruption in service or unavailability of our systems  could result in lost business and increased costs which could negatively impact our business  results of operations and cash flows 
we are subject to risks related to the provision of employee health care benefits and recent health care reform legislation 
we use a combination of insurance and self insurance for workers compensation coverage and health care plans 
we record expenses under these plans based on estimates of the number and costs of expected claims  administrative costs and stop loss premiums 
these estimates are then adjusted each year to reflect actual costs incurred 
actual costs under these plans are subject to variability depending primarily upon participant enrollment and demographics  the actual number and costs of claims made and whether and how much the stop loss insurance we purchase covers the cost of these claims 
in the event that our cost estimates differ from actual costs  we could incur additional unplanned health care costs which could adversely impact our financial condition 
in march  comprehensive health care reform legislation under the patient protection and affordable care act hr and the health care education and affordability reconciliation act hr was passed and signed into law 
among other things  the health reform legislation includes guaranteed coverage requirements  eliminates pre existing condition exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits  restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded  and imposes new and significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits 
provisions of the health reform legislation become effective at various dates over the next several years 
the department of health and human services  the national association of insurance commissioners  the department of labor and the treasury department have yet to issue necessary enabling regulations and guidance with respect to the health care reform legislation 
due to the breadth and complexity of the health reform legislation  the lack of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance  and the phased in nature of the implementation  it is difficult to predict the overall impact of the health reform legislation on our business over the coming years 
possible adverse affects of the health reform legislation include reduced revenues  increased costs  exposure to expanded liability and requirements for us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or risk of loss of business 
in addition  our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
we depend on attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
if we are unable to attract and retain such personnel  our operating results could be materially and adversely impacted 
our continued success depends  in part  on our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified personnel 
because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products  we are particularly dependent on our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite education  background and industry experience 
competition for qualified employees  
table of contents particularly in silicon valley  can be intense 
the loss of the services of a significant number of our employees  particularly our engineers  salespeople and key managers  could be disruptive to our development efforts or business relationships and could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
a component of our strategy to hire and retain personnel consists of long term compensation in the form of equity based grants 
we face increased risk of the inability to continue to offer equity if we are unable to obtain shareholder approval in light of increased shareholder activism  heightened focus on corporate compensation practices  and increased scrutiny of the dilutive effects of such equity compensation programs 
such inability could adversely impact our ability to continue to attract and retain employees 
in addition  because of the structure of our incentive compensation plans  we may be at increased risk of losing employees and other service providers at certain points in time 
for example  the retention value of our compensation plans decreases after the payment of bonuses or the vesting of stock options  employee stock purchase rights or other equity compensation 
as a result  employees may be more likely to leave us during periods following such payments or the vesting of such rights 
the loss of services of a significant number of our key employees during a short period of time could be disruptive to our product development and sales efforts and adversely impact our business relationships and operating results 
our business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of a natural disaster  terrorist acts or other catastrophic events 
we depend on the ability of our personnel  raw materials  equipment and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the world 
any political  military  terrorism  global trade  world health or other issue that hinders this movement or restricts the import or export of materials could lead to significant business disruptions 
furthermore  any strike  economic failure or other material disruption caused by fire  floods  hurricanes  earthquakes  volcanoes  power loss  power shortages  environmental disasters  telecommunications or business information systems failures  break ins and similar events could also adversely affect our ability to conduct business 
if such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economic activity or corporate spending on information technology  or directly impact our marketing  manufacturing  financial and logistics functions  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  our headquarters are located in northern california  an area susceptible to earthquakes 
if any significant disaster were to occur  our ability to operate our business could be impaired 
undetected software errors  hardware errors  or failures found in new products may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products  which could increase our costs and reduce our revenues 
product quality problems could lead to reduced revenues  gross margins and operating results 
our products may contain undetected software errors  hardware errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
despite testing by us and by current and potential customers  errors may not be found in new products until after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  if we fail to remedy a product defect  we may experience a failure of a product line  temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market  damage to our reputation  inventory costs or product reengineering expenses  and these occurrences could have a material impact on our revenues  gross margins and operating results 
we may be subject to losses that may result from or are alleged to result from defects in our products  which could subject us to claims for damages  including consequential damages 

table of contents we are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims and protection of intellectual property rights  which could adversely affect our operating results 
we may be a party to lawsuits and other claims in the normal course of our business from time to time  including intellectual property  commercial  product liability  employment  class action  whistleblower and other litigation and claims  and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings 
litigation can be expensive  lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations 
moreover  the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict 
an unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  or financial condition 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  we may be subject to increased competition that could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
our success depends significantly upon our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures  contractual provisions  and patents to protect our proprietary rights 
we seek to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret  copyright and patent laws  which afford only limited protection 
some of our us trademarks are registered internationally as well 
we will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and with our resellers  strategic partners and customers 
we currently have multiple us and international patent applications pending and multiple us patents issued 
the pending applications may not be approved  and our existing and future patents may be challenged 
if such challenges are brought  the patents may be invalidated 
we may not be able to develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable  and patents issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties 
further  the patents of others may materially and adversely affect our ability to do business 
in addition  a failure to obtain and defend our trademark registrations may impede our marketing and branding efforts and competitive position 
litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology 
any such litigation may be time consuming and costly 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate or our competitors may independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products  or design around patents issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours 
we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims 
we may  from time to time  receive claims that we are infringing third parties intellectual property rights 
third parties may in the future  claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products  patents  trademarks or other proprietary rights 
we expect that companies in the network storage and data management market will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays  require us to redesign our products or enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
our business could be materially adversely affected by changes in regulations or standards regarding energy efficiency of our products and climate change issues 
we continually seek ways to increase the energy efficiency of our products 
recent analyses have estimated the amount of global carbon emissions that are due to information technology products 
as a result  governmental and non governmental organizations have turned their attention to development of regulations and standards to drive technological improvements and reduce such amount of carbon emissions 
there is a risk that the development of these standards will not fully address the complexity of the technology developed by the it 
table of contents industry or will favor certain technological approaches 
depending on the regulations or standards that are ultimately adopted  compliance could adversely affect our business  financial condition or operating results 
climate change issues  energy usage and emissions controls may result in new environmental legislation and regulations  at any or all of the international  federal and state levels  that may unfavorably impact us  our suppliers  and our customers in how we conduct our business including the design  development  and manufacturing of our products 
this could cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations  as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers  suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us 
these costs may adversely impact our operations and financial condition 
our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted as a consequence of regulations or business trends such as decreased demand for storage products that produce significant greenhouse gases  increased demand for storage products that produce lower emissions and are more energy efficient  and increased competition to develop such products  and reputational risk based on negative public perception of publicly reported data on our greenhouse gas emissions 
our business is subject to increasingly complex corporate governance  public disclosure  accounting and tax requirements that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance 
because our common stock is publicly traded  we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal  state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded 
these entities  including the public company accounting oversight board  the sec  and nasdaq  have implemented requirements and regulations and continue developing additional regulations and requirements in response to corporate scandals and laws enacted by congress  most notably the sarbanes oxley act of our efforts to comply with these regulations have resulted in  and are likely to continue resulting in  increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
we have completed our evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended april  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of although our assessment  testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that  as of april   our internal controls over financial reporting were effective  we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods 
if our internal controls are ineffective in future periods  our business and reputation could be harmed 
we may incur additional expenses and commitment of management s time in connection with further evaluations  both of which could materially increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our operating results 
on july   the president signed into law the dodd frank act 
many aspects of the dodd frank act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years  making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us 
however  as we continue to implement changes in response to this new law and its associated regulations  we expect to incur additional operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
because new and modified laws  regulations  and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies 
this evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices 

table of contents if a data center or other third party who relies on our products experiences a disruption in service or a loss of data  such disruption or loss could be attributed to the quality of our products  thereby causing financial or reputational harm to our business 
third party vendors  including data centers  saas  cloud computing and internet infrastructure and bandwidth providers rely on our products for their data storage needs 
we exercise little control over how these third party vendors use or maintain our products  and in some cases improper usage or maintenance could impair the performance of our products 
a disruption in the services provided by these third party vendors  or the loss of data stored by such vendors  could result in financial or reputational harm to our business to the extent that such disruption or loss is caused by  or perceived by our customers to have been caused by  defects in our products 
moreover  the risk of reputational harm may be magnified and or distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the internet  including through news articles  blogs  chat rooms  and social media sites 
security and privacy breaches may expose us to liability  and our reputation and business could suffer 
we obtain and store sensitive data related to our employees  customers and partners  including intellectual property  books of record and personally identifiable information 
it is critical to our business strategy that our infrastructure remains secure and is perceived by our employees  customers and partners to be secure 
if our security measures are breached as a result of technical problems  third party actions  employee error  or malfeasance  our reputation could be damaged and our business could suffer 
changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 
a change in accounting standards or practices and varying interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements  such as the changes to revenue recognition standards that we recently adopted  the increased use of fair value measures  additional proposed changes to revenue recognition  lease accounting  financial instruments and other accounting standards  and the potential requirement that us registrants prepare financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs  could have a significant effect on our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
implementation of accounting regulations and related interpretations and policies  particularly those related to revenue recognition  could cause us to defer recognition of revenue or recognize lower revenue  which may affect our results of operations
