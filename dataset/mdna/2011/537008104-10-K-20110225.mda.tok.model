the guidance also revises earlier guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity  requires a new approach for determining who should consolidate a variable interest entity  changes when it is necessary to reassess who should consolidate a variable interest entity  and requires enhanced disclosures related to an enterprise s involvement in variable interest entities 
the guidance is effective for the first annual reporting period that begins after november  the company adopted the new accounting guidance on january   which did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that amends earlier guidance addressing the accounting for contractual arrangements in which an entity provides multiple products or services deliverables to a customer 
the amendments address the unit of accounting for arrangements involving multiple deliverables and how arrangement consideration should be allocated to the separate units of accounting  when applicable  by establishing a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific nor third party evidence is available 
the amendments also require that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  the company adopted the new accounting guidance on january   which did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that amends earlier guidance for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements 
tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality are no longer within the scope of guidance for recognizing revenue from the sale of software  but would be accounted for in accordance with other authoritative guidance 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   with earlier application permitted 
the company does not believe that the adoption of this accounting guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued additional guidance to improve fair value disclosures and increase the transparency in financial reporting 
these enhancements include a reporting entity should disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers  and in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs  a reporting entity should present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements 
this new guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  the company adopted the new accounting guidance on january   which did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in february  the sec issued a statement that reaffirms its support for the potential use of ifrs in the preparation of financial statements by us registrants 
it announced a work plan by which it is expected to make a determination in whether or not it will mandate the conversion to ifrs 
as of october  the sec continues to anticipate making the determination in of whether  when  and how to incorporate ifrs into the us domestic financial reporting system 
the company is currently assessing the potential impact of ifrs on its consolidated financial statements and will continue to review progress of the work plan 
in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance related to disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
the guidance specified that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings

in december  the fasb issued an authoritative guidance describing when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
the amendments in this guidance modify step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that impairment may exist 
the qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance and examples  which require that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
for public entities  the amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is not permitted 
the company expects to adopt this new guidance effective the beginning of fiscal year  and does not expect it to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates certain of the accounting policies as discussed below require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate estimates and assumptions for calculating amounts to record in the financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions  impacting the reported results of operations and financial position 
significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
certain accounting policies  however  are considered to be critical in that they are most important to the depiction of the company s financial condition and results of operations and their application requires management s subjective judgment in making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company believes the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating its reported financial results  as they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of its board of directors 
net sales revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period in which the sales process is complete 
this generally occurs when products are shipped fob origin to the customer in accordance with the terms of the sale  the risk of loss has been transferred  collectability is reasonably assured and the pricing is fixed and determinable 
at the end of each period  for those shipments where title to the products and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership do not transfer until the product has been received by the customer  the company adjusts revenues and cost of sales for the delay between the time that the products are shipped and when they are received by the customer 
the company s distribution channels are primarily through direct sales and independent third party distributors 
revenue and billing the company accepts orders from customers based on long term purchasing contracts and written sales agreements 
contract pricing and selling agreement terms are based on market factors  costs and competition 
pricing normally is negotiated as an adjustment premium or discount from the company s published price lists 
the customer is invoiced when the company s products are shipped to them in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement 
returns and credits some of the terms of the company s sales agreements and normal business conditions provide customers distributors the ability to receive price adjustments on products previously shipped and invoiced 
this practice is common in the industry and is referred to as a ship and debit program 
this program allows the distributor to debit the company for the difference between the distributors contracted price and a lower price for specific transactions 
under certain circumstances usually in a competitive situation or large volume opportunity  a distributor will request authorization to reduce its price to its buyer 
if the company approves such a reduction  the distributor is authorized to debit its account for the difference between the contracted price and the lower approved price 
the company establishes reserves for this program based on historic activity and actual authorizations for the debit and recognizes these debits as a reduction of revenue 
the company has a return to stock policy whereby a customer with previous authorization from littelfuse management can return previously purchased goods for full or partial credit 
the company establishes an estimated allowance for these returns based on historic activity 
sales revenue and cost of sales are reduced to anticipate estimated returns 
the company properly meets all of the criteria for recognizing revenue when the right of return exists 
specifically  the company meets those requirements because the company s selling price is fixed or determinable at the date of the sale 
the company has policies and procedures to accept only credit worthy customers with the ability to pay the company 
the company s customers are obligated to pay the company under the contract and the obligation is not contingent on the resale of the product 
all ship and debit and returns to stock require specific circumstances and authorization 
the risk ownership transfers to the company s customers upon shipment and is not changed in the event of theft  physical destruction or damage of the product 
the company bills at the ship date and establishes a reserve to reduce revenue from the in transit time until the product is delivered for fob destination sales 
the company s customers acquiring the product for resale have economic substance apart from that provided by littelfuse 
all distributors are independent of the company 
the company does not have any obligations for future performance to bring about resale of the product by its customers 
the company can reasonably estimate the amount of future returns 
volume rebates the company offers incentives to certain customers to achieve specific quarterly or annual sales targets 
if customers achieve their sales targets  they are entitled to rebates 
the company estimates the future cost of these rebates and recognizes this estimated cost as a reduction to revenue as products are sold 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the collectability of its trade receivables based on a combination of factors 
the company regularly analyzes its significant customer accounts and  when the company becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible 
the company also records allowances for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due  the financial health of the customer  macroeconomic considerations and past experience 
historically  the allowance for doubtful accounts has been adequate to cover bad debts 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  the estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 
inventory the company performs regular detailed assessments of inventory  which include a review of  among other factors  demand requirements  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  shelf life and quality issues 
based on the analysis  the company records adjustments to inventory for excess quantities  obsolescence or impairment when appropriate to reflect inventory at net realizable value 
historically  inventory reserves have been adequate to reflect inventory at net realizable values 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company annually tests goodwill for impairment on the first day of its fiscal fourth quarter or at an interim date if there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates the asset may be impaired 
the company has four reporting units for goodwill testing purposes 
management determines the fair value of each of its reporting units by using a discounted cash flow model which includes forecasted five year income statement and working capital projections  a market based weighted average cost of capital and terminal values after five years to estimate market value 
in addition  the company compares its derived enterprise value on a consolidated basis to the company s market capitalization as of its test date to ensure its derived value approximates the market value of the company when taken as a whole 
as of the most recent annual test conducted on october   the company concluded the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying value of invested capital and therefore  no goodwill impairment existed 
specifically  the company noted that its headroom  defined as the excess of fair value over the carrying value of invested capital  was   and for its electronics  automotive  base electrical  and protection relay and custom products reporting units  respectively  at october  certain key assumptions used in the annual test included a discount rate of and a long term growth rate of for all four reporting units 
in addition  the company performed a sensitivity test at october  that showed a basis point increase in its discount rate or a basis point decrease in the long term growth rate for each reporting unit would not have changed the company s conclusion that no goodwill impairment existed at october  the company will continue to perform a goodwill impairment test as required on an annual basis and on an interim basis  if certain conditions exist 
factors the company considers important  which could result in changes to its estimates  include underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results and declines in acquisitions and trading multiples 
due to the diverse end user base and non discretionary product demand  the company does not believe its future operating results will vary significantly relative to its historical and projected future operating results 
long lived assets the company evaluates long lived asset groups on an ongoing basis 
long lived asset groups are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the related asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
if it is determined to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the company s estimates of future cash flows from such assets could be impacted if it underperforms relative to historical or projected future operating results 
the company recorded asset impairment charges of million  million and million for the fiscal years ended  and respectively 
further information regarding asset impairments is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
environmental liabilities environmental liabilities are accrued based on estimates of the probability of potential future environmental exposure 
expenses related to on going maintenance of environmental sites are expensed as incurred 
if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed the company s recorded liability for such claims  it would record additional charges as other expense during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 
pension and supplemental executive retirement plan littelfuse has a number of company sponsored defined benefit plans primarily in north america  europe and the asia pacific region 
the company recognizes the full unfunded status of the plan on the balance sheet 
actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs and credits are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
accounting for pensions requires estimating the future benefit cost and recognizing the cost over the employee s expected period of employment with the company 
certain assumptions are required in the calculation of pension costs and obligations 
these assumptions include the discount rate  salary scales and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the discount rate is intended to represent the rate at which pension benefit obligations could be settled by purchase of an annuity contract 
these assumptions are subject to change based on stock and bond market returns and other economic factors 
actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect its recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods 
while the company believes that its assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and its actual experience  significant differences in results or significant changes in the company s assumptions may materially affect its pension obligations and related future expense 
further information regarding these plans is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense is recorded for stock option grants  restricted stock and performance based restricted stock awards based upon the fair values of the awards 
the fair value of stock option awards is estimated at the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model  which includes assumptions for volatility  expected term  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on littelfuse stock  historical volatility of littelfuse stock and other factors 
historical data is used to estimate employee termination experience and the expected term of the options 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant
