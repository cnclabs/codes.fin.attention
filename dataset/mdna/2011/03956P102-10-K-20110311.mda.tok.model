item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in the understanding of our consolidated financial position and our results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes in item of this report 
overview archipelago learning is a leading subscription based  saas provider of education products 
we provide standards based instruction  practice  assessments and productivity tools that support educator s efforts to reach students in innovative ways and enhance the performance of students via proprietary web based platforms 
as of december   our products were utilized by over million students in nearly  schools in all states  washington dc  canada  and the united kingdom 
we were founded in in  we launched our first study island products in two states 
by  we developed study island products for all states  in the subject areas of reading  writing  mathematics  social studies and science and have grown from serving schools in with study island to  schools as of december  with our four product lines  study island  educationcity  northstar learning and reading eggs 
study island helps students in k master grade level academic standards in a fun and engaging manner 
we entered the postsecondary educational market with the launch of northstar learning in april  which uses the same web based platform as our study island products to provide various instruction  assessment and exam preparation content 
in november  we sold our teacherweb business to edline holdings  inc edline  a private educational technology company offering products and services similar to teacherweb 
we had previously made an investment in edline in august see notes and in our consolidated financial statements 
in june  we entered the uk market with the acquisition of educationcity  a leading developer and publisher of educationcity 
com  an online pre k educational content and assessment program for schools in the united kingdom and united states 
similar to study island  educationcity maps to standards  combines rigorous content and interactive animations  fun games  and motivational rewards to drive academic success in a fun and engaging manner 
unlike study island  educationcity core classroom and individualized instruction is geared toward the initial teaching phases of academic content 
educationcity helps students learn basic skills and concepts while study island helps assess  reinforce and master this knowledge 
when used in conjunction with one another  educationcity and study island provide a powerful comprehensive teaching and reinforcement solution to enhance student learning and teacher performance 
pursuant to the acquisition of educationcity  we operate as three operating segments  study island  educationcity limited a uk company and educationcity inc an illinois company 
we aggregate the three operating segments into one reportable segment based on the similar nature of the products  content and technical production processes  types of customers  methods used to distribute the products  and similar rates of profitability 
see note in our consolidated financial statements for further information on segments and geographic area disclosures 
in august  we began selling reading eggs  an online product focusing on teaching young children to read 
reading eggs is sold under a distribution agreement with blake publishing  which requires us to pay a royalty to blake publishing for every sale 
beginning in  the company will be required to pay a minimum royalty each year of the agreement 
in the united states  seasonal trends associated with school budget years and state testing calendars also affect the timing of our sales of subscriptions to new and existing customers 
as a result  most new subscriptions and renewals occur in the third quarter because teachers and school administrators typically make purchases for the new academic year at the beginning of their district s fiscal year  which is usually july in the united kingdom  seasonal trends associated with school budget years affect the timing of our sales of subscriptions to new and existing customers 
as a result  there is a peak in new subscriptions and renewals late in the first quarter because teachers and school administrators often make purchases at the end of their fiscal year  which is usually april the 
table of contents fourth quarter is also typically strong  with some customers working to calendar year budget periods  while third quarter is weakest due to the uk vacation period 
subscriptions to our study island and educationcity products generate the vast majority of our revenue 
our products are sold as subscriptions through purchase orders 
the average subscription period for our products is months  and we occasionally sell multi year subscriptions 
we rely significantly on our ability to secure renewals for subscriptions to our products as well as sales to new customers 
we generally contact schools several months in advance of the expiration of their subscription  to attempt to secure renewal subscriptions 
if a school does not renew its subscription within six months after its expiration  we categorize it as a lost school  and if a school subsequently purchases a subscription after this renewal period  we consider it to be a new subscription 
events in january  we released study island version  or v  which added additional functionality to our study island online platform  which includes a custom assessment builder  lesson plans and lessons  video content  special needs support including expanded text to speech functionality  a writing utility  digital locker  new and more sophisticated games  and embedded professional development for teachers 
between august and december  we released study island version  or v  which was well received by customers  with all features getting very favorable feedback 
the flagship feature of v is a completely new high school website  which has a more mature look and feel 
in conjunction with the enhanced game interface and the release of age appropriate games for teen students  we have significantly upgraded our high school product offering 
other notable enhancements include a fully customizable teacher portal  a rich data laden weekly principal report  and interactive flashcard capabilities for students and teachers 
we published new study island products during the year ended december   with a focus on expanding our high school product line across all major subject areas in our largest states  including publishing new sat  act and advanced placement test preparation products and filling in grade level and subject area holes in our elementary and middle school line up for mid size and small states 
we also developed a new set of products based on the common core standards for grades through  as well as high school  and we began rolling out these new products to the states who have adopted them 
on june   we acquired educationcity through the purchase of of the equity of educationcity for a purchase price of i million in cash  ii  shares of common stock of the company  and iii million in additional deferred cash consideration 
the company also paid the sellers million for a post closing working capital adjustment 
the acquisition was financed with cash on hand and the proceeds of a new million supplemental term loan and million in revolving loan commitments 
revenues of million and net losses of million arising from educationcity are included in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  in august  we began selling reading eggs  an online product focusing on teaching young children to read 
reading eggs is sold under a distribution agreement with blake publishing  which requires us to pay a royalty to blake publishing for every sale 
beginning in  the company will be required to pay a minimum royalty each year of the agreement 
in september  we entered into an exclusive royalty agreement with a third party to expand our educationcity products into china 
the expansion will be marketed by the third party provider to obtain subscribers to the educationcity product in china 
educationcity will receive a base royalty plus an additional royalty for each student per year of access to the localized site 
the term of the agreement is for three years  with optional renewal terms 
key legislative developments that may impact our business and operations in the united states  the increased focus on higher academic standards and assessments as a means to measure educator accountability is largely reflected in legislative efforts such as no child left behind  the common name for the reauthorization of the elementary and secondary education act  or esea 
esea required all states to 
table of contents have academic standards in place for k students in reading  math and science  and to assess student achievement annually with end of school year assessments 
the esea legislation was initially scheduled for reauthorization in october  but has been continually extended 
in  the federal administration recommended significant changes to esea 
while many politicians believe that the nation s primary education law needs to be revised  we believe this will not happen until the second half of at the earliest 
while uncertainty continues to surround the substance and timing of esea reauthorization  we believe that higher standards  more rigorous assessments and accountability will remain key components of the revised esea 
in addition  most of our us customers are public schools and school districts that have to comply with state educational standards 
as a result  our sales depend on the availability of public funds  which have become more limited as many states or districts face budget cuts due to decreases in their tax bases and rates 
state and federal educational funding is primarily funded through income taxes  and local educational funding is primarily funded through property taxes 
as a result of the ongoing recession  income tax revenue for the and tax years has decreased  which has put pressure on state and federal budgets 
however  according to the nelson a 
rockefeller institute of government  state tax revenues grew by in the third quarter of  representing the third consecutive quarter that states reported growth in collections on a year over year basis 
despite three consecutive quarters of growth  state tax revenues were still lower in the third quarter of than in the same quarter two years earlier 
also of note  the us federal budget was passed by congress during the fourth quarter of  which is the official start date of the fiscal year 
the budget provides a billion increase in funding for k education programs authorized in esea  including million for school turnaround grants 
president obama s budget proposal includes a increase in k related program spending  including key funding sources that districts and schools use to purchase instructional materials 
however  the president s budget plan faces an uncertain future as congress has proposed reducing fiscal spending by billion  including billion in education funds 
in  the us department of education implemented its highly publicized race to the top rttt competition whereby winning states were awarded funds totaling billion in aggregate for agreeing to implement bold educational reforms 
states receiving these rttt funds are expected to implement educational reforms over the next several years 
a requirement for rttt applicants is to signal their intent to officially adopt the common core standards for k in reading and mathematics  released in june as of december   states  the district of columbia  american samoa islands  guam  northern mariana islands  puerto rico and the us virgin islands had officially adopted the new standards  although adoption of the standards does not bring immediate change in the classroom 
we believe that implementation of the common core standards will be a long term process  as states rethink their teacher training  curriculum  instructional materials and testing 
we continue to believe that common core standards implementation will evolve in different ways across the adopting states and will raise the overall rigor of curriculum and assessments  but we increasingly believe that the federal government will not mandate national standards and assessments 
study island products are specifically built from the varying academic and assessment standards in all states  which we believe differentiates them from the products offered by our competitors 
however  given the uncertainty regarding the common core standards movement  we have invested both in development of new common core products for the adopting states including the district of columbia as well as continued development of new products and enhancements for existing state standards 
while the federal legislative efforts and budgetary challenges in schools could present challenges to our future sales  we believe that we are positioned to perform well in the current environment for various reasons we are well aligned with educational reform policies and initiatives  including the common core standards  we make innovation easy as schools shift from print based solutions to online digital content  instruction  assessment and data reporting  we have a proven model and track record for engaging and improving learning outcomes  we are affordable compared to other educational product offerings and we still have relatively low overall school penetration with room for growth 

table of contents with the acquisition of educationcity  the uk market and industry trends are also of importance to our business 
while the global economic recession has impacted the united kingdom  the new government under british prime minister  david cameron  has attempted to protect education  with the department for education budget rising from billion to billion over the next four years 
this is the money that goes directly to schools 
in addition  teachers will be given greater freedom from bureaucratic burdens to use their professional judgment to meet the needs of their pupils 
head teachers will have increased flexibility over their budgets  including through simpler  fairer and more transparent funding streams

we generate revenue from customer subscriptions to standards based instruction  practice  assessments and productivity tools  training fees for onsite or online training sessions that are primarily provided to new customers  and individual buys  which are individual purchases for access to a product one subject in a specific state for a specific grade level 
customer subscriptions provide the vast majority of our revenue 
our subscription purchases are generally evidenced by a purchase order or other evidence of an arrangement 
we recognize an invoiced sale in the period in which the purchase order or other evidence of an arrangement is received and the invoice is issued  which may be at a different time than the commencement of the subscription 
revenue for invoiced sales is deferred and recognized ratably over the subscription term beginning on the commencement date of the applicable subscription 
factors affecting our revenue include i the number of schools  classes or students purchasing our products  ii the term of the subscriptions  iii subscription renewals  iv the number of states or geographies in which we offer products  v the number of products we offer in a state or in a geographic region  vi the complexity and comprehensiveness of applicable standards  which impacts pricing  vii the effectiveness of our regional field based and inside sales teams  viii recognition of revenue in any period from deferred revenue from subscriptions purchased or renewed during the current and prior periods  ix federal  state and local educational funding levels  and x discretionary purchasing funds available to our customers 
the timing of sales to new and existing customers is generally affected by seasonal trends associated with school budget years and state testing calendars 
as a result  most new subscriptions and renewals occur in the third quarter because teachers and school administrators typically make purchases for the new academic year at the beginning of their district s fiscal year  which is usually july our fourth quarter has historically produced the second highest level of new subscriptions and renewals  followed by our second and first quarters 
because revenue from customer subscriptions is deferred over the course of the subscription period and our customers pay for their 
table of contents subscriptions at the beginning of the subscription period  this seasonality does not cause our revenue to fluctuate significantly  but does impact our cash flow 
revenue for the year ended december  was million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to revenue of million for the year ended december  of this increase  million was due to the acquisition of educationcity 
in addition  subscription and training revenue is recognized over the term of the subscription  which averages months 
consequently  our revenue in any period is impacted by invoiced sales from subscriptions purchased or renewed during the current and prior periods 
pricing for study island subscriptions is based on a variety of factors 
study island subscriptions are priced on a fixed price per class or a variable price per school based on the number of students per grade using the products 
in addition  subscriptions are priced on a per subject matter basis with discounts given if all of the subjects for a given grade are purchased 
subscription prices also vary by state based on the number  complexity and comprehensiveness of the applicable standards 
our study island products are specifically built from the varying assessment standards in all states  which we believe differentiates us from our competitors 
for educationcity  schools and or districts local authorities pay a fixed annual subscription fee for each subject 
we increased our standard pricing for study island products in january we do not believe  however  that this pricing increase is meaningful to changes in our revenue 
our pricing structure is complex  using a set of standard prices  but offering discretionary discounts of different amounts for a wide range of circumstances with our clients 
additionally  considering that we recognize revenue from customer subscriptions ratably over the subscription periods which average months  price increases have a delayed impact on revenue within a single period presented in our financial statements 
the following table sets forth information regarding our invoiced sales as well as other metrics that impact our revenue for the years ended december dollars in thousands invoiced sales new customers existing customers other sales total royalties on invoiced sales change in deferred revenue revenue change in deferred revenue in excludes the amount of deferred revenue assumed with the acquisition of educationcity and includes foreign exchange fluctuation impacts other metrics us schools using our products uk schools using our products us products available uk products available states we present invoiced sales data to provide a supplemental measure of our operating performance 
we believe the various invoiced sales metrics enable investors to evaluate our sales performance in isolation and on a consistent basis without the effects of revenue deferral and revenue recognition from sales in prior periods 
in addition  invoiced sales to new customers and existing customers and invoiced other sales provide investors with important information regarding the source of orders for our products and services and our sales performance in a particular period 
invoiced sales are not recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  and should not be used an as indicator of  or an alternative to  revenue and deferred revenue 
invoiced sales metrics have significant limitations as analytical tools because they do not take into account the requirement to 
table of contents provide the applicable product or service over the subscription period and they do not match the recognition of revenue with the associated cost of revenue 
reconciliation is provided in the table above between invoiced sales and revenue  the closest gaap measure to invoiced sales 
as a part of the acquisition of educationcity  we acquired deferred revenue  representing million in amounts paid by customers for subscriptions acquired prior to the acquisition 
as a part of purchase accounting for the acquisition of educationcity  we recorded a million adjustment to reduce this deferred revenue to the fair value of million 
the impact of this purchase accounting adjustment reduced our revenues by million for the year ended december  as of december   approximately  schools used our us products and approximately  schools used our us products 
a school is considered to be using our products if it has an active subscription for any or all of the products available to it 
the number of schools using our products will increase for sales to new schools and will decrease if schools do not renew their subscriptions 
we generally contact schools several months in advance of the expiration of their subscription to attempt to secure renewal subscriptions 
if a school does not renew its subscription within six months after its expiration  we categorize it as a lost school 
if the school subsequently purchases a subscription to our products after this renewal period  we consider it to be a new subscription 
for the twelve months ended june   we had a renewal rate of  which reflects the percentage of schools that subscribed for our products throughout those twelve months and then subscribed for our products again in the next period  within six months of their subscription end date

our provision for income tax is comprised of federal  state and local taxes based on our income in the appropriate jurisdictions

upon the corporate reorganization  we recorded million of tax provision to recognize a net deferred tax liability to our balance sheet 
teacherweb  our discontinued operation  was treated as a taxable corporation for federal income tax purposes 
we are also subject to certain franchise taxes and we record these expenses in our provision for income tax 
liquidity and capital resources our primary cash requirements include the payment of our operating expense  interest and principal payments on our debt  and capital expenditures 
we do not anticipate paying any dividends on our capital stock for the foreseeable future 
we may also incur unexpected costs and operating expenses related to any unforeseen disruptions to our servers  the loss of key personnel or changes in the credit markets and interest rates  which could increase our immediate cash requirements or otherwise impact our liquidity 
we finance our operations primarily through cash flows from operations 
several factors outside of our control may impact our cash flows 
for example  we believe that there is substantial uncertainty around the substance and timing of the esea reauthorization 
the terms of its extension  reauthorization or new legislation that would replace it may materially impact the demand for our products 
if new legislation lessens the importance of state by state testing and assessments  demand for our products may materially decrease  or if competitors can more easily enter 
table of contents our markets because of the establishment of national education standards  we may experience lower cash flows  both of which would affect our liquidity 
in addition  if state and local budget cuts in education continue  our public school and school district customers may lack funding to buy our products which may result in fewer sales or require us to lower prices for our products  either of which would have a negative impact on our cash flows 
our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalent balances as well as availability under our revolving credit facility 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million of availability under our revolving credit facility 
our total indebtedness was million at december   including our additional term loan of million borrowed in connection with the acquisition of educationcity and our amended credit agreement 
we believe that our consistent cash flows and our million availability under our revolving credit facility combined with our low capital expenditure costs will provide us with sufficient capital to continue to grow our business 
there can be no assurance  however  that cash resources will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations and other capital requirements  including capital expenditures and acquisitions  will depend upon our future results of operations and our ability to obtain additional debt or equity capital and our ability to stay in compliance with our financial covenants  which  in turn  will be subject to general economic  financial  business  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other conditions  many of which are beyond our control 
we may also need to obtain additional funds to finance acquisitions  which may be in the form of additional debt or equity 
although we believe we have sufficient liquidity under our revolving credit facility  as discussed above  under extreme market conditions there can be no assurance that such funds would be available or sufficient  and in such a case  we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
cash flows our net consolidated cash flows consist of the following  for the years ended december in thousands provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december  this million increase was primarily due to increased cash generated from our invoiced sales which was partially offset by payments for transaction costs related to the acquisition of educationcity of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december  this million increase was primarily due to an increase in net income adjusted for non cash items of million and an increase in cash flow adjustments from working capital of million

off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expense  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to long lived intangible and tangible assets  goodwill and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
the accounting policies we believe to be most critical to understanding our results of operations and financial condition and that require complex and subjective management judgments are discussed below 
revenue recognition we generate revenue from customer subscriptions to standards based instruction  practice  assessments and productivity tools  training fees  for onsite or online training sessions that are primarily provided to new study island and educationcity customers  and individual buys  which are individual purchases for access to our products 
revenue is recognized when all of the following conditions are satisfied there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the customer has access to full use of the product  the collection of the fees is reasonably assured  and the amount of the fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
our arrangements do not contain general rights of return 
our subscription fees are typically billed prior to the commencement of the subscription term 
we defer the total amount of the sale of subscriptions  training  and support as unearned revenue when the customer is invoiced and recognize the revenue on a straight line basis over the subscription period  beginning on the commencement date of each subscription 
the average subscription term is months for our products 
we occasionally sell multi year subscriptions 
additionally  promotional incentives  such as complimentary months of service  are offered periodically to new customers  resulting in a subscription term longer than one year 
all of our subscriptions are sold on a non cancelable basis 
as a result  substantially all of the revenue that we recognize in any period represents deferred revenue from subscriptions purchased or renewed during current and previous periods 
from time to time  we may enhance or upgrade our products 
because we provide our products on a single web based platform  all of our customers generally benefit from new features and functionality released during the subscription term at no additional cost 
training sessions are offered to our customers in conjunction with the subscriptions to train the customers on implementing  using  and administering our programs 
training revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription term for the related subscription 
customer support is provided to customers following the sale at no additional charge and at a minimal personnel cost per call 
business combinations we account for business combinations under the purchase method of accounting 
the total cost of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying net assets  based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
determining the nature of identifiable intangible assets and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires 
table of contents management s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the value assigned to a specific asset or liability  and the period over which an asset is depreciated or amortized can impact future earnings 
some of the more significant estimates made in business combinations relate to the values assigned to identifiable intangible assets  such as customer relationships  content and trade names  and the period over which these assets are amortized 
goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of net assets acquired 
goodwill is assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually and any time an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the goodwill below its carrying value 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step test 
the first step is a comparison of each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered potentially impaired and we must complete the second step of the impairment test 
the amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
specifically  we would allocate the fair value to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including internally developed intangible assets with a zero carrying value  in a hypothetical analysis that would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference 
we perform our impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year 
as of december   we had three reporting units study island  educationcity us and educationcity us in june  we acquired educationcity  and recorded the purchase price and related goodwill at the estimated fair value at that time 
therefore  for the purposes of our annual goodwill impairment test  we only included the study island reporting unit 
at december   the fair value of goodwill in the study island reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying value 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test  we applied a hypothetical decrease to the fair value of the study island reporting unit 
had the estimated fair value of the study island reporting unit been hypothetically lower by as of december   the fair value of goodwill would have still significantly exceeded the carrying value 
the fair values of our reporting units performed for our testing in  and relied on estimates including the following factors data from actual open marketplace transactions 
we may utilize such information  if available  where those transactions may involve assets or equity  to assist management in evaluating goodwill impairment 
anticipated future cash flows and terminal value for each reporting unit 
the income approach to determining the fair value relies on the timing and estimates of future cash flows  including an estimate of terminal value 
the projections use management s estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in revenue  customer attrition and estimates of any expected changes in operating margins 
we have utilized an income growth rate for our estimates  which we believe to be reasonable based on historical growth and market and industry conditions 
our projections of future cash flows are subject to change as actual results are achieved that differ from those anticipated 
because management frequently updates its projections  we would expect to identify on a timely basis any significant differences between actual results and recent estimates 
we are not expecting actual results to vary significantly from estimates 
selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the income approach requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate  which is based on a weighted average cost of capital analysis 
the discount rate is affected by changes in short term interest rates and long term yield as well as variances in the typical capital structure of marketplace participants 
for our impairment testing in the fourth quarter of  we utilized a weighted average cost of capital which was developed using a combination of a risk free rate  an equity premium  and a risk factor 
for the risk free rate  we utilized the year us government bond rate 
the equity premium was developed based on a study of historical security market returns  adjusted for the size of our reporting entities 
the risk factor was based on our product lines  potential changes in market demand  current market conditions and other potentially relevant factors 
given the current volatile general economic conditions  it is possible that the discount rate will fluctuate in the near term 

table of contents no impairment loss was identified during the impairment testing performed in  or based upon the results of our impairment testing and events that have occurred subsequently  we do not believe either of our reporting units to be at risk of failing step one of impairment testing for the foreseeable future 
indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually at the same time as the goodwill impairment testing by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset to its book value 
no impairment has been identified in our indefinite lived intangible assets in  or amortizable intangible assets and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if impairment indicators exist  an assessment of undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by such assets is made 
if the results of the analysis indicate impairment  the assets are adjusted to fair market value 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
no impairment loss has been identified in our intangible or long lived assets in  or stock based compensation expense prior to the corporate reorganization  archipelago learning holdings  llc issued class b and class c shares to employees as part of their compensation 
the holders of such shares were entitled to receive distributions  including distributions in connection with the liquidation  dissolution or winding up of archipelago learning holdings  llc  when and as determined by its board of managers  in accordance with  and subject to the terms of  the limited liability company agreement of archipelago learning holdings  llc 
the archipelago learning holdings  llc limited liability company agreement sets forth the priority and order in which the holders of the class b and class c shares were entitled to receive distributions commonly referred to as a waterfall  based on amounts of invested capital and preferred returns on invested capital 
in addition  the receipt of distributions in respect of such shares was subject to certain additional conditions  including vesting and distribution thresholds ie  various threshold amounts of aggregate distributions on senior classes ie  the class a and class a shares before distributions are made on the class b and class c shares 
each class b share vested on each anniversary  subject to continued employment or service 
the class c shares were subject to performance hurdles  pursuant to which holders of class c shares are entitled to distributions only after holders of class a and class a shares receive certain multiples of cash based returns on their respective class a and class a shares  subject to such class c shareholders continued employment or service 
the distribution thresholds were higher for each of the and grants 
as a result of the waterfall and the distribution thresholds  a liquidity event at the grant date fair value would yield no proceeds to the holders of the class b and class c shares 
at the corporate reorganization  the class b and class c shares were exchanged for shares of common stock and restricted common stock in archipelago learning  inc the number of common shares was determined using a calculation of the liquidation value  as defined in the archipelago learning holdings  llc agreement  of the class b and class c shares on the date of the corporate reorganization and the initial public offering price of the common stock 
holders of class b shares received common stock for their vested shares and restricted common stock for their unvested shares  with the same vesting schedule on the restricted stock as they had for their unvested shares 
class c shares held by our chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief technology officer and founders were exchanged for restricted common stock  which vests based on conditions  including the return of capital by providence equity partners 
the remaining class c holders received common stock 
the exchange resulted in no additional compensation expense  as the fair value of the common stock and restricted common stock received did not exceed the fair value of the class b and class c shares exchanged on the date of the corporate reorganization 
on november   our board of directors and shareholders approved the omnibus incentive plan  which authorizes the board to grant common stock  restricted common stock and options to purchase common stock to our employees  directors or consultants  as compensation for services to be rendered 

table of contents we recognize compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of the awards 
compensation expense for grants of common stock is recognized at the time of grant 
compensation expense for restricted common stock and stock options is recognized over the vesting period of the award 
compensation expense for the class b shares was recognized ratably over five years and compensation expense for the class c shares was recognized at the time of issuance 
compensation expense for the restricted common stock exchanged for unvested class b shares is recognized over the remaining vesting period 
the grant date fair value of common and restricted common stock is determined using the closing price of the stock as listed on nasdaq for the date of grant 
the common and restricted common shares granted in and had a grant date fair value of and per share  respectively 
the grant date fair value of the stock options is determined using the black scholes option pricing model  using assumptions determined by management to be appropriate 
for the stock options granted during  we used a term of years  volatility of and a risk free rate of to  resulting in a weighted average grant date fair value of per share 
for the stock options granted during  we used a term of years  volatility of and a risk free rate of  resulting in a grant date fair value of per share 
the determination of the grant date fair value of the class b and class c shares was complex due to the waterfall  the distribution thresholds and the growth of the business  and it required the application of judgment regarding archipelago learning holdings  llc s future performance and the likelihood and timing of future liquidity events 
accordingly  in connection with the preparation of our audited financial statements for and  we hired waterview advisors formerly phalon george capital advisors  an independent valuation firm  to conduct valuation analyses  which were relied upon by management to assess the equity value of archipelago learning holdings  llc and the fair value of the class b and class c shares at the grant date 
the independent valuation analyses were prepared as of october and december and were relied upon by management for the determination of the grant date fair value of the january  may and may grants 
accordingly  these analyses were used to support our determination of the fair value of the awards as of the grant date 
the valuation analyses were based on information provided by us and used two methods to determine an overall enterprise value for archipelago learning holdings  llc i the use of multiples of archipelago learning holdings  llc s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  derived from prior archipelago learning holdings  llc transactions  principally the acquisition of the company by providence equity and the teacherweb acquisition and ii the use of ebitda multiples derived from transactions of companies within the same industry 
the valuation analyses also looked at comparable companies  but it was determined that this company comparison method would not be relevant in determining the valuation because of archipelago learning holdings  llc s smaller size  smaller market  faster growth and significantly greater profitability than comparable companies 
the multiples described above adjusted to reflect projected growth rates to projected ebitda in future periods were then applied to estimate projected overall enterprise values for archipelago learning holdings  llc at various dates in the future based on the probability that an initial public offering or strategic sale of archipelago learning holdings  llc would occur in the future 
using these enterprise values  the estimated distributions to the class b and class c shares at the time of such future liquidity events taking into account the applicable distribution thresholds were determined 
the present value of the estimated distributions to the class b shares and certain of the class c shares were then calculated to determine the fair value of class b and class c shares on the grant date 
this approach resulted in a grant date fair value for the class b shares of  and per share for the grants in  and  respectively  and a grant date fair value for the class c shares of  and per share for the grants in  and  respectively 
the change in the fair values primarily reflected the increase in the applicable distribution thresholds 

table of contents the following share based award activity occurred during the years ended december pre reorganization class b shares granted class c shares granted class b shares cancelled or forfeited class c shares cancelled or forfeited reorganization exchange of class b and class c shares for common stock exchange of class b and class c shares for restricted common stock post reorganization common stock issued restricted common stock issued stock options granted issuance consists of  shares issued in connection with the acquisition of educationcity in june such shares were issued in a private placement transaction 
see note  acquisition  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  for additional information on this transaction 
the remaining stock issuances were related to common shares issued as compensation to the board of directors 
the grant date fair value for the class b and class c shares granted in january reflected our strong operating performance in the last half of  the prevailing adverse market conditions  the financial crisis and reduced initial public offering and merger activity  the ongoing recession  the lack of a liquid market for the class b and class c shares  and the assumption that a liquidity event  such as an initial public offering or strategic sale  would not occur prior to but more likely in  when the market and overall economy were expected to recover  the decline in state tax receipts and the uncertainty in state education funding  the decision by congress in october to delay the reauthorization of the elementary and secondary education act commonly referred to during the bush administration as no child left behind and the further uncertainty in federal education funding  the impact of the priority of the class a shares as well as the class a shares that were issued in june  and the nearly doubled distribution thresholds applicable to the january grants as compared to the may grant 
it should also be noted that  applying the waterfall and distribution thresholds in the limited liability company agreement  at the january grant date  a liquidation event at the determined equity value on the date of grant would have resulted in no distributions to the class b and class c shares granted on such date 
we believe that the difference between the grant date fair value of the january grants and the initial public offering price is the result of the following factors our significantly stronger operating performance  improved stock market performance  improved prospects for a liquidity event as a result of an improved initial public offering market  improved economic conditions and the possible end of the recession  the enactment of the american recovery and reinvestment act of  the largest economic stimulus bill in history  which provided for approximately billion in education funding at the federal and state level  and the launch of our northstar learning postsecondary product line in april

fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this standard amends the disclosure guidance with respect to fair value measurements for both interim and annual reporting periods 
specifically  this standard requires new disclosures for significant transfers of assets or liabilities between level and level in the fair value hierarchy  separate disclosures for purchases  sales  issuances and settlements of level fair value items on a gross  rather than net basis  and more robust disclosure of the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure level and level assets and liabilities 
except for the detailed disclosures of changes in level items  which will be effective for us as of january   the remaining new disclosure requirements were effective for us as of january  we have included these new disclosures  as applicable  in note to the consolidated financial statements 
issued in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the new standard modifies the revenue recognition guidance for arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple elements to a customer at different times as part of a single revenue generating transaction 
the new standard provides principles and application guidance to determine whether multiple deliverables exist  how the individual deliverables should be separated and how to allocate the revenue in the arrangement among those separate deliverables 
the new standard allows the use of companies estimated selling prices as the value for deliverable elements under certain circumstances and to eliminate the use of the residual method for allocation of deliverable elements 
the new standard also expands the disclosure requirements for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the new standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   with earlier adoption permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this new standard will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in september  the fasb also issued asu no 
software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
this standard removes tangible products from the scope of software revenue recognition guidance and also provides guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible product  such as embedded software  are within the scope of the software revenue guidance 
the new standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   with earlier adoption permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this new standard will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued asu which will change the disclosures of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
the new standard clarifies that if a public entity completes a business combination and presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures under asc topic to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
asu is effective for any business combination we complete on or after january  the revised disclosure requirements will not affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our term loan and any borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
amounts borrowed under our term loan and our revolving credit facility bear interest at rates based upon a base rate or libor  plus an applicable margin 
to manage our interest rate exposure  and as a requirement under our term loan  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount totaling million  of which million remained in place upon the termination of the swap on december  the notional amount of the interest rate swap decreased in periodic amounts to a notional amount of million at the december termination date 
we swapped a floating rate payment based on three month libor for a fixed rate of in order to minimize the variability in expected future cash flow due to interest rate movements on our libor based variable rate debt 
due to the libor floor of and the short term libor rate at december   a increase or decrease in the short term libor rate would have no material impact on our interest rate on the term loan or our interest expense 
in addition  our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
our cash and cash equivalents are maintained primarily in short term  treasury backed accounts 
effects of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations in the periods presented 
we cannot assure you that future inflation will not affect our operating expense in future periods 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to potential gains or losses from foreign currency fluctuations 
our primary exposure is to changes in exchange rate for the us dollar versus the british pound sterling 
during the year ended december   approximately of our revenue was in a currency other than the us dollar 
based on annual foreign currency based revenue of million  a ten percent fluctuation in the foreign currency would result in an annual change in revenue of million 
a ten percent fluctuation in the foreign currency would not materially impact our foreign currency based net loss  which was only million for the year ended december  the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk related to its assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the us dollar 
historically  the company has not used derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk
