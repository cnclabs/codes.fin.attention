general park electrochemical corp 
park or the company is a global advanced materials company which develops  manufactures  markets and sells high technology digital and rf microwave printed circuit materials products principally for the telecommunications and internet infrastructure and high end computing markets and advanced composite materials  parts and assemblies products principally for the aerospace markets 
park s core capabilities are in the areas of polymer chemistry formulation and coating technology 
the company s manufacturing facilities are located in singapore  china  france  connecticut  kansas  arizona  california and washington 
the company s total net sales increased in the fiscal year ended february  compared to the fiscal year ended february  as a result of increases in sales of the company s printed circuit materials products in north america  asia and europe  following declines in the company s total net sales in the fiscal year ended february  compared to the fiscal year ended march  and in the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  as a result of decreases in sales of the company s printed circuit materials products in all three regions 
in the fiscal year  the increase in sales of the company s printed circuit materials products compared to the prior fiscal year was accompanied by a slight increase in sales of the company s advanced composite materials  parts and assemblies products compared to the prior fiscal year 
in the fiscal year  the decrease in sales of the company s printed circuit materials products compared to the prior fiscal year was accompanied by a decrease in sales of the company s advanced composite materials  parts and assemblies products compared to the prior fiscal year 
as a result of the increase in the company s total net sales in the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year  the company s earnings from operations in the fiscal year were higher than in the fiscal year as the company s gross profit margin  measured as a percentage of sales  improved to in the fiscal year compared to in the fiscal year 
the company s operating and earnings performances during the fiscal year also benefited from higher percentages of sales of higher margin  high performance printed circuit materials during the fiscal year 
however  the company s operating and earnings performances were adversely affected by losses incurred at the company s park aircraft technologies corp 
business unit in newton  kansas in the fiscal year as well as in the fiscal year 
the company s earnings from operations in the fiscal year were reduced by the pre tax charge of million recorded by the company in the three month period ended november  related to the closure  in january of  of the operations of neltec europe sas  the company s digital electronic materials business unit located in mirebeau  france 
despite the declines in the company s total net sales in the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year  the company s earnings from operations in the fiscal year were higher than in the fiscal year as the company s gross profit margins  measured as percentages of sales  improved to in the fiscal year compared to in the fiscal year 
the company s operating and earnings performances during the fiscal year benefited from higher percentages of sales of higher margin  high performance printed circuit materials during the fiscal year and lower costs resulting from the workforce reductions at the nelco products  inc  neltec  inc 
and nelco products pte 
ltd 
business units and the closures of the new england laminates co  inc and neltec europe sas business units in the fiscal year  all described elsewhere in this discussion 
however  the gross profit margin improvements during the fiscal year were partially offset by losses incurred at the company s park aircraft technologies corp 
business unit in newton  kansas 
the company s net earnings in the fiscal year were substantially higher than its net earnings in the fiscal year as a result of the company s strong operating performance in the fiscal year and despite the aforementioned million charge and despite the higher income tax provision in the fiscal year than in the fiscal year 
the company s net earnings for the fiscal year were lower than its net earnings for the fiscal year as a result of the lower net sales in the fiscal year and the significantly lower interest income in the fiscal year than in the fiscal year  and the company s net earnings for the fiscal year were significantly increased by the discontinued operations benefit of million described elsewhere in this discussion 
the company s net earnings for the fiscal year were impacted by a tax benefit of million for the reduction of certain deferred tax liabilities in singapore related to a temporary tax incentive for offshore interest repatriation and by a charge of million of additional tax reserves in the united states  both recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
such earnings were also impacted by a million tax benefit primarily for a retroactive extension of a development and expansion tax incentive in singapore  recorded in the third quarter of the fiscal year 
the company s net earnings for the fiscal year were significantly increased by a discontinued operations benefit of million recorded by the company in the fiscal year fourth quarter related to the elimination of a liability from discontinued operations of the company s dielektra gmbh subsidiary located in germany as a result of certain legal proceedings in germany 
the company s earnings were also increased by a tax benefit of million recorded by the company in the fiscal year fourth quarter related to the adjustment of certain valuation allowances and by a tax benefit of million recorded by the company in the fiscal year fourth quarter related to one time pre tax charges also recorded by the company in such quarter for the aforementioned closure of the company s new england laminates co  inc business unit and the closure of the company s neltec europe sas electronic materials business unit located in mirebeau  france and for a workforce reduction and an asset impairment at the company s nelco products pte 
ltd 
electronic materials and advanced composite materials business unit in singapore 
such benefits were partially offset by the one time pre tax charges of million recorded by the company in the fiscal year fourth quarter related to the aforementioned business unit closures  workforce reduction and asset impairment and by a one time pre tax charge of million recorded by the company in the fiscal year third quarter related to restructurings at certain of its north american and european business units 
because the markets for the company s printed circuit materials products in the and fiscal years had contracted from the levels that existed in the fiscal year  sales of the company s printed circuit materials products decreased in the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year and in the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year 
however  the markets in north america  asia and europe for the company s printed circuit materials products strengthened in the fiscal year third and fourth quarters after prevailing weakness in the fiscal year first and second quarters  and such strength continued in the fiscal year first  second and fourth quarters 
the markets for the company s advanced composite materials  parts and assemblies products weakened during the fiscal year third and fourth quarters  and such weakness continued during the fiscal year 
such markets showed some small signs of improvement during the fiscal year 
the global markets for the company s printed circuit materials products continue to be very difficult to forecast  and it is not clear to the company what the condition of the global markets for the company s printed circuit materials products will be in the fiscal year 
further  the company is not able to predict the impact the current global economic and financial conditions will have on the markets for its advanced composite materials  parts and assemblies products in the fiscal year 
as previously reported  in the first quarter of the company s fiscal year  the company acquired substantially all the assets and business of nova composites  inc  a manufacturer of composite parts and assemblies and the tooling for such parts and assemblies  located in lynnwood  washington  for a cash purchase price of million paid at the closing of the acquisition and up to an additional million payable over five years depending on the achievement of specified earn out objectives 
the company paid an additional million in the fiscal year second quarter and an additional million in the fiscal year first quarter  leaving up to an additional million payable over three years  as of february   depending on the achievement of the earn out objectives

the closure of neltec europe sas in january of was a major component of restructurings of the operations of the company s neltec europe sas and neltec sa business units in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year in response to the continuing serious erosion of the markets for electronic materials in europe and the continuing migration of such markets to asia 
the market for such products in europe had eroded to the point where the company believed it was not possible for the neltec europe sas business to be viable  and as a major component of such restructurings  neltec europe sas closed completely its operations 
although the company is continuing the operations of its neltec sa rf microwave electronic materials business unit  the restructurings included a reorganization of certain of the activities of neltec sa 
in addition to the restructurings of its neltec europe sas and neltec sa business units in france  the company implemented workforce reductions at its nelco products  inc electronic materials business unit located in fullerton  california and its neltec  inc electronics circuitry materials business unit located in tempe  arizona in the third quarter of its fiscal year and recorded a charge of million in such quarter for such workforce reductions and for the restructuring at its neltec sa business unit in lannemezan  france

the company believes that  as a general matter  its policies  practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and that its handling  manufacture  use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances are in accord with environmental laws and regulations 
however  mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies  which were generally in compliance with applicable laws at the time of the operations in question  the company  like other companies engaged in similar businesses  is a party to claims by government agencies and third parties and has incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs associated with environmental matters 
additional claims and costs involving past environmental matters may continue to arise in the future 
it is the company policy to record appropriate liabilities for such matters when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
in the and fiscal years  the company reversed accruals of  and  respectively  for environmental remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs  which were recorded as reductions to selling  general and administrative expenses for such years  as a result of the company s conclusion that the likelihood of any liability in connection with such accruals was remote 
while annual expenditures have generally been constant from year to year  and may increase over time  the company expects it will be able to fund such expenditures from cash flow from operations 
the timing of expenditures depends on a number of factors  including regulatory approval of cleanup projects  remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties 
at february  and february   the amounts recorded in accrued liabilities for environmental matters were  and  respectively

critical accounting policies and estimates the following information is provided regarding critical accounting policies that are important to the consolidated financial statements and that entail  to a significant extent  the use of estimates  assumptions and the application of management judgment 
general the company discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to sales allowances  allowances for doubtful accounts  inventories  valuation of long lived assets  income taxes  restructurings  contingencies and litigation  and employee benefit programs 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues when products are shipped and title has been transferred to a customer  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
all material sales transactions are for the shipment of manufactured prepreg and laminate products and advanced composite materials  parts and assemblies 
sales allowances the company provides for the estimated costs of sales allowances at the time such costs can be reasonably estimated 
the company s products are made to customer specifications and tested for adherence to such specifications before shipment to customers 
composite parts and assemblies may be subject to airworthiness acceptance by customers after receipt at the customers locations 
there are no future performance requirements other than the products meeting the agreed specifications 
the company s bases for providing sales allowances for returns are known situations in which products may have failed due to manufacturing defects in the products supplied by the company 
the company is focused on manufacturing the highest quality printed circuit materials and advanced composite materials  parts and assemblies possible and employs stringent manufacturing process controls and works with raw material suppliers who have dedicated themselves to complying with the company s specifications and technical requirements 
the amounts of returns and allowances resulting from defective or damaged products have been approximately of sales for each of the company s last three fiscal years 
allowances for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are due within established payment terms and are stated at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts outstanding longer than established payment terms are considered past due 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors  including the length of time accounts receivable are past due  the company s previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation to the company  and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
if the financial condition of the company customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketability based upon the age of the inventory and assumptions about future demand for the company products and market conditions 
valuation of long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
in addition  the company assesses the impairment of goodwill at least annually 
important factors that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes in the use of the company s assets or strategy of the overall business 
income taxes as part of the processes of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate the income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the carrying value of the company net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company consolidated statement of operations  or conversely to further reduce the existing valuation allowance resulting in less income tax expense 
the company evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and assesses the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly 
tax benefits are recognized for an uncertain tax position when  in the company s judgment  it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority 
for a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold  the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount that is judged to have a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority 
the liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances and when new information becomes available 
such adjustments are recognized entirely in the period in which they are identified 
the effective tax rate includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as considered appropriate by the company 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  the company believes its liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adequate 
interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as income tax expense
