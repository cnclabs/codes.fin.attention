item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
active selling communities communities approved homes homes delivered contracted not delivered remaining homes available northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west total includes home sites under option 
of the total remaining homes available   were under construction or completed including models and sales offices and  were under option 
backlog at october  and  including unconsolidated joint ventures  we had a backlog of signed contracts for  homes and  homes  respectively  with sales values aggregating million and million  respectively 
the majority of our backlog at october  is expected to be completed and closed within the next months 
at november  and  our backlog of signed contracts  including unconsolidated joint ventures  was  homes and  homes  respectively  with sales values aggregating million and million  respectively 
sales of our homes typically are made pursuant to a standard sales contract that provides the customer with a statutorily mandated right of rescission for a period ranging up to days after execution 
this contract requires a nominal customer deposit at the time of signing 
in addition  in the northeast  mid atlantic  and some sections of the midwest and southeast  we typically obtain an additional to down payment due within to days after signing 
the contract may include a financing contingency  which permits customers to cancel their obligation in the event mortgage financing at prevailing interest rates including financing arranged or provided by us is unobtainable within the period specified in the contract 
this contingency period typically is four to eight weeks following the date of execution 
when housing values decline in certain markets  some customers cancel their contracts and forfeit their deposits 
cancellation rates are discussed further in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
sales contracts are included in backlog once the sales contract is signed by the customer  which in some cases includes contracts that are in the rescission or cancellation periods 
however  revenues from sales of homes are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations  when title to the home is conveyed to the buyer  adequate initial and continuing investment have been received and there is no continued involvement 
residential land inventory in planning it is our objective to control a supply of land  primarily through options  whenever possible  consistent with anticipated homebuilding requirements in each of our housing markets 
controlled land as of october   exclusive of communities under development described above under active selling communities and excluding unconsolidated joint ventures  is summarized in the following table 
the proposed developable home sites in communities in planning are included in the  consolidated total home sites under the total residential real estate chart in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
communities in planning dollars in thousands number of proposed communities proposed developable home sites total land option price book value northeast under option owned total mid atlantic under option owned total midwest under option owned total southeast under option owned total southwest under option owned total west under option owned total totals under option owned combined total properties under option also include costs incurred on properties not under option but which are under evaluation 
for properties under option  as of october   option fees and deposits aggregated approximately million 
as of october   we spent an additional million in nonrefundable predevelopment costs on such properties 
we either option or acquire improved or unimproved home sites from land developers or other sellers 
under a typical agreement with the land developer  we purchase a minimal number of home sites 
the balance of the home sites to be purchased is covered under an option agreement or a nonrecourse purchase agreement 
as a result of the declining homebuilding market  we have decided to mothball or stop development on certain communities for which we have determined that current market conditions do not justify further investment at this time 
when we decide to mothball a community  the inventory is reclassified from sold and unsold homes and lots under development to land and land options held for future development or sale 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on mothballed communities 
for additional financial information regarding our homebuilding segments  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
raw materials the homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced raw material and labor shortages 
in particular  shortages and fluctuations in the price of lumber or in other important raw materials could result in delays in the start or completion of or increase the cost of  developing one or more of our residential communities 
we attempt to maintain efficient operations by utilizing standardized materials available from a variety of sources 
in addition  we generally contract with subcontractors to construct our homes 
we have reduced construction and administrative costs by consolidating the number of vendors serving certain markets and by executing national purchasing contracts with select vendors 
seasonality our business is seasonal in nature and  historically  weather related problems  typically in the fall  late winter and early spring  can delay starts or closings and increase costs 
competition our homebuilding operations are highly competitive 
we are among the top homebuilders in the united states in both homebuilding revenues and home deliveries 
we compete with numerous real estate developers in each of the geographic areas in which we operate 
our competition ranges from small local builders to larger regional builders to publicly owned builders and developers  some of which have greater sales and financial resources than we do 
previously owned homes and the availability of rental housing provide additional competition 
we compete primarily on the basis of reputation  price  location  design  quality  service  and amenities 
regulation and environmental matters we are subject to various local  state  and federal statutes  ordinances  rules  and regulations concerning zoning  building design  construction  and similar matters  including local regulations which impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular locality 
in addition  we are subject to registration and filing requirements in connection with the construction  advertisement  and sale of our communities in certain states and localities in which we operate even if all necessary government approvals have been obtained 
we may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing communities due to building moratoriums that could be implemented in the future in the states in which we operate 
generally  such moratoriums relate to insufficient water or sewerage facilities or inadequate road capacity 
in addition  some state and local governments in markets where we operate have approved  and others may approve  slow growth or no growth initiatives that could negatively affect the availability of land and building opportunities within those areas 
approval of these initiatives could adversely affect our ability to build and sell homes in the affected markets and or could require the satisfaction of additional administrative and regulatory requirements  which could result in slowing the progress or increasing the costs of our homebuilding operations in these markets 
any such delays or costs could have a negative effect on our future revenues and earnings 
we are also subject to a variety of local  state  federal  and foreign laws and regulations concerning protection of health and the environment environmental laws 
the particular environmental laws which apply to any given community vary greatly according to the community site  the site s environmental conditions  and the present and former uses of the site 
these environmental laws may result in delays  may cause us to incur substantial compliance  remediation  and or other costs  and prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity 
despite our past ability to obtain necessary permits and approvals for our communities  we anticipate that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on developers and homebuilders in the future 
although we cannot predict the effect of these requirements  they could result in time consuming and expensive compliance programs and in substantial expenditures  which could cause delays and increase our cost of operations 
in addition  the continued effectiveness of permits already granted or approvals already obtained is dependent upon many factors  some of which are beyond our control  such as changes in policies  rules  and regulations and their interpretation and application 
item a risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks in addition to the other information included in this annual report form k  including the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
the homebuilding industry is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions  real estate markets  and weather and other environmental conditions  which could affect our ability to build homes at prices our customers are willing or able to pay  could reduce profits that may not be recaptured  could result in cancellation of sales contracts  and could affect our liquidity 
the homebuilding industry is cyclical  has from time to time experienced significant difficulties  and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions such as employment levels and job growth  availability of financing for home buyers  interest rates  foreclosure rates  inflation  adverse changes in tax laws  consumer confidence  housing demand  population growth  and availability of water supply in locations in which we operate 
turmoil in the financial markets could affect our liquidity 
in addition  our cash balances are primarily invested in short term government backed instruments 
the remaining cash balances are held at numerous financial institutions and may  at times  exceed insurable amounts 
we seek to mitigate this risk by depositing our cash in major financial institutions and diversifying our investments 
in addition  our homebuilding operations often require us to obtain letters of credit 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we terminated our revolving credit facility and refinanced the borrowing capacity thereunder 
in addition  we entered into certain stand alone letter of credit facilities  and agreements pursuant to which all of the outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facility were replaced with letters of credit issued under such new letter of credit facilities and agreements 
however  we may need additional letters of credit above the amounts provided under these new letter of credit facilities and agreements 
if we are unable to obtain such additional letters of credit as needed to operate our business  we may be adversely affected 
weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes  tornadoes  earthquakes  floods  droughts  fires and other environmental conditions can harm the local homebuilding business 
for example  our business in florida was adversely affected in late and into due to the effects of hurricane wilma on materials and labor availability and pricing 
conversely  hurricane ike  which hit houston in september  did not have an effect on materials and labor availability or pricing  but did affect the volume of home sales in subsequent weeks 
in august  hurricane irene caused widespread flooding and disruptions on the atlantic seaboard  which impacted our sales and construction activity in affected markets during that month 
the difficulties described above could cause us to take longer and incur more costs to build our homes 
we may not be able to recapture increased costs by raising prices in many cases because we fix our prices up to months in advance of delivery by signing home sales contracts 
in addition  some home buyers may cancel or not honor their home sales contracts altogether 
the homebuilding industry is undergoing a significant and sustained downturn which has  and could continue to  materially and adversely affect our business  liquidity  and results of operations 
the homebuilding industry is now experiencing a significant and sustained downturn 
an industry wide softening of demand for new homes has resulted from a lack of consumer confidence  decreased availability of mortgage financing  and large supplies of resale and new home inventories  among other factors 
in addition  an oversupply of alternatives to new homes  such as rental properties  resale homes  and foreclosures  has depressed prices and reduced margins for the sale of new homes 
industry conditions had a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in fiscal years through and may continue to materially adversely affect our business and results of operations in future years as we do not predict a sustained upturn in the near term 
further  we substantially increased our inventory through fiscal  which required significant cash outlays and which has increased our price and margin exposure as we continue to work through this inventory 
looking forward  if the housing market continues to deteriorate  it will continue to be difficult to generate positive cash flow especially as we invest in land to fund future homebuilding 
general economic conditions in the us remain weak 
market volatility has been unprecedented and extraordinary in the last several years  and the resulting economic turmoil may continue to exacerbate industry conditions or have other unforeseen consequences  leading to uncertainty about future conditions in the homebuilding industry 
continuation or worsening of this downturn or general economic conditions would continue to have a material adverse effect on our business  liquidity  and results of operations 
in addition  an increase in the default rate on the mortgages we originate may adversely affect our ability to sell mortgages or the pricing we receive upon the sale of mortgages 
although substantially all of the mortgage loans we originate are sold in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released  non recourse basis  we remain liable for certain limited representations  such as fraud  and warranties related to loan sales 
as default rates rise  this may increase our potential exposure regarding mortgage loan sales because investors may seek to have us buy back or make whole investors for mortgages we previously sold 
to date  we have not made significant payments related to our mortgage loans but because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters  actual future payments could differ significantly from our currently estimated amounts 
there can be no assurances that government responses to the disruptions in the financial markets will restore consumer confidence  stabilize the markets  or increase liquidity and the availability of credit  or whether any such results will be sustainable 
the housing market has benefited from a number of government programs  including tax credits for home buyers provided by the federal government and certain state governments  including california  and support of the mortgage market  including through purchases of mortgage backed securities by the federal reserve bank and the underwriting of a substantial amount of new mortgages by the federal housing administration fha and other governmental agencies 
these programs are expected to wind down over time  for example the california tax credit ended in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the federal tax credit expired in april in addition  in fiscal  the us department of housing and urban development hud tightened fha underwriting standards 
the maximum size of mortgage loans that are treated as conforming by fannie mae and freddie mac was reduced on october   which could further weaken home sales  as mortgages may become more expensive 
housing markets may further decline as these programs are modified or terminated 
our leverage places burdens on our ability to comply with the terms of our indebtedness  may restrict our ability to operate  may prevent us from fulfilling our obligations  and may adversely affect our financial condition 
we have a significant amount of debt 
our debt excluding nonrecourse secured debt and debt of our financial subsidiaries  as of october   including the debt of the subsidiaries that guarantee our debt  was  million  million net of discount  and our debt service payments for the month period ended october  were million  substantially all of which represented interest incurred and the remainder of which represented payments on the principal of the amortizing notes as defined below  and do not include principal and interest on nonrecourse secured debt  debt of our financial subsidiaries and fees under our letter of credit facilities and agreements 
in addition  as of october   we had million in aggregate outstanding face amount of letters of credit issued under various letter of credit facilities and agreements  which were collateralized by million of cash 
our fees for these letters of credit for the months ended october   which are based on both the used and unused portion of the facilities and agreements  were million 
we also had substantial contractual commitments and contingent obligations  including approximately million of performance bonds as of october  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contractual obligations 
our significant amount of debt could have important consequences 
for example  it could limit our ability to obtain future financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements  or other requirements  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of our debt and reduce our ability to use our cash flow for other purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business  place us at a competitive disadvantage because we have more debt than some of our competitors  and make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business and general economic conditions 
our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations will depend upon our future performance 
we are engaged in businesses that are substantially affected by changes in economic cycles 
our revenues and earnings vary with the level of general economic activity in the markets we serve 
our businesses are also affected by customer sentiment and financial  political  business  and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through the sale of equity securities  the refinancing of debt  or the sale of assets 
changes in prevailing interest rates may affect our ability to meet our debt service obligations to the extent we have any floating rate indebtedness 
a higher interest rate on our debt service obligations could result in lower earnings or increased losses 
our sources of liquidity are limited and may not be sufficient to meet our needs 
in connection with the issuance of our senior secured notes due in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we terminated our revolving credit facility and refinanced the borrowing capacity thereunder 
because we no longer have a revolving credit facility  we are dependent on our current cash balance and future cash flows from operations which may not be positive to enable us to service our indebtedness  to cover our operating expenses  and or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we used million in operating activities in the fiscal year ended october   and expect to continue to generate negative cash flow  after taking into account land purchases 
if the homebuilding industry does not experience improved conditions over the next several years  our cash flows could be insufficient to fund our obligations and support land purchases  if we cannot buy additional land we would ultimately be unable to generate future revenues from the sale of houses 
in addition  we may need to further refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity  which we may not be able to do on favorable terms or at all 
if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations or we are unable to refinance our indebtedness  we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures  or to sell assets  seek additional capital  or restructure our indebtedness 
these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our debt service obligations 
we have also entered into certain cash collateralized letter of credit agreements and facilities that require us to maintain specified amounts of cash in segregated accounts as collateral to support our letters of credit issued thereunder  which will affect the amount of cash we have available for other uses 
if our available cash and capital resources are insufficient to meet our debt service and other obligations  we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations 
we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or the proceeds from the dispositions may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 
for additional information about capital resources and liquidity  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources and liquidity 
restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may restrict our and certain of our subsidiaries ability to operate and if our financial performance worsens  we may not be able to undertake transactions within the restrictions of our debt instruments 
the indentures governing our outstanding debt securities impose certain restrictions on our and certain of our subsidiaries operations and activities 
the most significant restrictions relate to debt incurrence  creating liens  sales of assets  cash distributions  including paying dividends on common and preferred stock  capital stock and debt repurchases  and investments by us and certain of our subsidiaries 
because of these restrictions  we are currently prohibited from paying dividends on our common and preferred stock and anticipate that we will remain prohibited for the foreseeable future 
the restrictions in our debt instruments could prohibit or restrict our and certain of our subsidiaries activities such as undertaking capital raising or restructuring activities or entering into other transactions 
in such a situation  we may be unable to amend the instrument or obtain a waiver 
in addition  if we fail to make timely payments on this debt and other material indebtedness  our debt under these debt instruments could become due and payable prior to maturity 
in such a situation  there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain alternative financing 
either situation could have a material adverse effect on the solvency of the company 
the terms of our debt instruments allow us to incur additional indebtedness 
under the terms of our indebtedness under our indentures  we have the ability  subject to our debt covenants  to incur additional amounts of debt 
the incurrence of additional indebtedness could magnify the risks described above 
in addition  certain obligations such as standby letters of credit and performance bonds issued in the ordinary course of business  including those issued under our stand alone letter of credit agreements and facilities  are not considered indebtedness under our indentures and may be secured  and therefore  are not subject to limits in our debt covenants 
we could be adversely affected by a negative change in our credit rating 
our ability to access capital on favorable terms is a key factor in our ability to service our indebtedness to cover our operating expenses  and to fund our other liquidity needs 
during fiscal and thereafter  credit agencies took a series of negative actions  including downgrades  with respect to their credit ratings of us and our debt 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation liquidity and capital resources 
downgrades may make it more difficult and costly for us to access capital 
therefore  any further downgrade by any of the principal credit agencies may exacerbate these difficulties 
there can be no assurances that our credit ratings will not be further downgraded in the future  whether as a result of deteriorating general economic conditions  a more protracted downturn in the housing industry  failure to successfully implement our operating strategy  the adverse impact on our results of operations or liquidity position of any of the above  or otherwise 
our business is seasonal in nature and our quarterly operating results can fluctuate 
our quarterly operating results generally fluctuate by season 
the construction of a customer s home typically begins after signing the agreement of sale and can take months or more to complete 
weather related problems  typically in the fall  late winter and early spring  can delay starts or closings and increase costs and thus reduce profitability 
in addition  delays in opening communities could have an adverse effect on our sales and revenues 
due to these factors  our quarterly operating results will likely continue to fluctuate 
our success depends on the availability of suitable undeveloped land and improved lots at acceptable prices and our having sufficient liquidity to fund such investments 
our success in developing land and in building and selling homes depends in part upon the continued availability of suitable undeveloped land and improved lots at acceptable prices 
the availability of undeveloped land and improved lots for purchase at favorable prices depends on a number of factors outside of our control  including the risk of competitive over bidding on land and lots and restrictive governmental regulation 
should suitable land opportunities become less available  the number of homes we may be able to build and sell would be reduced  which would reduce revenue and profits 
in addition  our ability to make land purchases will depend upon us having sufficient liquidity to fund such purchases 
we may be at a disadvantage in competing for land due to our significant debt obligations  which require substantial cash resources 
raw material and labor shortages and price fluctuations could delay or increase the cost of home construction and adversely affect our operating results 
the homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced raw material and labor shortages 
in particular  shortages and fluctuations in the price of lumber or in other important raw materials could result in delays in the start or completion of  or increase the cost of  developing one or more of our residential communities 
in addition  we contract with subcontractors to construct our homes 
therefore  the timing and quality of our construction depends on the availability  skill  and cost of our subcontractors 
delays or cost increases caused by shortages and price fluctuations could harm our operating results  the impact of which may be further affected depending on our ability to raise sales prices to offset increased costs 
changes in economic and market conditions could result in the sale of homes at a loss or holding land in inventory longer than planned  the cost of which can be significant 
land inventory risk can be substantial for homebuilders 
we must continuously seek and make acquisitions of land for expansion into new markets and for replacement and expansion of land inventory within our current markets 
the market value of undeveloped land  buildable lots  and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing economic and market conditions 
in the event of significant changes in economic or market conditions  we may have to sell homes at a loss or hold land in inventory longer than planned 
in the case of land options  we could choose not to exercise them  in which case we would write off the value of these options 
inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing project or market 
the assessment of communities for indication of impairment is performed quarterly 
while we consider available information to determine what we believe to be our best estimates as of the reporting period  these estimates are subject to change in future reporting periods as facts and circumstances change 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation critical accounting policies 
for example  during fiscal  and  we decided not to exercise many option contracts and walked away from land option deposits and predevelopment costs  which resulted in land option write offs of million  million and million  respectively 
also  in fiscal  and  as a result of the difficult market conditions  we recorded inventory impairment losses on owned property of million  million and million  respectively 
if market conditions continue to worsen  additional inventory impairment losses and land option write offs will likely be necessary 
home prices and sales activities in the california  maryland  new jersey  texas and virginia markets have a large impact on our results of operations because we conduct a significant portion of our business in these markets 
we presently conduct a significant portion of our business in the california  maryland  new jersey  texas and virginia markets 
home prices and sales activities in these markets and in most of the other markets in which we operate have declined from time to time  particularly as a result of slow economic growth 
in particular  market conditions in california  maryland  new jersey and virginia have declined significantly since the end of furthermore  precarious economic and budget situations at the state government level may adversely affect the market for our homes in those affected areas 
if home prices and sales activity decline in one or more of the markets in which we operate  our costs may not decline at all or at the same rate and may negatively impact our results of operations 
because almost all of our customers require mortgage financing  increases in interest rates or the decreased availability of mortgage financing could impair the affordability of our homes  lower demand for our products  limit our marketing effectiveness  and limit our ability to fully realize our backlog 
virtually all of our customers finance their acquisitions through lenders providing mortgage financing 
increases in interest rates or decreases in availability of mortgage financing could lower demand for new homes because of the increased monthly mortgage costs to potential home buyers 
even if potential customers do not need financing  changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to sell their existing homes to potential buyers who need financing 
this could prevent or limit our ability to attract new customers as well as our ability to fully realize our backlog because our sales contracts generally include a financing contingency 
financing contingencies permit the customer to cancel its obligation in the event mortgage financing at prevailing interest rates  including financing arranged or provided by us  is unobtainable within the period specified in the contract 
this contingency period is typically four to eight weeks following the date of execution of the sales contract 
starting in  many lenders have been significantly tightening their underwriting standards  and subprime and other alternative mortgage products are no longer being made available in the marketplace 
if these trends continue and mortgage loans continue to be difficult to obtain  the ability and willingness of prospective buyers to finance home purchases or to sell their existing homes will be adversely affected  which will adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  we believe that the availability of mortgage financing  including federal national mortgage association  federal home loan mortgage corp  and fha va financing  is an important factor in marketing many of our homes 
the maximum size of mortgage loans that are treated as conforming by fannie mae and freddie mac was reduced on october   which could further weaken home sales  as mortgages may become more expensive 
in addition  in fiscal  hud tightened fha underwriting standards 
any limitations or restrictions on the availability of those types of financing could reduce our sales 
increases in the after tax costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business or financial results 
significant expenses of owning a home  including mortgage interest expenses and real estate taxes  generally are deductible expenses for an individual s federal  and in some cases state  income taxes  subject to limitations under current tax law and policy 
if the federal government or a state government were to change its income tax laws to eliminate or substantially limit these income tax deductions  as has been discussed from time to time  the after tax cost of owning a new home would increase for many of our potential customers 
the loss or reduction of these homeowner tax deductions  if such tax law changes were enacted without any offsetting legislation  would adversely impact demand for and sales prices of new homes  including ours 
in addition  increases in property tax rates or fees on developers by local governmental authorities  as experienced in response to reduced federal and state funding or to fund local initiatives such as funding schools or road improvements  can adversely affect the ability of potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to purchase new homes  and can have an adverse impact on our business and financial results 
we conduct certain of our operations through unconsolidated joint ventures with independent third parties in which we do not have a controlling interest 
these investments involve risks and are highly illiquid 
we currently operate through a number of unconsolidated homebuilding and land development joint ventures with independent third parties in which we do not have a controlling interest 
at october   we had invested an aggregate of million in these joint ventures  including advances to these joint ventures of approximately million 
in addition  as part of our strategy  we intend to continue to evaluate additional joint venture opportunities 
these investments involve risks and are highly illiquid 
there are a limited number of sources willing to provide acquisition  development  and construction financing to land development and homebuilding joint ventures  and as market conditions become more challenging  it may be difficult or impossible to obtain financing for our joint ventures on commercially reasonable terms 
recently  we have been unable to obtain financing for newly created joint ventures 
in addition  we lack a controlling interest in these joint ventures and  therefore  are usually unable to require that our joint ventures sell assets or return invested capital  make additional capital contributions  or take any other action without the vote of at least one of our venture partners 
therefore  absent partner agreement  we will be unable to liquidate our joint venture investments to generate cash 
homebuilders are subject to a number of federal  local  state  and foreign laws and regulations concerning the development of land  the homebuilding  sales and customer financing processes and the protection of the environment  which can cause us to incur delays and costs associated with compliance and which can prohibit or restrict our activity in some regions or areas 
we are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations that affect the development of land and home building  sales and customer financing processes  including zoning  density  building standards and mortgage financing 
these laws and regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities 
this can delay or increase the cost of development or homebuilding 
in light of recent developments in the home building industry and the financial markets  federal  state  or local governments may seek to adopt regulations that limit or prohibit homebuilders from providing mortgage financing to their customers 
if adopted  any such regulations could adversely affect future revenues and earnings 
in addition  some state and local governments in markets where we operate have approved  and others may approve  slow growth or no growth initiatives that could negatively impact the availability of land and building opportunities within those areas 
approval of these initiatives could adversely affect our ability to build and sell homes in the affected markets and or could require the satisfaction of additional administrative and regulatory requirements  which could result in slowing the progress or increasing the costs of our homebuilding operations in these markets 
any such delays or costs could have a negative effect on our future revenues and earnings 
we also are subject to a variety of local  state  federal and foreign laws and regulations concerning protection of health and the environment 
the particular environmental laws and regulations that apply to any given community vary greatly according to the community site  the site s environmental conditions and the present and former uses of the site 
these environmental laws and regulations may result in delays  may cause us to incur substantial compliance  remediation and or other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity 
for example  the company engaged in discussions with the us environmental protection agency epa and the us department of justice doj regarding alleged violations of storm water discharge requirements 
in resolution of this matter  in april we agreed to the terms of a consent decree with the epa  doj and the states of virginia  maryland  west virginia and the district of columbia collectively  the states 
the consent decree was approved by the federal district court in august under the terms of the consent decree  we have paid a fine of million collectively to the united states and the states named above and have agreed to perform under the terms of the consent decree for a minimum of three years  which includes implementing certain operational and training measures nationwide to facilitate ongoing compliance with storm water regulations 
we anticipate that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on developers and homebuilders in the future 
although we cannot predict the effect of these requirements  they could result in time consuming and expensive compliance programs and in substantial expenditures  which could cause delays and increase our cost of operations 
in addition  our ability to obtain or renew permits or approvals and the continued effectiveness of permits already granted to us or approvals already obtained by us is dependent upon many factors  some of which are beyond our control  such as changes in policies  rules  laws and regulations  and changes in their interpretation and application 
product liability litigation and warranty claims that arise in the ordinary course of business may be costly 
as a homebuilder  we are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
such claims are common in the homebuilding industry and can be costly 
in addition  the amount and scope of coverage offered by insurance companies is currently limited  and this coverage may be further restricted and become more costly 
if we are not able to obtain adequate insurance against such claims  we may experience losses that could hurt our financial results 
our financial results could also be adversely affected if we were to experience an unusually high number of claims or unusually severe claims 
we have received construction defect and home warranty claims associated with allegedly defective drywall manufactured in china chinese drywall that may be responsible for noxious smells and accelerated corrosion of certain metals in certain homes we have developed 
we have remediated certain such homes and have received claims or notices regarding homes with chinese drywall that may require remediation 
in addition  we are involved  among a number of other defendants  in a multidistrict litigation in which homes are alleged to have chinese drywall requiring remediation 
these homes are located in our florida and houston markets 
our estimated liability in this matter is reserved 
if additional homes are identified to have the chinese drywall issue  or our actual costs to remediate differ from our current estimated costs  we may be required to revise our construction defect and home warranty reserves 
mortgage investors could seek to have us buy back loans or compensate them for losses incurred on mortgages we have sold based on claims that we breached our limited representations or warranties 
our financial services segment originates mortgages  primarily for our homebuilding customers 
substantially all of the mortgage loans originated are sold within a short period of time in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released  nonrecourse basis  although we remain liable for certain limited representations  such as fraud  and warranties related to loan sales 
accordingly  mortgage investors have in the past and could in the future seek to have us buy back loans or compensate them for losses incurred on mortgages we have sold based on claims that we breached our limited representations or warranties 
we believe there continues to be an industry wide issue with the number of purchaser claims in which purchasers purport to have found inaccuracies related to sellers representations and warranties in particular loan sale agreements 
to date  we have not made significant payments to the purchasers of our loans in relation to such claims and we have established reserves for potential losses  however there can be no assurance that we will not have significant liabilities in respect of such claims in the future  which could exceed our reserves  or that the impact of such claims on our results of operations will not be material 
we compete on several levels with homebuilders that may have greater sales and financial resources  which could hurt future earnings 
we compete not only for home buyers but also for desirable properties  financing  raw materials  and skilled labor often within larger subdivisions designed  planned  and developed by other homebuilders 
our competitors include other local  regional  and national homebuilders  some of which have greater sales and financial resources 
the competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry together with current market conditions have  and could continue to  result in difficulty in acquiring suitable land at acceptable prices  increased selling incentives  lower sales  or delays in construction 
any of these problems could increase costs and or lower profit margins 
we may have difficulty in obtaining the additional financing required to operate and develop our business 
our operations require significant amounts of cash  and we may be required to seek additional capital  whether from sales of equity or borrowing additional money  for the future growth and development of our business 
the terms or availability of additional capital is uncertain 
moreover  the indentures for our outstanding debt securities contain provisions that restrict the debt we may incur in the future and our ability to pay dividends on equity 
if we are not successful in obtaining sufficient capital  it could reduce our sales and may hinder our future growth and results of operations 
in addition  pledging substantially all of our assets to support our senior secured notes may make it more difficult to raise additional financing in the future 
our future growth may include additional acquisitions of companies that may not be successfully integrated and may not achieve expected benefits 
acquisitions of companies have contributed to our historical growth and may again be a component of our growth strategy in the future 
in the future  we may acquire businesses  some of which may be significant 
as a result of acquisitions of companies  we may need to seek additional financing and integrate product lines  dispersed operations  and distinct corporate cultures 
these integration efforts may not succeed or may distract our management from operating our existing business 
additionally  we may not be able to enhance our earnings as a result of acquisitions 
our failure to successfully identify and manage future acquisitions could harm our operating results 
our controlling stockholders are able to exercise significant influence over us 
members of the hovnanian family  including ara k 
hovnanian  our chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer  have voting control  through personal holdings  the limited partnership established for members of mr 
hovnanian family and family trusts  of class a and class b common stock that enables them to cast approximately of the votes that may be cast by the holders of our outstanding class a and class b common stock combined 
their combined stock ownership enables them to exert significant control over us  including power to control the election of the board and to approve matters presented to our stockholders 
this concentration of ownership may also make some transactions  including mergers or other changes in control  more difficult or impossible without their support 
also  because of their combined voting power  circumstances may occur in which their interests could be in conflict with the interests of other stakeholders 
our net operating loss carryforwards could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the internal revenue code 
based on recent impairments and our current financial performance  we generated a federal net operating loss carryforward of billion through the fiscal year ended october   and we may generate net operating loss carryforwards in future years 
section of the internal revenue code the code contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change  which is generally any change in ownership of more than of its stock over a three year period  to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and certain built in losses recognized in years after the ownership change 
these rules generally operate by focusing on ownership shifts among stockholders owning directly or indirectly or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company 
if we undergo an ownership change for purposes of section as a result of future transactions involving our stock  including purchases or sales of stock between shareholders  our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and to recognize certain built in losses would be subject to the limitations of section depending on the resulting limitation  a significant portion of our net operating loss carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them 
a limitation imposed under section on our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in august  we announced that the board adopted a shareholder rights plan the rights plan designed to preserve shareholder value and the value of certain tax assets primarily associated with net loss carryforwards and built in losses under section of the code  and on december   our stockholders approved the board s decision to adopt the rights plan 
the rights plan is intended to act as a deterrent to any person or group acquiring or more of our outstanding class a common stock any such person an acquiring person  without the approval of the company s board of directors 
subject to the terms  provisions and conditions of the rights plan  if and when they become exercisable  each right would entitle its holder to purchase from the company one ten thousandth of a share of the company s series b junior preferred stock for a purchase price of per share 
the rights will not be exercisable until the earlier of i business days after a public announcement by us that a person or group has become an acquiring person and ii business days after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer by a person or group for of the class a common stock 
if issued  each fractional share of series b junior preferred stock would give the stockholder approximately the same dividend  voting and liquidation rights as does one share of the company s class a common stock 
however  prior to exercise  a right does not give its holder any rights as a stockholder of the company  including without limitation any dividend  voting or liquidation rights 
in addition  on december   our stockholders approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to restrict certain transfers of our common stock in order to preserve the tax treatment of our net operating loss carryforwards and built in losses under section of the code 
subject to certain exceptions pertaining to pre existing stockholders and class b stockholders  the transfer restrictions in the amended certificate of incorporation generally restrict any direct or indirect transfer such as transfers of the company s stock that result from the transfer of interests in other entities that own the company s stock if the effect would be to i increase the direct or indirect ownership of the company s stock by any person or public group from less than to or more of the company s stock  ii increase the percentage of the company s stock owned directly or indirectly by a person or public group owning or deemed to own or more of the company s stock  or iii create a new public group as defined in the applicable treasury regulations 
utility shortages and outages or rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our operations 
in prior years  the areas in which we operate in california have experienced power shortages  including periods without electrical power  as well as significant fluctuations in utility costs 
we may incur additional costs and may not be able to complete construction on a timely basis if such power shortages outages and utility rate fluctuations continue 
furthermore  power shortages and outages  such as the blackout that occurred in in the northeast  and rate fluctuations may adversely affect the regional economies in which we operate  which may reduce demand for our homes 
our operations may be adversely affected if further rate fluctuations and or power shortages and outages occur in california  the northeast  or in our other markets 
geopolitical risks and market disruption could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
geopolitical events  such as the aftermath of the war with iraq and the continuing involvement in iraq and afghanistan  may have a substantial impact on the economy and the housing market 
the terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on september  had an impact on our business and the occurrence of similar events in the future cannot be ruled out 
the war and the continuing involvement in iraq and afghanistan  terrorism  and related geopolitical risks have created many economic and political uncertainties  some of which may have additional material adverse effects on the us economy  and our customers and  in turn  our results of operations and financial condition 
item b unresolved staff comments none

included in this amount is  square feet of abandoned lease space 
item legal proceedings we are involved in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business  none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations  and we are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect the development and home building  sales and customer financing processes  including zoning  density  building standards and mortgage financing 
these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities 
this can delay or increase the cost of development or homebuilding 
we also are subject to a variety of local  state  federal and foreign laws and regulations concerning protection of health and the environment 
the particular environmental laws that apply to any given community vary greatly according to the community site  the site s environmental conditions and the present and former uses of the site 
these environmental laws may result in delays  may cause us to incur substantial compliance  remediation and or other costs  and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity 
the new york state department of environmental conservation the nysdec assessed a  civil penalty of which  was suspended against us and required us to perform certain measures in connection with notices of violation for allegedly failing to comply with a storm water permit at an incomplete project in the state of new york 
we have paid the  penalty  have timely completed the required measures  and have received from the nysdec a post inspection letter stating that the measures it required us to perform have been addressed 
we anticipate that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on developers and homebuilders in the future 
although we cannot predict the effect of these requirements  they could result in time consuming and expensive compliance programs and in substantial expenditures  which could cause delays and increase our cost of operations 
in addition  the continued effectiveness of permits already granted or approvals already obtained is dependent upon many factors  some of which are beyond our control  such as changes in policies  rules  and regulations and their interpretations and application

due to restrictions in our indentures for our senior and senior secured notes  we are currently prohibited from paying dividends on our preferred stock and did not make any dividend payments in fiscal   and in fiscal  we paid million of dividends on our preferred stock 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations beginning during the second half of our fiscal year ended october   the us housing market has been impacted by declining consumer confidence  increasing home foreclosure rates and large supplies of resale and new home inventories 
the result has been weakened demand for new homes  slower sales  higher than normal cancellation rates and increased price discounts and other sales incentives to attract homebuyers 
additionally  the availability of certain mortgage financing products became more constrained starting in february when the mortgage industry began to more closely scrutinize subprime  alt a  and other nonprime mortgage products  and over the past few years  many lenders have significantly tightened their underwriting standards 
the overall economy has weakened significantly and fears of further prolonged economic weakness are still present due  among other factors  to high unemployment levels  further deterioration in consumer confidence and the reduction in extensions of credit and consumer spending 
as a result  we experienced significant decreases in our revenues and gross margins during   and compared with prior years 
during and  the homebuilding market exhibited a large degree of choppiness 
signs of this choppiness can be seen in key measures  such as our gross margin  cancellation rates and total deliveries each quarter in and we continued to see declines in deliveries and revenues during fiscal  and our gross margin percentage decreased to for the year ended october  from for the year ended october   however  our contract cancellation rate of in the fourth quarter of fiscal was consistent with more normalized levels  as seen in fiscal and active selling communities remained flat at compared with the same period a year ago and net contracts per average active selling community decreased to for the year ended october  compared to in the same period in the prior year 
although we remain cautiously optimistic  several challenges such as persistently high unemployment levels  economic weakness and uncertainty  and the threat of more foreclosures continue to hinder a recovery in the housing market 
over the course of this multiple year downturn in the homebuilding market  we have recorded billion in inventory impairment and option walkaway charges from the first quarter of fiscal through fiscal we have exposure to additional impairments of our inventories  which  as of october   have a book value of million  net of million of impairments recorded on of our communities 
this includes million of cash invested in  lots under option as of october  in addition  we had million in letters of credit deposits on optioned lots as of october  we will record a write off for the amounts associated with an option if we determine it is probable we will not exercise it 
as of october   we had total investments in  and advances to  unconsolidated joint ventures of million 
each of our joint ventures assesses its inventory and other long lived assets for impairment and we separately assess our investment in joint ventures for other than temporary declines  which has resulted in total reductions in our investment in joint ventures of million from the second half of fiscal  the first period in which we had impairments on our joint ventures  through october  there were no write downs of our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures during fiscal or fiscal however  one of our joint ventures in the northeast recorded an asset impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded our proportionale share of this impairment charge as part of our share of the net loss of the venture 
we still have exposure to future write downs of our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures if conditions continue to deteriorate in the markets in which our joint ventures operate 
as the market for new homes declined  we adjusted our approach to land acquisition and construction practices and shortened our land pipeline  reduced production volumes  and balanced home price and profitability with sales pace 
we delayed and cancelled planned land purchases and renegotiated land prices and significantly reduced our total number of controlled lots owned and under option 
additionally  we significantly reduced our total number of speculative homes put into production over the past several years 
since january  however  we have begun to see more opportunities to purchase land at prices that make economic sense in light of the current sales prices and sales paces and plan to continue pursuing such land acquisitions 
new land purchases at pricing that we believe will generate appropriate investment returns and drive greater operating efficiencies are needed to return to profitability 
during fiscal  we decreased our controlled lots by  and we opened new communities 
during fiscal  we purchased approximately  lots within newly identified communities which we define as communities that were controlled subsequent to january  
in addition  we optioned approximately  lots in newly identified communities during fiscal as a result of new land purchases  in the third quarter of fiscal compared to the second quarter of fiscal  we had an increase in active selling communities in consecutive quarters 
this was the first consecutive quarter increase in active selling community count since the second quarter of fiscal this trend continued into the fourth quarter of fiscal where we had an increase in active selling communities from the third quarter of fiscal during  our active selling communities have fluctuated  but at the end of fiscal we had the same number of active selling communities as the end of fiscal we have also continued to closely evaluate and make reductions in selling  general and administrative expenses  including corporate general and administrative expenses  reducing these expenses million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due in large part to a reduction in head count at the end of fiscal from our peak in june given the persistence of these difficult market conditions  improving the efficiency of our selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to be a significant area of focus 
for the year ended october   homebuilding selling  general and administrative costs declined to million compared to the year ended october  critical accounting policies management believes that the following critical accounting policies require its most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements income recognition from home and land sales we are primarily engaged in the development  construction  marketing and sale of residential single family and multi family homes where the planned construction cycle is less than months 
for these homes  in accordance with asc  property  plant and equipment real estate sales asc  revenue is recognized when title is conveyed to the buyer  adequate initial and continuing investments have been received  and there is no continued involvement 
in situations where the buyer s financing is originated by our mortgage subsidiary and the buyer has not made an adequate initial investment or continuing investment as prescribed by asc  the profit on such sales is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a third party investor has been completed 
income recognition from mortgage loans our financial services segment originates mortgages  primarily for our homebuilding customers 
we use mandatory investor commitments and forward sales of mortgage backed securities mbs to hedge our mortgage related interest rate exposure on agency and government loans 
we elected the fair value option for our loans held for sale for mortgage loans originated subsequent to october  in accordance with asc  financial instruments  which permits us to measure our loans held for sale at fair value 
management believes that the election of the fair value option for loans held for sale improves financial reporting by mitigating volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring the fair value of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
in addition  we recognize the fair value of our rights to service a mortgage loan as revenue upon entering into an interest rate lock loan commitment with a borrower 
the fair value of these servicing rights is included in loans held for sale 
fair value of the servicing rights is determined based on values in the company s servicing sales contracts 
substantially all of the mortgage loans originated are sold within a short period of time in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released  nonrecourse basis  although the company remains liable for certain limited representations  such as fraud  and warranties related to loan sales 
mortgage investors could seek to have us buy back loans or compensate them for losses incurred on mortgages we have sold based on claims that we breached our limited representations and warranties 
we believe there continues to be an industry wide issue with the number of purchaser claims in which purchasers purport to have found inaccuracies related to the sellers representations and warranties in particular loan sale agreements 
to date  we have not made significant payments to the purchasers of our loans and we have established reserves for probable losses 
included in mortgage loans held for sale at october  is million of mortgage loans  which represent the fair value of loans that cannot currently be sold at reasonable terms in the secondary mortgage market 
these loans are serviced by a third party until such time that they can be liquidated via alternative mortgage markets  foreclosure or repayment 
inventories inventories consist of land  land development  home construction costs  capitalized interest  construction overhead and property taxes 
construction costs are accumulated during the period of construction and charged to cost of sales under specific identification methods 
land  land development  and common facility costs are allocated based on buildable acres to product types within each community  then charged to cost of sales equally based upon the number of homes to be constructed in each product type 
we record inventories in our consolidated balance sheets at cost unless the inventory is determined to be impaired  in which case the inventory is written down to its fair value 
our inventories consist of the following three components sold and unsold homes and lots under development  which includes all construction  land  capitalized interest  and land development costs related to started homes and land under development in our active communities  land and land options held for future development or sale  which includes all costs related to land in our communities in planning or mothballed communities  and consolidated inventory not owned  which includes all costs related to specific performance options  variable interest entities  and other options  which consists primarily of model homes financed with an investor and inventory related to structured lot options 
we have decided to mothball or stop development on certain communities where we have determined the current market conditions do not justify further investment at this time 
when we decide to mothball a community  the inventory is reclassified from sold and unsold homes and lots under development to land and land options held for future development or sale 
as of october   the book value of the mothballed communities was million  net of impairment charges of million 
we regularly review communities to determine if mothballing is appropriate 
during fiscal  we mothballed eight communities  re activated four communities and sold three communities which were previously mothballed 
the recoverability of inventories and other long lived assets are assessed in accordance with the provisions of asc  property  plant and equipment overall asc 
asc requires long lived assets  including inventories  held for development to be evaluated for impairment based on undiscounted future cash flows of the assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows 
as such  we evaluate inventories for impairment at the individual community level  the lowest level of discrete cash flows that we measure 
we evaluate inventories of communities under development and held for future development for impairment when indicators of potential impairment are present 
indicators of impairment include  but are not limited to  decreases in local housing market values  decreases in gross margins or sales absorption rates  decreases in net sales prices base sales price net of sales incentives  or actual or projected operating or cash flow losses 
the assessment of communities for indication of impairment is performed quarterly  primarily by completing detailed budgets for all of our communities and identifying those communities with a projected operating loss for any projected fiscal year or for the entire projected community life 
for those communities with projected losses  we estimate the remaining undiscounted future cash flows and compare those to the carrying value of the community  to determine if the carrying value of the asset is recoverable 
the projected operating profits  losses  or cash flows of each community can be significantly impacted by our estimates of the following future base selling prices  future home sales incentives  future home construction and land development costs  and future sales absorption pace and cancellation rates 
these estimates are dependent upon specific market conditions for each community 
while we consider available information to determine what we believe to be our best estimates as of the end of a quarterly reporting period  these estimates are subject to change in future reporting periods as facts and circumstances change 
local market specific conditions that may impact our estimates for a community include the intensity of competition within a market  including available home sales prices and home sales incentives offered by our competitors  including foreclosed homes where they have an impact on our ability to sell homes  the current sales absorption pace for both our communities and competitor communities  community specific attributes  such as location  availability of lots in the market  desirability and uniqueness of our community  and the size and style of homes currently being offered  potential for alternative product offerings to respond to local market conditions  changes by management in the sales strategy of the community  and current local market economic and demographic conditions and related trends and forecasts 
these and other local market specific conditions that may be present are considered by management in preparing projection assumptions for each community 
the sales objectives can differ between our communities  even within a given market 
for example  facts and circumstances in a given community may lead us to price our homes with the objective of yielding a higher sales absorption pace  while facts and circumstances in another community may lead us to price our homes to minimize deterioration in our gross margins  although it may result in a slower sales absorption pace 
in addition  the key assumptions included in our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows may be interrelated 
for example  a decrease in estimated base sales price or an increase in homes sales incentives may result in a corresponding increase in sales absorption pace 
additionally  a decrease in the average sales price of homes to be sold and closed in future reporting periods for one community that has not been generating what management believes to be an adequate sales absorption pace may impact the estimated cash flow assumptions of a nearby community 
changes in our key assumptions  including estimated construction and development costs  absorption pace and selling strategies  could materially impact future cash flow and fair value estimates 
due to the number of possible scenarios that would result from various changes in these factors  we do not believe it is possible to develop a sensitivity analysis with a level of precision that would be meaningful 
if the undiscounted cash flows are more than the carrying value of the community  then the carrying amount is recoverable  and no impairment adjustment is required 
however  if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount  then the community is deemed impaired and is written down to its fair value 
we determine the estimated fair value of each community by determining the present value of its estimated future cash flows at a discount rate commensurate with the risk of the respective community  or in limited circumstances  prices for land in recent comparable sale transactions  market analysis studies  which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land other than in a forced liquidation sale  and recent bona fide offers received from outside third parties 
our discount rates used for all impairments recorded from october  to october  range from to 
the estimated future cash flow assumptions are virtually the same for both our recoverability and fair value assessments 
should the estimates or expectations used in determining estimated cash flows or fair value  including discount rates  decrease or differ from current estimates in the future  we may be required to recognize additional impairments related to current and future communities 
the impairment of a community is allocated to each lot on a relative fair value basis 
from time to time  we write off deposits and approval  engineering and capitalized interest costs when we determine that it is no longer probable that we will exercise options to buy land in specific locations or when we redesign communities and or abandon certain engineering costs 
in deciding not to exercise a land option  we take into consideration changes in market conditions  the timing of required land takedowns  the willingness of land sellers to modify terms of the land option contract including timing of land takedowns  and the availability and best use of our capital  among other factors 
the write off is recorded in the period it is deemed probable that the optioned property will not be acquired 
in certain instances  we have been able to recover deposits and other pre acquisition costs that were previously written off 
these recoveries have not been significant in comparison to the total costs written off 
inventories held for sale  which are land parcels where we have decided not to build homes  represented million of our total inventories at october   and are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
in determining the fair value of land held for sale  management considers  among other things  prices for land in recent comparable sale transactions  market analysis studies  which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land other than in a forced liquidation sale and recent bona fide offers received from outside third parties 
insurance deductible reserves for homes delivered in fiscal and  our deductible under our general liability insurance is million per occurrence for construction defect and warranty claims 
for bodily injury claims  our deductible per occurrence in fiscal and is million up to a million limit 
our aggregate retention in is million for construction defect  warranty and bodily injury claims 
our aggregate retention in was million for construction defect and warranty claims  and million for bodily injury claims 
we do not have a deductible on our worker compensation insurance in fiscal and reserves for estimated losses for construction defects  warranty  bodily injury and worker s compensation claims have been established using the assistance of a third party actuary 
we engage a third party actuary that uses our historical warranty and construction defect data  worker compensation data  and other industry data to assist our management in estimating our unpaid claims  claim adjustment expenses and incurred but not reported claims reserves for the risks that we are assuming under the general liability and worker compensation programs 
the estimates include provisions for inflation  claims handling and legal fees 
these estimates are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products we build  claim settlement patterns  insurance industry practices  and legal interpretations  among others 
because of the high degree of judgment required in determining these estimated liability amounts  actual future costs could differ significantly from our currently estimated amounts 
land options costs incurred to obtain options to acquire improved or unimproved home sites are capitalized 
such amounts are either included as part of the purchase price if the land is acquired or charged to inventory impairments loss and land option write offs if we determine we will not exercise the option 
if the options are with variable interest entities and we are the primary beneficiary  we record the land under option on the consolidated balance sheets under consolidated inventory not owned with an offset under liabilities from inventory not owned 
the evaluation of whether or not we are the primary beneficiary can require significant judgment 
similarly  if the option obligation is to purchase under specific performance or has terms that require us to record it as financing  then we record the option on the consolidated balance sheets under consolidated inventory not owned with an offset under liabilities from inventory not owned 
in accordance with asc  consolidation overall asc  we record costs associated with other options on the consolidated balance sheets under land and land options held for future development or sale 
unconsolidated homebuilding and land development joint ventures investments in unconsolidated homebuilding and land development joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method  we recognize our proportionate share of earnings and losses earned by the joint venture upon the delivery of lots or homes to third parties 
our ownership interests in joint ventures vary but our voting interests are generally or less 
in determining whether or not we must consolidate joint ventures where we are the managing member of the joint venture  we assess whether the other partners have specific rights to overcome the presumption of control by us as the manager of the joint venture 
in most cases  the presumption is overcome because the joint venture agreements require that both partners agree on establishing the significant operating and capital decisions of the partnership  including budgets  in the ordinary course of business 
the evaluation of whether or not we control a venture can require significant judgment 
in accordance with asc  investments equity method and joint ventures overall asc  we assess our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for recoverability  and if it is determined that a loss in value of the investment below its carrying amount is other than temporary  we write down the investment to its fair value 
we evaluate our equity investments for impairment based on the joint venture s projected cash flows 
this process requires significant management judgment and estimate 
during fiscal  we wrote down certain joint venture investments by million 
there were no write downs in fiscal and post development completion and warranty costs in those instances where a development is substantially completed and sold and we have additional construction work to be incurred  an estimated liability is provided to cover the cost of such work 
in addition  we estimate and accrue warranty costs as part of cost of sales for repair costs under  per occurrence to homes  community amenities and land development infrastructure 
in addition  we accrue for warranty costs over  per occurrence as part of our general liability insurance deductible expensed as selling  general  and administrative costs 
warranty accruals require our management to make significant estimates about the cost of future claims 
both of these liabilities are recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between amounts recorded for financial reporting and for income tax purposes 
if the combination of future years income or loss combined with the reversal of the timing differences results in a loss  such losses can be carried back to prior years or carried forward to future years to recover the deferred tax assets 
in accordance with asc  income taxes overall asc  we evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required 
asc requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
see total taxes below under results of operations for further discussion of the valuation allowances 
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with asc  and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a liability that is materially different from our current estimate 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
there have been no accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented that we believe will materially impact our financial statements 
capital resources and liquidity our operations consist primarily of residential housing development and sales in the northeast new jersey  pennsylvania  the midwest illinois  minnesota  ohio  the mid atlantic delaware  maryland  virginia  west virginia  washington dc  the southeast florida  georgia  north carolina  south carolina  the southwest arizona  texas  and the west california 
in addition  we provide certain financial services to our homebuilding customers 
we have historically funded our homebuilding and financial services operations with cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under our bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt and equity securities 
in light of the challenging homebuilding market conditions we have been experiencing over the past few years  we had been operating with a primary focus to generate cash flows from operations through reductions in assets during fiscal  and the generation of cash flow  together with debt repurchases and exchanges at prices below par  allowed us to reduce net debt debt less cash over these years 
in fiscal and fiscal  we saw more opportunities to purchase land at prices that make economic sense given current home sales prices and sales paces 
as such  in fiscal and  we have acquired new land at higher levels than in the previous few years 
as a result  our net debt increased during the last half of and in fiscal our homebuilding cash balance at october  decreased by million from october  the significant uses of cash during the year were primarily due to spending approximately million on land and land development and million  including million for accrued interest  for the repurchase of certain of our senior notes 
these items were partially offset by the following significant sources of cash million of proceeds from the february issuances of class a common stock  tangible equity units and senior notes  of which approximately million was used to repurchase or redeem certain of our senior and senior subordinated notes  net proceeds of million during the first half of fiscal for land we previously owned and sold to a new joint venture that we entered into during the first quarter of fiscal  million from income tax refunds and million of restricted cash that became unrestricted as the letters of credit the cash collateralized were released during fiscal  with the remaining change in cash coming from normal operations 
our cash uses during fiscal and were for operating expenses  land purchases  land deposits  land development  construction spending  state income taxes  interest payments and investments in joint ventures 
we provided for our cash requirements from available cash on hand  issuances of new debt and equity securities  housing and land sales  financial service revenues  federal income tax refunds and other revenues 
we believe that these sources of cash will be sufficient through fiscal to finance our working capital requirements and other needs  despite continued declines in total revenues  the termination of our revolving credit facility in fiscal and the collateralization with cash in segregated accounts to support certain of our letters of credit 
we may also enter into land sale agreements or joint ventures to generate cash from our existing balance sheet 
due to a change in tax legislation that became effective on november   we were able to carryback our net operating loss five years to previously profitable years 
as a result  we received a million federal income tax cash refund during our second quarter of fiscal and we received the remaining million of the refund in the first quarter of fiscal in addition  in february  we completed several capital markets transactions  which resulted in aggregate net proceeds of approximately million  approximately million of which were used to repurchase certain of our senior and senior subordinated notes in tender offers for such notes and million of which were used to redeem  on march   all such notes not tendered in the tender offers 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in may  we issued an additional million of our senior secured notes due the net proceeds from the offering were approximately million which  together with cash on hand  were used to fund the redemption on june   of the remaining million outstanding of our senior secured notes due and the remaining million outstanding of our senior secured notes due during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed a number of open market repurchases of our senior notes at a discount 
these included million principal amount of senior notes due  and million principal amount of senior notes due the aggregate purchase price for these repurchases was million  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
these repurchases resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of million  net of the write off of unamortized discounts and fees 
the gains from the repurchases are included in the consolidated statement of operations as gain on extinguishment of debt 
our net income loss historically does not approximate cash flow from operating activities 
the difference between net income loss and cash flow from operating activities is primarily caused by changes in inventory levels together with changes in receivables  prepaid and other assets  interest and other accrued liabilities  deferred income taxes  accounts payable  mortgage loans and liabilities  and noncash charges relating to depreciation  amortization of computer software costs  stock compensation awards and impairment losses for inventory 
when we are expanding our operations  inventory levels  prepaids  and other assets increase causing cash flow from operating activities to decrease 
certain liabilities also increase as operations expand and partially offset the negative effect on cash flow from operations caused by the increase in inventory levels  prepaids and other assets 
similarly  as our mortgage operations expand  net income from these operations increases  but for cash flow purposes net income is offset by the net change in mortgage assets and liabilities 
the opposite is true as our investment in new land purchases and development of new communities decrease  which is what happened during the last half of fiscal through fiscal  allowing us to generate positive cash flow from operations during this period 
since the latter part of fiscal  as a result of the new land purchases and land development we have used cash in operations as we add new communities 
looking forward  given the depressed housing market  it will become more difficult to generate positive cash flow from operations until we return to profitability 
however  we will continue to make adjustments to our structure and our business plans in order to maximize our liquidity while also taking steps to return to profitability  including through land acquisitions 
we continue to focus on maximizing cash flow by limiting our investment in currently owned communities that we believe will not generate positive cash flow in the near term  and by seeking to identify and purchase new land parcels generating acceptable returns based on our underwriting standards and positive cash flow 
on july   our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program to purchase up to million shares of class a common stock 
as of october   million shares of class a common stock have been purchased under this program see part ii  item for information on equity purchases 
we did not buy back any shares under this program during fiscal  or on july   we issued  shares of series a preferred stock  with a liquidation preference of  dividends on the series a preferred stock are not cumulative and are payable at an annual rate of 
the series a preferred stock is not convertible into the company s common stock and is redeemable in whole or in part at our option at the liquidation preference of the shares beginning on the fifth anniversary of their issuance 
the series a preferred stock is traded as depositary shares  with each depositary share representing th of a share of series a preferred stock 
the depositary shares are listed on the nasdaq global market under the symbol hovnp 
in fiscal   and  we did not make any dividend payments on the series a preferred stock as a result of covenant restrictions in our debt instruments 
we anticipate that we will continue to be restricted from paying dividends  which are not cumulative  for the foreseeable future

in addition  the senior secured notes due and the senior secured notes due are guaranteed by the secured group 
members of the secured group do not guarantee k 
hovnanian other indebtedness 
the indentures governing the notes do not contain any financial maintenance covenants  but do contain restrictive covenants that limit  among other things  the company s ability and that of certain of its subsidiaries  including k 
hovnanian  to incur additional indebtedness other than certain permitted indebtedness  refinancing indebtedness and non recourse indebtedness  pay dividends and make distributions on common and preferred stock  repurchase senior and senior subordinated notes with respect to the senior secured first lien notes indenture  make other restricted payments  make investments  sell certain assets  incur liens  consolidate  merge  sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all assets and enter into certain transactions with affiliates

as of october   we believe we were in compliance with the covenants of the indentures governing our outstanding notes

we also continue to evaluate our capital structure and may also continue to make debt purchases and or exchanges from time to time through tender offers  open market purchases  private transactions  or otherwise or seek to raise additional debt or equity capital  depending on market conditions and covenant restrictions 
if our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the indentures governing our senior secured and senior notes  is less than to  we are restricted from making certain payments  including dividends  and from incurring indebtedness other than certain permitted indebtedness  refinancing indebtedness  and non recourse indebtedness 
as a result of this restriction  we are currently restricted from paying dividends  which are not cumulative  on our series a preferred stock 
if current market trends continue or worsen  we will continue to be restricted from paying dividends for the foreseeable future 
our inability to pay dividends is in accordance with covenant restrictions and will not result in a default under our bond indentures or otherwise affect compliance with any of the covenants contained in the bond indentures 
in connection with the issuance of our senior secured notes due in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we terminated our revolving credit facility and refinanced the borrowing capacity thereunder 
also in connection with the refinancing  we entered into certain stand alone cash collateralized letter of credit agreements and facilities under which there were a total of million and million of letters of credit outstanding as of october  and october   respectively 
these agreements and facilities require us to maintain specified amounts of cash as collateral in segregated accounts to support the letters of credit issued thereunder  which will affect the amount of cash we have available for other uses 
as of october  and october   the amount of cash collateral in these segregated accounts was million and million  respectively  which is reflected in restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets

downgrades in our credit ratings do not accelerate the scheduled maturity dates of our debt or affect the interest rates charged on any of our debt issues or our debt covenant requirements or cause any other operating issue 
a potential risk from negative changes in our credit ratings is that they may make it more difficult or costly for us to access capital 
however  due to our available cash resources  the downgrades and revisions to our credit ratings in discussed above have not impacted management s operating plans  or our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
total inventory  excluding consolidated inventory not owned  increased million during the year ended october  total inventory  excluding consolidated inventory not owned  increased in the mid atlantic million  in the midwest million  in the southeast million and in the southwest million 
these increases were offset by decreases in the northeast of million and the west of million 
during fiscal  we incurred million in impairments  the majority of which related to three properties that were transitioned from inventory held for development to held for sale  five communities in the northeast that have had meaningful price reductions in order to maintain reasonable sales pace  and five communities in the west where we continue to see pricing pressure 
in addition  we wrote off costs in the amount of million during fiscal related to land options that expired or that we terminated  as the communities forecasted profitability was not projected to produce adequate returns on investment commensurate with the risk 
despite these write downs and inventory reductions due to deliveries  as well as the sale of certain inventory to a new joint venture during the first two quarters of fiscal  total inventory increased million  excluding consolidated inventory not owned  because we spent approximately million on land purchases and land development during fiscal also contributing to the increase in inventory during the period was the consolidation of a joint venture in the first quarter of fiscal  whereby our partner in a land development joint venture transferred its interest in the venture to us 
in the last two years  we have been able to acquire new land parcels at prices that we believe will generate reasonable returns under current homebuilding market conditions 
there can be no assurances that this trend will continue in the near term 
substantially all homes under construction or completed and included in inventory at october  are expected to be closed during the next months 
most inventory completed or under development was is partially financed through debt and equity issuances 
the total inventory increase discussed above excluded the decrease in consolidated inventory not owned of million consisting of specific performance options  and options with variable interest entities  and other options that were added to our balance sheet in accordance with asc  debt product financing arrangements  asc  leases sales leaseback transactions  and variable interest entities in accordance with asc see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on asc specific performance options inventory decreased million during fiscal this decrease was primarily due to lot take downs in the northeast  southwest and west during the period 
variable interest entity options inventory decreased million due to the revised guidance by the fasb for determining which entity is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of adoption of this revised guidance  we deconsolidated land previously attributed to variable interest entities and reported such land as inventory not owned 
other options inventory decreased million for fiscal other options consist of inventory financed via a model home program 
model home inventory financed through the model lease program decreased million because we have terminated the use of models in certain communities where models were no longer needed and also terminated the option to purchase those models 
we usually option property for development prior to acquisition 
by optioning property  we are only subject to the loss of the cost of the option and predevelopment costs if we choose not to exercise the option 
as a result  our commitment for major land acquisitions is reduced 
the costs associated with optioned properties are included in land and land options held for future development or sale inventory 
also included in land and land options held for future development or sale inventory are amounts associated with inventory in mothballed communities 
we mothball or stop development on certain communities when we determine the current performance does not justify further investment at this time 
that is  we believe we will generate higher returns if we decide against spending money to improve land today and save the raw land until such times as the markets improve 
as of october   we have mothballed land in communities 
the book value associated with these communities at october  was million  net of impairment charges of million 
we continually review communities to determine if mothballing is appropriate 
during fiscal  we mothballed eight communities  re activated four communities and sold three communities which were previously mothballed 
our inventory representing land and land options held for future development or sale at october   on the consolidated balance sheets  decreased by million compared to october  the decrease is due to additional impairments taken primarily in the northeast and the west in fiscal  offset by an increase due to the acquisition of new land in all segments as land prices became more attractive during fiscal the following table summarizes home sites included in our total residential real estate 
the decrease in total home sites available in compared to is attributable to the delivery of homes during fiscal  partially offset by new lots controlled via option or purchase during total home sites contracted not delivered remaining home sites available october  northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west consolidated total unconsolidated joint ventures total including unconsolidated joint ventures owned optioned construction to permanent financing lots consolidated total lots controlled by unconsolidated joint ventures total including unconsolidated joint ventures october  northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west consolidated total unconsolidated joint ventures total including unconsolidated joint ventures owned optioned construction to permanent financing lots consolidated total lots controlled by unconsolidated joint ventures total including unconsolidated joint ventures the following table summarizes our started or completed unsold homes and models  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures  in active and substantially completed communities october  october  unsold homes models total unsold homes models total northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west total started or completed unsold homes and models per active selling communities active selling communities  which are communities that are open for sale with or more home sites available  were at both october   and total unsold homes at october  is virtually unchanged compared to the prior year 
investments in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures increased million during the fiscal year ended october  the increase is primarily due to an investment in a new joint venture during  to which we contributed property previously reflected in consolidated inventory  as well as increases resulting from additional investments in joint ventures offset by a decrease in our investment in a joint venture in the northeast  due to a write down of the joint venture s assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal as of october   we had investments in nine homebuilding joint ventures and three land development joint ventures 
other than guarantees limited only to performance and completion of development  environmental warranties and indemnification and standard indemnification for fraud and misrepresentation and other similar actions  including a voluntary bankruptcy filing  we have no guarantees associated with unconsolidated joint ventures 
receivables  deposits and notes decreased million since october  to million at october  the decrease is due to a decrease in receivables for home closings as a result of cash in transit from various title companies at the end of the respective periods  as well as reimbursements from our insurance carriers for certain warranty claims 
also contributing to the decrease is the receipt of final payment of a note in our southwest segment in conjunction with the acquisition of the property that collateralized the note 
property  plant and equipment decreased million during the twelve months ended october  primarily due to depreciation and a small amount of disposals  which were offset by minor additions for leasehold improvements during the period 
prepaid expenses and other assets were as follows as of in thousands october  october  dollar change prepaid insurance prepaid project costs senior residential rental properties other prepaids other assets total prepaid insurance increased due to the timing of payments for insurance premium costs and related amortization of these costs  as they are amortized over the life of the associated insurance policy  which can be one to three years 
prepaid project costs consist of community specific expenditures that are used over the life of the community 
such prepaids are expensed as homes are delivered 
the decrease in prepaid project costs is primarily due to costs that were written off in the fourth quarter of fiscal  related to the sale of a community in the northeast 
other prepaids decreased mainly due to the amortization of prepaid debt costs 
also contributing to the decrease were debt repurchases during fiscal  which resulted in the write off of portions of the associated prepaid debt costs 
financial services mortgage loans held for sale consist primarily of residential mortgages receivable held for sale of which million and million at october  and october   respectively  were being temporarily warehoused and are awaiting sale in the secondary mortgage market 
also included mortgage loans held for sale are residential mortgages receivable held for sale of million and million at october  and october   respectively  which represent loans that cannot currently be sold at reasonable terms in the secondary mortgage market 
we may incur losses with respect to mortgages that were previously sold that are delinquent  but only to the extent the losses are not covered by mortgage insurance or resale value of the house 
historically  we have incurred minimal credit losses 
the decrease in mortgage loans held for sale at october  compared to october   is the direct result of a decrease in the volume of loans originated during the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal nonrecourse land mortgages were million at october  and at october  the increase is primarily due to new purchase money mortgages for land acquisitions in the northeast  mid atlantic and west segments during fiscal  offset by payments on mortgages in the southwest and west 
accounts payable and other liabilities are as follows as of in thousands october  october  dollar change accounts payable reserves accrued expenses accrued compensation other liabilities total the decrease in reserves is primarily due to a consolidation of a joint venture that resulted from our partner in a land development joint venture transferring its interest in the venture to us  offset by an increase in our general liability reserves based on recent actuarial estimates 
the slight decrease in accrued expenses is primarily due to timing of property tax and advertising accruals and amortization of abandoned lease space accruals 
other liabilities decreased primarily due to a reduction in the accrual for self insured medical claims  based on recent claim data  along with a decrease related to the timing of payments made on a short term note 
customer deposits increased to million at october  from million at october  the increase was primarily due to lower contracts in backlog and the impact of the use of a third party escrow agent to hold deposits in the northeast 
mortgage warehouse line of credit under our chase master repurchase agreement decreased million from million at october   to million at october  the decrease is due to the decrease in mortgage loans held for sale from october  to october  and because the maximum borrowing amount available under the chase master repurchase agreement at october  is million which is lower than the prior year maximum borrowing amount 
liabilities from inventory not owned decreased million to million at october  from million at october  because inventory not owned decreased as discussed previously 
income taxes payable of million at october  increased million in the twelve months ended october  to million primarily due to the settlement of certain matters with the relevant tax authorities and the related receipt of refund amounts that had been accrued in the prior fiscal year

average price per home also decreased to  for from  in and from  in the fluctuations in average prices are a result of the geographic and community mix of our deliveries rather than price increases or decreases in individual communities 
for example  for the year ended october   of our deliveries came from our southwest segment  compared to for the same period last year 
this segment had an average selling price below the company average for both periods

quarterly housing revenues and net sales contracts by segment  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures  for the years ending october   and are set forth below quarter ended in thousands october  july  april  january  housing revenues northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west consolidated total sales contracts net of cancellations northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west consolidated total quarter ended in thousands october  july  april  january  housing revenues northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west consolidated total sales contracts net of cancellations northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west consolidated total quarter ended in thousands october  july  april  january  housing revenues northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west consolidated total sales contracts net of cancellations northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west consolidated total our reported level of sales contracts net of cancellations has been impacted by a slowdown in the pace of sales in all of the company s segments  due to continued weak market conditions and tighter mortgage loan underwriting criteria 
contracts per average active selling community in were compared to fiscal of  demonstrating a decrease in sales pace 
cancellation rates represent the number of cancelled contracts in the quarter divided by the number of gross sales contracts executed in the quarter 
for comparison  the following are historical cancellation rates  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures 
quarter first second third fourth another common and meaningful way to analyze our cancellation trends is to compare the number of contract cancellations as a percentage of the beginning backlog 
the following table provides this historical comparison  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures 
quarter first second third fourth historically  most cancellations occur within the legal rescission period  which varies by state but is generally less than two weeks after the signing of the contract 
cancellations also occur as a result of a buyer s failure to qualify for a mortgage  which generally occurs during the first few weeks after signing 
however  beginning in fiscal year  we began experiencing higher than normal numbers of cancellations later in the construction process 
these cancellations are related primarily to falling prices  sometimes due to new discounts offered by us and other builders  leading the buyer to lose confidence in their contract price and due to tighter mortgage underwriting criteria leading to some customers inability to be approved for a mortgage loan 
in some cases  the buyer will walk away from a significant nonrefundable deposit that we recognize as other revenues 
while our cancellation rate based on gross sales contracts since the second quarter of fiscal has been lower than it has been for several years  and closer to more normalized levels  it is difficult to predict if this trend will continue 
also  the cancellation rate as a percentage of beginning backlog is closer to more normalized levels and down from a higher percentage in the fourth quarter of fiscal an important indicator of our future results is recently signed contracts and our home contract backlog for future deliveries 
our consolidated contract backlog  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures  using base sales prices by segment is set forth below dollars in thousands october  october  october  northeast total contract backlog number of homes mid atlantic total contract backlog number of homes midwest total contract backlog number of homes southeast total contract backlog number of homes southwest total contract backlog number of homes west total contract backlog number of homes totals total consolidated contract backlog number of homes our net contracts for the full years of fiscal and  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures  declined and  respectively  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the rate of decline in both net contracts and deliveries decreased from fiscal to fiscal  resulting in an increase in our backlog at october  from october  in the month of november  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures  we signed an additional net contracts amounting to million in contract value 
total cost of sales on our consolidated statements of operations includes expenses for consolidated housing and land and lot sales  including inventory impairment loss and land option write offs defined as land charges in the tables below 
a breakout of such expenses for housing sales and housing gross margin is set forth below year ended dollars in thousands october  october  october  sale of homes cost of sales  net of impairment reversals and excluding interest expense homebuilding gross margin  before cost of sales interest expense and land charges cost of sales interest expense  excluding land sales interest expense homebuilding gross margin  after cost of sales interest expense  before land charges land charges homebuilding gross margin  after cost of sales interest expense and land charges gross margin percentage  before cost of sales interest expense and land charges gross margin percentage  after cost of sales interest expense  before land charges gross margin percentage after cost of sales interest expense and land charges cost of sales expenses as a percentage of consolidated home sales revenues are presented below year ended october  october  october  sale of homes cost of sales  net of impairment reversals and excluding interest housing  land and development costs commissions financing concessions overheads total cost of sales  before interest expense and land charges gross margin percentage  before cost of sales interest expense and land charges cost of sales interest gross margin percentage  after cost of sales interest expense and before land charges we sell a variety of home types in various communities  each yielding a different gross margin 
as a result  depending on the mix of communities delivering homes  consolidated gross margin may fluctuate up or down 
total homebuilding gross margins  before interest expense and land impairment and option write off charges decreased to for the year ended october  compared to for the same period last year 
the declining pace of sales in our markets in   and has led to intense competition in many of our specific community locations 
in order to attempt to maintain a reasonable pace of absorption  we have increased incentives  reduced lot location premiums  as well as lowered some base prices  all of which have impacted our margins significantly and resulted in significant inventory impairments 
however  the rate of the decline has slowed in most of our segments and in a few locations we have been able to raise prices without adversely impacting sales pace 
in addition  during fiscal we delivered the final homes in some older communities where margins were lower and in fiscal and fiscal we have increased the number of deliveries from new communities where we have acquired the land at more reasonable prices  resulting in higher gross margins 
also  we have recorded impairment reversals as homes previously impaired are delivered 
this has resulted in the improvement in our gross margins before cost of sales interest and land charges in fiscal from fiscal reflected as inventory impairment loss and land option write offs in cost of sales land charges  we have written off or written down certain inventories totaling million  million  and million during the years ended october    and  respectively  to their estimated fair value 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for an additional discussion 
during the years ended october    and  we wrote off residential land options and approval and engineering costs amounting to million  million  and million  respectively  which are included in the total write offs mentioned above 
when a community is redesigned or abandoned  engineering costs are written off 
option  approval and engineering costs are written off when a community s pro forma profitability is not projected to produce adequate returns on the investment commensurate with the risk and we believe it is probable we will cancel the option 
such write offs were located in all of our segments 
the inventory impairments amounting to million  million  and million for the years ending october   and  respectively  were incurred because of continued downward pressure on prices in order to maintain sales pace in many of our markets 
in and  the majority of the impairments were in the northeast and west segments 
impairments in the northeast were primarily due to increased weakness in the market  primarily in northern new jersey and communities now classified as held for sale or sold and thus adjusted to fair value 
in the west  where we have significant competition from foreclosures  we have had to continue to reduce prices in order to maintain sales pace 
this is especially true in some of the more fringe markets in our west segment 
inventory impairments were lower than they have been in several years  as we have begun to see some stabilization in prices and sales pace in some of our segments 
it is difficult to predict if this trend will continue  and should it become necessary to further lower prices  or should the estimates or expectations used in determining estimated cash flows or fair value decrease or differ from current estimates in the future  we may need to recognize additional impairments 
below is a break down of our lot option walk aways and impairments by segment for fiscal in  in total  we walked away from of all the lots we controlled under option contracts 
the remaining of our option lots are in communities that remain economically feasible  including a substantial number that were successfully renegotiated in the past few years 
the following table represents lot option walk aways by segment for the year ended october  in millions dollar amount of walk away number of walk away lots of walk away lots total option lots walk away lots as a of total option lots northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west total includes lots optioned at october  and lots optioned that the company walked away from in the year ended october  the following table represents impairments by segment for the year ended october  in millions dollar amount of impairment of impairments pre impairment value of pre impairment value northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west total homebuilding selling  general  and administrative sga expenses decreased to million for the year ended october   and decreased to million for the year ended october  from million for the year ended october  these decreases in sga expenses are the result of reduced costs through headcount reduction  administrative consolidation and other cost saving measures 
land sales and other revenues land sales and other revenues consist primarily of land and lot sales 
a breakout of land and lot sales is set forth below year ended in thousands october  october  october  land and lot sales cost of sales  net of impairment reversals and excluding interest land and lot sales gross margin  excluding interest land sales interest expense land and lot sales gross margin  including interest land sales are ancillary to our residential homebuilding operations and are expected to continue in the future but may significantly fluctuate up or down 
profits from land sales for the year ended october  were less than for the year ended october  although we budget land sales  they are often dependent upon receiving approvals and entitlements  the timing of which can be uncertain 
as a result  projecting the amount and timing of land sales is difficult 
there were several larger land sales in the current year compared to only a few in the prior year  which resulted in the significant increase of land sales revenue 
land sales and other revenues increased million and decreased million for the years ended october  and october   respectively 
other revenues include income from contract cancellations  where the deposit has been forfeited due to contract terminations  interest income  cash discounts  buyer walk aways and miscellaneous one time receipts 
in fiscal  the primary reason for the increase in other revenue by million was due to the payoff of a note receivable owed to us from which we recognized interest income 
in fiscal  the primary reason for the decrease in other revenue by million was a reduction in interest income due to lower excess cash in interest bearing accounts as well as lower interest rates in compared to in addition  as cancellation rates have come down as compared to the prior year  income from forfeited customer deposits has declined

in addition  there was a decrease of gross margin percentage before interest expense

selling  general and administrative costs were down million due primarily to decreased salaries from headcount reductions and other overhead cost savings 
in addition  gross margin before interest expense had a significant increase in  as we begin to stabilize prices in this market and we see the benefit of impairment reserve reversals as homes are delivered 
financial services financial services consist primarily of originating mortgages from our homebuyers  selling such mortgages in the secondary market  and title insurance activities 
we use mandatory investor commitments and forward sales of mortgage backed securities mbs to hedge our mortgage related interest rate exposure on agency and government loans 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk 
credit risk associated with mbs forward commitments and loan sales transactions is managed by limiting our counterparties to investment banks  federally regulated bank affiliates and other investors meeting our credit standards 
our risk  in the event of default by the purchaser  is the difference between the contract price and fair value of the mbs forward commitments 
in an effort to reduce our exposure to the marketability and disposal of nonagency and nongovernmental loans  including alt a fico scores below and depending on credit criteria and sub prime loans fico scores below and depending on credit criteria  we no longer originate alt a or sub prime loans 
as alt a and sub prime originations were eliminated  we have seen an increase in our level of federal housing administration and veterans administration fha va loan origination from levels that historically prevailed prior to the economic downturn 
for the years ended october   and  fha va loans represented   and  respectively  of our total loans 
profits and losses relating to the sale of mortgage loans are recognized when legal control passes to the buyer of the mortgage and the sales price is collected 
during the years ended october    and  financial services provided an million  million  and million pretax profit  respectively 
in fiscal  financial services revenue decreased million to million due to the decrease in the number of mortgage settlements and a decrease in the average loan amount 
in fiscal  financial services revenue decreased million to million due to a decrease in the number of mortgage settlements offset by a slight increase in the average loan amount 
in fiscal  we recorded expense of million for abandoned lease space  which contributed to the increase in pretax profit from october  to october   as this expense did not recur in in the market areas served by our wholly owned mortgage banking subsidiaries  approximately   and of our noncash homebuyers obtained mortgages originated by these subsidiaries during the years ended october    and  respectively 
servicing rights on new mortgages originated by us will be sold with the loans 
corporate general and administrative corporate general and administrative expenses include the operations at our headquarters in red bank  new jersey 
these expenses include payroll  stock compensation  facility and other costs associated with our executive offices  information services  human resources  corporate accounting  training  treasury  process redesign  internal audit  construction services  and administration of insurance  quality  and safety 
corporate general and administrative expenses declined million for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october   and declined million for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  the decrease in expenses in fiscal was due to a combination of a decrease in depreciation expense from capitalized software costs becoming fully depreciated  coupled with no new significant additions of depreciable assets  the benefit in the reduction as an accrual for self insured medical claims  based on recent claim data  and a continued effort to tighten variable spending and reduce outside service costs 
the reduction in expenses in fiscal was primarily due to the expense of million taken in fiscal for the cancellation of stock options  which did not recur in fiscal during fiscal  the chief executive officer  chief financial officer  each of the nonexecutive members of the board of directors and certain other senior executives of the company consented to the cancellation of certain of their options with the full understanding that the company made no commitment to provide them with any other form of consideration in respect of the cancelled options in order to reduce a portion of the equity reserve overhang under the company s equity compensation plans represented by the number of shares of the company s common stock remaining available for future issuance under such plans including shares that may be issued upon the exercise or vesting of outstanding options and other rights 
the million charge to operations was a noncash charge that increased paid in capital by the same amount 
excluding this option cancellation expense  corporate  general and administrative expenses decreased million for the year ended october  compared to october  this decrease is primarily due to reduced salaries resulting from headcount reduction and continued tightening of variable spending 
other interest other interest decreased million to million for the year ended october  for fiscal  other interest increased million to million 
our assets that qualify for interest capitalization inventory under development are less than our debt  and therefore a portion of interest not covered by qualifying assets must be directly expensed 
as our inventory balances for qualifying assets have increased and our debt has decreased  the amount of interest required to be directly expensed has slightly decreased 
other operations other operations consist primarily of miscellaneous residential housing operations expenses  senior rental residential property operations  rent expense for commercial office space  amortization of prepaid bond fees  minority interest relating to consolidated joint ventures  and corporate owned life insurance 
compared to the previous year  other operations decreased million to million for the year ended october   and decreased million to million for the year ended october  the decrease in other operations from october  to october  is primarily due to the write off in of costs associated with an investment that we decided not to pursue and the write off of old receivables in the prior year that were deemed uncollectible 
the decrease in other operations from october  to october  is primarily due to an million accrual for abandoned commercial lease space that occurred in fiscal and did not recur in fiscal this expense was offset by income of million due to the reversal of an accrual related to litigation in the fourth quarter of fiscal  when it was determined that payment was no longer probable 
gain on extinguishment of debt during the year ended october   our gain on extinguishment of debt was million compared to million for the year ended october  in february of  we purchased a portion of our subordinated notes million face for million cash in a tender offer  and redeemed early the remainder of those notes million in debt for million cash 
in both transactions  we paid a premium  incurred fees  and wrote off discounts and prepaid costs that we were amortizing over the term of notes 
on june   we redeemed early the remainder of certain of our senior secured notes 
these transactions resulted in a loss of million during the year ended october  offsetting this loss was a gain of million on open market repurchases during the fourth quarter of fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we repurchased in the open market a total of million principal amount of various issues of our unsecured senior notes due through for an aggregate purchase price of million  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the net gain of million for the year ended october   is net of the write offs of unamortized discounts and fees  related to these purchases  which represents the difference between the aggregate principal amounts of the notes purchased and the total purchase price 
during the year ended october   we repurchased in the open market a total of million principal amount of various issues of our unsecured senior and senior subordinated notes due through for an aggregate purchase price of million  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
we recognized a gain of million net of the write off of unamortized discounts and fees related to these purchases  which represents the difference between the aggregate principal amounts of the notes purchased and the total purchase price 
during the year ended october   we repurchased in the open market a total of million principal amount of various issues of our unsecured senior and senior subordinated notes due through for an aggregate purchase price of million  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
we recognized a gain of million net of the write off of unamortized discounts and fees  related to these purchases  which represents the difference between the aggregate principal amounts of the notes purchased and the total purchase price 
in addition  on december   we exchanged a total of million principal amount of various issues of our unsecured senior notes due through for million in senior secured notes due this exchange resulted in a recognized gain of million 
during the year ended october   we completed cash tender offers whereby we purchased an aggregate of approximately million principal amount of various issues of our secured and unsecured senior and senior subordinated notes due through for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  plus accrued unpaid interest 
as a result of the tender offers we recognized a gain of million in the third quarter of fiscal  net of the write off of unamortized discounts and fees and a loss of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the fourth quarter loss was offset by gains from open market repurchases resulting in a net loss of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal we may continue to make additional debt purchases and or exchanges through tender offers  open market purchases  private transactions or otherwise from time to time depending on market conditions and covenant restrictions 
income loss from unconsolidated joint ventures income loss from unconsolidated joint ventures consists of our share of the earnings or losses of the joint ventures 
the income decreased million to a loss of million for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  the loss is mainly due to the costs incurred with the start up of a new joint venture in fiscal  as well as our share of the losses from inventory impairment on one of our joint ventures 
the loss decreased million to income of million for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  the income in was mainly due to two joint ventures  both of which began in late  that delivered homes and reported profits during fiscal we also recognized income from one of our land development joint ventures that sold a parcel of land for a profit during fiscal in addition  in  we wrote down our investment in one of our joint ventures where the full investment was determined to be impaired  as well as for our share of the losses from inventory impairments from two other joint ventures 
total taxes the total income tax benefit was million for the year ended october  primarily due to a decrease in tax reserves for uncertain tax positions 
for the year ended october   the total income tax benefit was million primarily due to the benefit recognized for a federal net operating loss carryback 
on november   president obama signed the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of  under which the company was able to carryback its net operating loss to previously profitable years that were not available for carryback prior to the new tax legislation 
we recorded the impact of the carryback of million in the three months ended january  we received million in the second quarter of fiscal and the remaining million in the three months ended january  deferred federal and state income tax assets primarily represent the deferred tax benefits arising from temporary differences between book and tax income which will be recognized in future years as an offset against future taxable income 
if the combination of future years income or loss and the reversal of the timing differences results in a loss  such losses can be carried forward to future years to recover the deferred tax assets 
in accordance with asc  we evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required 
asc requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
given the continued downturn in the homebuilding industry during  and  resulting in additional inventory and intangible impairments  we are in a three year cumulative loss position as of october  according to asc  a three year cumulative loss is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable 
our valuation allowance for current and deferred taxes amounted to million and million at october  and october   respectively 
the valuation allowance increased during the twelve months ended october  primarily due to additional reserves recorded for the federal and state tax benefits related to the losses incurred during the period 
off balance sheet financing in the ordinary course of business  we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or lots for the construction of homes 
lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with a minimal capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development 
at october   we had million in option deposits in cash and letters of credit to purchase land and lots with a total purchase price of million 
our liability is generally limited to forfeiture of the nonrefundable deposits  letters of credit and other nonrefundable amounts incurred 
we have no material third party guarantees 
however  million of the million in land and lot option purchase contracts contain specific performance clauses which require us to purchase the land or lots upon satisfaction of certain requirements by both the sellers and the company 
therefore  this specific performance obligation of million  which is the purchase price for these lots net of cash deposits already paid  is recorded on the balance sheet in liabilities from inventory not owned 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our aggregate contractual commitments at october  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total represents our senior secured  senior  and amortizing notes 
other notes payable and related interest payments for the life of the debt of million 
interest on variable rate obligations is based on rates effective as of october  represents obligations under option contracts with specific performance provisions  net of cash deposits 
total contractual obligations exclude our accrual for uncertain tax positions recorded for financial reporting purposes as of october  because we were unable to make reasonable estimates as to the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
does not include the mortgage warehouse line of credit made under our chase master repurchase agreement 
during november  we exchanged certain senior notes  and also repurchased in the open market certain senior notes 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
we had outstanding letters of credit and performance bonds of approximately million and million  respectively  at october   related principally to our obligations to local governments to construct roads and other improvements in various developments 
we do not believe that any such letters of credit or bonds are likely to be drawn upon 
inflation inflation has a long term effect  because increasing costs of land  materials  and labor result in increasing sale prices of our homes 
in general  these price increases have been commensurate with the general rate of inflation in our housing markets and have not had a significant adverse effect on the sale of our homes 
a significant risk faced by the housing industry generally is that rising house construction costs  including land and interest costs  will substantially outpace increases in the income of potential purchasers 
inflation has a lesser short term effect  because we generally negotiate fixed price contracts with many  but not all  of our subcontractors and material suppliers for the construction of our homes 
these prices usually are applicable for a specified number of residential buildings or for a time period of between three to twelve months 
construction costs for residential buildings represent approximately of our homebuilding cost of sales
