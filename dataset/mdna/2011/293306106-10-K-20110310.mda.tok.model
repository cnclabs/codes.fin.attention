note to the financial statements contain segment information 
overview results of operations englobal is currently facing a number of challenges 
due to the current economic conditions and to the reluctance on the part of our customers to undertake new projects domestically  fewer projects are available and customers are seeking to renegotiate rates on existing contracts 
while we are seeing an increase in proposal activity  available projects are relatively small and pricing is extremely competitive 
in response to these conditions  we are increasing our marketing efforts in part by expanding our marketing staff 
however  even with heightened marketing activity  these factors adversely impact our profitability  backlog and liquidity 
we are in the process of renegotiating our credit facility with wells fargo bank but there is no assurance that we will be able to do so 
in addition  collection of receivables has become more challenging as the economic sector we serve has continued to see only modest improvement 
management believes that past lay offs and the reduction in employee benefits for remaining employees  necessitated by the adverse impact of industry conditions on the company operations  have negatively affected employee morale and retention 
in the face of these issues  we are evaluating the possible reinstatement of certain employee benefits 
in addition  management has been focusing on the need to maintain an internal culture and external reputation for providing high quality  responsive and cost effective work 
under the leadership of our new ceo  we are in the process of evaluating and making changes in our internal management operations to address these issues 
while management changes such as those in process can be disruptive in the short term  we believe the long term impact of the changes will be favorable 
we are also expanding into international operations which we believe will improve our results 
during the first two quarters of  the company managed and reported through four business segments engineering  construction  automation and land 
in may  the company hired a new ceo 
the ceo  as the chief operating decision maker  has assessed the company business organization and management structure resulting in management changes  a new focus on specific types of work and reorganization of integrated functions within the company 
in response to these changes  we reevaluated our reportable segments 
as a result  we elected to realign our reporting into three business segments engineering  automation and land 
our services that were offered under the previous construction segment were merged into our current reporting segments 
during the fourth quarter of  we renamed our operating segments to engineering and construction  automation and field solutions 
the total amounts reported for prior periods will remain the same  but amounts reported on a segment basis are reported in the three segments that the company now operates in  rather than the four segments in which the company previously operated and reported 
the engineering and construction segment provides services relating to the development  management and execution of projects requiring professional engineering and related project services primarily to the midstream and downstream sectors 
services provided by the engineering and construction segment include feasibility studies  engineering  design  procurement and construction management 
the automation segment provides services related to the design  fabrication and implementation of process distributed control and analyzer systems  advanced automation  information technology  electrical and heat tracing projects primarily to the upstream and downstream sectors 
the field solutions segment provides inspection  land management  right of way  environmental compliance  legislative affairs support and governmental regulatory compliance services primarily to the midstream sector  including pipeline  utility and telecom companies and other owner operators of infrastructure facilities throughout the united states 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company revenue is composed of engineering  procurement and construction service revenue and engineered systems sales 
the company recognizes service revenue as soon as the services are performed 
the majority of the company engineering services have historically been provided through time and material contracts whereas a majority of the company engineered system sales are earned on fixed price contracts 
in the course of providing our services  we routinely provide engineering  materials and equipment and may provide construction services on a direct hire or subcontractor basis 
generally  these materials  equipment and subcontractor costs are passed through to our clients and reimbursed  along with fees  which in total are at margins lower than those of our normal core business 
in accordance with industry practice and generally accepted accounting principles  all such costs and fees are included in revenue 
the use of subcontractor services can change significantly from project to project  therefore  changes in revenue and gross profit  sg a expense and operating income as a percent of revenue may not be indicative of the company core business trends 
operating sg a expense includes management and staff compensation  office costs such as rents and utilities  depreciation  amortization  travel  bad debt and other expenses generally unrelated to specific client contracts  but directly related to the support of a segment operations 
all other sg a expense is comprised primarily of business development costs  as well as costs related to executive  investor relations governance  finance  accounting  health safety environmental  human resources  legal and information technology departments and other costs generally unrelated to specific projects but which are incurred to support corporate activities and initiatives

we had increases in revenue in of million  or  related to material and subcontractor purchases 
overall revenue decreased in as a result of our clients continued cancellation or delay of scheduled capital projects due to the economy in general  lower energy commodity prices and lower energy processing margins 
in addition  revenues were impacted by the completion of several larger projects which were not replaced with new project work 
our clients are continuing to perform run and maintain type smaller projects which focus on work for required maintenance to keep the plant up and running but not on new capital expansions 
competition has also increased greatly for the amount of project work on the market

competition had also increased greatly for the amount of project work on the market 
gross profit the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue in relative to was caused by several factors including lower utilization of our billable resources resulting in increased overhead costs to retain employees  increased overhead costs to expand our marketing to new sectors and new clients  increased per employee costs of benefits and market pressure to renegotiate some of our existing contracts  resulting in lower margins 
also  we had significant increases in procurement activities which are generally performed at lower margins than labor 
these same factors  except for the increase in procurement activities  contributed to lower gross profit margins in relative to selling  general and administrative sg a expenses the increase in operating sg a expense for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the comparable period  primarily consisted of increases in bad debt expense of million mainly attributable to the sle and bigler write offs net of allowance adjustments  million in professional services expenses  million in salaries and employee related expenses  million in depreciation and amortization expenses and million in taxes  offset by decreases of million in stock compensation expense

as a percentage of revenue  all other sg a expense increased to for the twelve months ended december   from for the comparable prior year period 
operating profit the decrease in operating income for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the comparable period  was attributable to lower revenue levels as well as increased costs for both new sales efforts  maintaining core employees at a time when the company had fewer projects and the sle and bigler write offs 
these increased costs contributed to lower operating income as a percentage of revenue as well as decreased contract margins in response to market pressures

many of our clients have delayed or canceled scheduled capital projects due to the economy  lower commodity prices and lower energy processing margins 
instead  they are focusing more on maintenance run and maintain projects which  historically  are smaller than many of the other projects in which we have been involved 
competition has increased greatly for the amount of project work on the market impacting both our ability to get projects from existing clients and our ability to win new clients 
nonetheless  we maintain a base of significant clients for whom we have performed engineering services for many years and  while these clients have fewer projects  they continue to award projects to us 
however  due to market pressures  we have renegotiated some of our existing contracts to accept lower margins and we have lost some projects due to competitive pricing pressures 
we are also focusing on increased marketing efforts not only to expand our opportunities in the chemical  refining and pipeline sectors  but also to expand into other markets within the energy and infrastructure sector  and to expand into international markets 
the engineering and construction segment estimated backlog at december  was million 
our detail design service revenues decreased by from to  and again by from to the decrease in both and was mainly due to decreased demand for engineering and related professional services for energy related projects 
this decrease in demand was caused by delayed or canceled capital project work by clients in reaction to the economy 
this area of service revenues was impacted the most due to the level of capital work that is performed in this area 
our field services revenues decreased by from to but increased by from to the decrease in was due to general decreases in demand from our existing customers for in plant resources 
however  in our clients demands leveled out and we are now beginning to see some new opportunities for growth in this area and are exploring the possibility of marketing to a broader range of prospective clients 
revenue from procurement services increased  from to but had decreased from to the increase in was due to work performed for a new client that was expanding a gas field with exhuming  holding and loading functionality 
the significant decrease in  as compared to the comparable period  primarily related to a large project to rebuild a client facility which was completed in the level of procurement services varies over time depending on the volume of procurement activity our customers choose to do themselves as opposed to using our services 
fixed price revenues increased from to and again by from to due to the current economy  more clients are requesting work to be performed on a fixed price basis to control their costs and shift risk to their contractors 
we expect to continue to see increased trends in this type of work awarded by the clients 
gross profit our engineering and construction segment total gross profit increased in  as compared with  but had decreased in  as compared with of the overall increase in gross profit for  million was attributable to decreased costs  while increased revenues contributed to million of the overall increase 
as a percentage of the engineering and construction segment revenue  the engineering and construction segment gross profit decreased from in to in  but increased to in from in the increase during is mainly due to cost cutting measures implemented in response to the lower revenues during  which included decreasing our number of employees  therefore  reducing our overhead costs 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the decrease in total gross profit percentages for  as compared to  was partially the result of clients awarding new work based on competitive bidding  resulting in lower margins 
these lower margins along with increased per employee costs of benefits accounted for of the overall decrease in gross profit percentage 
in response to the decrease in work  we decreased our number of employees 
however  realization of the cost savings associated with reducing our workforce lags a period of increased overhead costs associated with employees being removed from projects and being carried as non billable employees prior to termination 
the additional costs of carrying these extra employees accounted for of the overall gross profit percentage decline 
operating selling  general and administrative sg a expenses the increase in the engineering and construction segment sg a expense in from was due to increases of million in bad debt expense mainly attributable to the sle and bigler write offs net of allowance adjustments  million in professional services expenses and million in salaries and employee related expenses  offset by decreases of million in facilities expenses and million in stock compensation expenses

cdi designs and manufactures industrial automation control systems primarily for the upstream energy industry 
these services complement the other services historically provided by our automation segment and will allow us to expand further into the upstream market 
under the terms of the asset acquisition agreement  englobal did not assume any cdi debt  nor was it required to issue any stock as consideration for the acquired assets 
results of the cdi operations are included in the automation segment beginning april  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued revenue the automation segment contributed of our total revenues for revenues  particularly from non fabrication operations  declined due to clients delays or cancellations of capital projects 
competition has increased greatly for the amount of project work on the market impacting both our ability to get projects from existing clients and our ability to win new clients 
in addition  due to market pressures  we have renegotiated some of our existing contracts to accept lower margins and we have lost some projects due to competitive pricing pressures 
the automation segment estimated backlog at december  was million  but the backlog could be negatively impacted by the current and possible future economic conditions 
the overall increase from our fabrication revenue from to was attributable to our offering new or expanded services to new and existing customers 
the overall increase from our fabrication revenue from to was mainly attributable to new work acquired as a result of our increased sales effort 
the overall decrease in our non fabrication revenue from to was mainly attributable to the completion of larger projects that did not have the same level of new work to replace them due to clients delays or cancellations of capital projects 
the overall increase in our non fabrication revenue from to was derived from services that we were able to provide as a result of the september acquisition of advanced control engineering llc and increased sales efforts 
gross profit of the overall decrease in our automation segment gross profit from to  million was attributable to decreased revenues  while increased costs contributed to million of the overall decrease 
of the total gross profit percentage decrease  percentage points were attributable to reduced margins due to competitive pressure and increased overhead costs related to expanding our services during the year 
this included the up front costs associated with offering new services 
we expect that the margins will improve in these new areas as the sales catch up with the initial up front effort expended 
the remainder of the decrease in gross profit is due to higher direct costs  as a percentage of lower revenue 
of the total gross profit percentage decrease from to  percentage points were attributable to indirect costs associated with carrying under utilized employees  while the remainder of the decrease is due to higher direct costs  as a percentage of revenue

the field solutions segment estimated backlog at december  was million 
however  the backlog may be negatively impacted by current and possible future economic conditions 
the overall decrease in revenue from inspection related services from to was primarily attributable to the completion of ongoing projects as well as our clients delay or cancellation of projects 
the overall decrease in revenue from inspection related services from to was primarily attributable to the general downturn of the economy that caused many of our clients to delay or cancel scheduled capital projects 
the overall decrease in revenue from land related services from to was primarily attributable to clients delaying capital projects and competitive pricing pressures as well as the completion or downsizing of several projects 
the overall decrease in revenue from land related services from to was primarily attributable to clients delaying capital projects and competitive pricing pressures as a result of the economic downturn 
gross profit due to current economic conditions and market pressures  we are experiencing client demands for lower costs  therefore  we have renegotiated some of our existing projects to accept lower margins 
as a result  some of our contracts provide lower margins than we have earned in the past 
this trend is adversely affecting gross profit in our field solutions segment 
of the overall decrease in our field solutions segment gross profit from to  million was attributable to increased costs  while decreased revenues contributed to million of the decrease 
of the total gross profit percentage decrease  lower margins resulting from competitive pressures accounted for approximately percentage points while the remaining percentage points decrease is attributable to increased non billable and indirect costs associated with compensating employees during periods when they are not engaged in billable projects

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources overview the company defines liquidity as its ability to pay liabilities as they become due  fund business operations and meet monetary contractual obligations 
our primary source of liquidity at december  was borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility with wells fargo bank the wells fargo credit facility  discussed under senior revolving credit facility below 
cash on hand at december  totaled  and availability under the wells fargo credit facility totaled  after consideration of loan covenant restrictions  resulting in total liquidity of  we believe that we have sufficient available cash required for operations for the next months 
however  we are in the process of negotiating an increase in our wells fargo credit facility and in addition  cash and the availability of cash could be materially restricted if revenues continue to decline as a result of the factors discussed in the risk factors section  amounts billed are not collected or are not collected in a timely manner  circumstances prevent the timely internal processing of invoices  project mix continues to shift from cost reimbursable to fixed price contracts and we are unable to accurately estimate the project costs  resulting in cost overruns  the company loses one or more of its major customers or its major customers continue to significantly reduce the amount of work requested from the company  our client mix shifts from our historical owner operator client base to more developer based clients  acquisitions are not integrated timely or effectively  or we continue to be unable to maintain compliance with the covenants of the wells fargo credit facility or to obtain waivers when necessary 
if any such event occurs  we would be forced to consider alternative financing options 
cash flows from operating activities operating activities required the use of million in net cash in but provided million and million in net cash in and respectively 
for the year ended december   the changes in working capital were primarily due to increased trade receivables of million  decreased notes receivable of million attributable to the write offs of bigler and sle  increased income taxes receivable of million  increased accounts payable of million and decreased accrued compensation and benefits of million 
the increase in trade receivables was primarily the result of increased operating activity 
our days sales outstanding has increased from days for the twelve month period ended december  to days for the twelve month period ended december  the company manages its billing and client collection processes toward reducing days sales outstanding to the extent practicable 
we believe that our allowance for bad debt is adequate to cover any potential non payment by our customers 
the increase in accounts payable was primarily the result of increased purchasing activity in our engineering and construction segment during the three months ended december  the decrease in accrued compensation and benefits was primarily due to timing of bi weekly payroll 
cash flows from investing activities investing activities used cash totaling million in  compared to million in and million in in  investing activities were primarily used for capital additions and the investment made to acquire selected assets of cdi 
in  investing activities were primarily used for capital additions and the investment made to acquire the operations of pci 
in  investing activities were primarily used for capital additions and the investment made to acquire ace 
future investing activities are anticipated to remain consistent with prior years and include capital additions for leasehold improvements  technical applications software and equipment  such as upgrades to computers  as well as acquisitions 
the wells fargo credit facility discussed under senior revolving credit facility below limits annual capital expenditures to million and acquisitions require prior approval by wells fargo 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued cash flows from financing activities financing activities provided cash totaling million in and used cash totaling million and million and  respectively 
during  our primary financing mechanism was our line of credit under the wells fargo credit facility 
the line of credit was used principally to finance working capital requirements and treasury stock purchases 
during  our borrowings on the line of credit were million in the aggregate and we repaid an aggregate of million 
during  our borrowings on the line of credit were million in the aggregate 
on december   the wells fargo credit facility replaced the comerica credit facility 
during  our borrowings on the comerica credit facility line of credit were million in the aggregate  and we repaid an aggregate of million on our short term and long term bank and other debt 
we anticipate that future cash flows from financing activities will be borrowings  payments on the line of credit and payments on long term debt instruments 
line of credit fluctuations are a function of timing related to operations  obligations and payments received on accounts receivable 
we estimate that payments on long term debt  including interest for the coming year  will be million 
senior revolving credit facility historically  we have satisfied our cash requirements through operations and borrowings under a revolving credit facility 
in december  the company entered into a new credit agreement with wells fargo bank  which provides a twenty eight month  million senior secured revolving credit facility wells fargo credit facility 
the wells fargo credit facility is guaranteed by substantially all of company subsidiaries  is secured by substantially all of the company assets and positions wells fargo as senior to all other debt 
on september   the company entered into an amendment to the credit agreement with wells fargo bank which converted our borrowings from a revolving credit facility to an asset based lending agreement 
the amendment allows for borrowings limited to an aggregate of of our current eligible accounts receivable agings and of unbilled receivable agings to a cap of million or of our current eligible accounts receivable agings 
eligible accounts receivable agings include deduction for standard items such as invoices past due over days  fixed price work  foreign receivables and government work 
the amendment also eliminated the asset coverage ratio and increased the unused commitment fee from thirty basis points to fifty basis points per annum 
the outstanding balance on the wells fargo credit facility as of december  was million at a fluctuating rate per terms of the wells fargo credit facility 
the remaining borrowings available under the wells fargo credit facility as of december  were million after consideration of loan covenant restrictions 
at the company option  amounts borrowed under the wells fargo credit facility will bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum determined by wells fargo to be three and three quarters percent above the daily one month libor rate in effect from time to time 
the wells fargo credit facility includes a commitment fee of basis points for the unused portion of the million credit facility 
the company credit facility requires the company to maintain certain financial covenants as of the end of each calendar quarter  including the following total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio not greater than to  and fixed charge coverage ratio not less than to  total liabilities is defined as the aggregate of current liabilities and non current liabilities 
tangible net worth is defined as the aggregate of total stockholders equity less any intangible assets and less any loans or advances to  or investments in  any related entities or individuals 
fixed charge coverage ratio is determined on a rolling four quarter basis and is defined as ebitda minus cash taxes  divided by interest expense  plus the current maturity of long term debt  where ebitda is net income  plus interest expense  plus income taxes  plus depreciation and amortization  plus stock compensation expense 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company was not in compliance with all covenants under the wells fargo credit facility as of december   however  wells fargo waived its default rights with respect to the breach for the fourth quarter of only 
anticipating a covenant breach in the first quarter of  the million line of credit outstanding was classified as current long term debt on the balance sheet as of december  for the quarterly period ended december   our total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio ranged from to  and our fixed charge coverage ratio ranged from to 
during the twelve month period ended december  we expended or committed approximately  or million  of the million fiscal year covenant limitation on capital expenditures 
the balance of our capital expenditures for the twelve month period has been for normal operating requirements including office furniture  computers  software and vehicles 
the wells fargo credit facility also contains covenants that place certain limitations on the company including limits on capital expenditures  other indebtedness  mergers  asset sales  investments  guaranties  restrictions on certain distributions and pledges of assets 
letters of credit as of december   the company had outstanding letters of credit totaling  primarily to cover self insured deductibles under both our general liability and workers compensation insurance policies

contingent liabilities and commitments to our knowledge  the company is not exposed to any environmental liability 
the company does not have any product liability issues 
lease commitments are included in footnote of the consolidated financial statements 
the company leases all of its office space 
the company has no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
income tax provision on july   the fasb issued fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  and related implementation issues 
this standard provides guidance on the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
financial statements should reflect expected future tax consequences of such positions presuming the taxing authorities have full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
this interpretation also revises the disclosure requirements and was adopted by the company effective as of january  there are currently no material tax positions identified as uncertain for the company or its subsidiaries 
we recognize interest related to uncertain tax positions in interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in governmental penalties 
as of december   we have not recognized interest or penalties relating to any uncertain tax positions 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company is subject to federal and state income tax audits from time to time that could result in proposed assessments 
the company cannot predict with certainty the timing of such audits  how these audits would be resolved and whether the company would be required to make additional tax payments  which may or may not include penalties and interest 
the company is not currently the subject of any examination by the internal revenue service  and the open years subject to audit are tax years for most states where the company conducts business  the company is subject to examination for the preceding three to six years 
asset management we typically sell our products and services on short term credit and seek to minimize our credit risk by performing credit checks and conducting our own collection efforts 
our trade accounts receivable increased to million as of december  from million as of december  the number of days sales outstanding for trade accounts receivable increased slightly from days at december   to days at december  bad debt expense was approximately and of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts from million to million or and of trade accounts receivable balance for each of the years and  respectively 
while we continue to manage this portion of our business very carefully  it is possible that our days sales outstanding  bad debt expense and allowance for doubtful accounts will deteriorate if the economy continues to decline 
risk management in performing services for our clients  we could potentially face liability for breach of contract  personal injury  property damage or negligence  including professional errors and omissions 
we often agree to indemnify our clients for losses and expenses incurred as a result of our negligence and  in certain cases  the sole or concurrent negligence of our clients 
our quality control and assurance program includes a control function to establish standards and procedures for performance and for documentation of project tasks  and an assurance function to audit and to monitor compliance with procedures and quality standards 
we maintain liability insurance for bodily injury and third party property damage  professional errors and omissions  and workers compensation coverage  which we consider sufficient to insure against these risks  subject to self insured amounts 
seasonality holidays and employee vacations during our fourth quarter exert downward pressure on revenues for that quarter  which is only partially offset by the year end efforts on the part of many clients to spend any remaining funds budgeted for services and capital expenditures during the year 
the annual budgeting and approval process under which these clients operate is normally not completed until after the beginning of each year  which can depress results for the first quarter 
principally due to these factors  our first and fourth quarters are typically less robust than our second and third quarters 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition because the majority of the company revenue is recognized under time and material contracts  significant estimates are generally not involved in determining revenue recognition for these type of contracts 
significant estimates may be involved in determining revenue recognition for fixed price contracts 
most of our contracts are with fortune companies 
as a result  collection risk is generally not a relevant factor in the recognition of revenue 
however  timing of accounts receivable collections could have a serious impact in the company liquidity 
we have instituted policies to determine the creditworthiness of new customers 
adverse changes in the economy are likely to impact smaller companies ability to undertake and finance projects 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our revenue is largely composed of engineering service revenue and product sales 
the majority of our services are provided through time and material contracts also referred to as cost plus contracts 
some contracts have not to exceed provisions that place a cap on the revenue that we may receive under a particular contract 
the contract is awarded with the maximum aggregate revenue  referred to as the not to exceed amount 
the company does not earn revenue over the not to exceed amount unless we obtain a change order 
the current amount of revenue deferred for these reasons is million 
the company is not obligated to complete the contract once the not to exceed amount has been reached 
however  if the company performs work over the not to exceed amount prior to obtaining a valid change order  it impacts our gross profit margins 
billings on time and material contracts are produced every two weeks 
on occasion  we serve as purchasing agent by procuring subcontractors  material and equipment on behalf of a client and passing the cost on to the client with no mark up or profit 
revenue and cost for these types of purchases are not included in total revenue and cost 
for financial reporting  this pass through type of transaction is reported net 
in  we had million of pass through transactions 
we had no pass through transactions in and revenue on fixed price contracts is recorded primarily using the percentage of completion cost to cost method 
under this method  revenue on long term contracts is recognized in the ratio that contract costs incurred bear to total estimated contract costs 
revenue and gross margin on fixed price contracts are subject to revision throughout the lives of the contracts and any required adjustments are made in the period in which the revisions become known 
to manage unknown risks  management may use contingency amounts to increase the estimated costs  therefore  lowering the earned revenues until the risks are better identified and quantified or have been mitigated 
we currently have million in contingency 
losses on contracts are recorded in full as they are identified 
the asset  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  represents revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed on fixed price contracts 
the company inability to manage significant levels or increases in costs and estimated earning in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts could have a serious impact on the company cash flow 
the liability billings in excess of costs and estimated profits on uncompleted contracts represents amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized on fixed price contracts 
change orders change orders are modifications of an original contract that effectively change deliverables under a contract without adding new provisions 
either we or our clients may initiate change orders 
change orders may include changes in specifications or design  manner of performance  equipment  materials  scope of work and or the period of completion of the project 
change orders occur when changes are experienced once a contract is begun 
change orders are sometimes documented and in most cases the terms of change orders are agreed upon with the client before the work is performed 
other times  circumstances may require that work progress without the client written agreement before the work is performed 
in those cases  we are taking a risk that the customer will not sign a change order or at a later time the customer will seek to negotiate the pricing of the additional work 
costs related to change orders are recognized when they are incurred 
change orders are included in the total estimated contract revenue when it is more likely than not that the change orders will result in a bona fide addition to value that can be reliably estimated 
we have a favorable history of negotiating and collecting for work performed under change orders and our bi weekly billing cycle has proven to be timely enough to properly account for change orders 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquisitions over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized and is tested at least annually for impairment 
we perform our annual analysis as of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and in any period in which indicators of impairment warrant an additional analysis 
reporting units for the purpose of goodwill impairment calculations are components one level below our reportable operating segments for which discreet financial information is available and reviewed by segment management 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step process 
in step of the goodwill impairment test  the fair value of each reporting unit is determined and compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
in step  if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  including goodwill  then the goodwill is written down to the implied fair value of the goodwill through a charge to expense 
management utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
significant judgments and assumptions  including determination of an appropriate discount rate  projecting revenue growth and gross margins  estimating operating and interest expense and projecting capital expenditure levels  are involved in making these fair value estimates  with the most critical estimates being projected growth rate and discount rate 
the projected growth rate incorporates the company budget and management estimate of the long term growth rate of the company based on certain internal estimates and external data 
the discount rate utilized in the analysis was a weighted average cost of capital wacc 
wacc is an estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt market participants of a business enterprise  with the weighting of returns based on the capitalization of comparable companies 
while we use the best available information to prepare our cash flow projections and wacc assumptions  actual future cash flows  costs of capital or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment and charges related to recorded goodwill balances 
during  the company realigned its reporting into three business segments 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  the company further consolidated its legal entities and internal reporting and renamed the reportable segments as engineering and construction  automation and field solutions 
as a result  goodwill that was previously reported in the construction segment which no longer exists as a separate segment was reallocated to engineering and construction and field solutions 
other than the change in reporting segments and reporting units  our methodologies for performing our goodwill impairment analysis have not changed from the prior year 
however  the wacc assumption decreased approximately percentage points for the current year analysis 
the fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value in excess of 
deterioration in our expected operating results or increases in our cost of capital could have a negative effect on fair value and lead to an impairment charge in the future 
a decrease in our budgeted short term growth rate holding all other assumptions constant would have the following impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units  summarized by segment engineering and construction million automation million field solutions million these hypothetical changes would not cause step of the goodwill impairment test to be required for any of our reporting units 
a decrease in our projected long term growth rate holding all other assumptions constant would have the following impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units  summarized by segment engineering and construction million automation million field solutions million these hypothetical changes would not cause step of the goodwill impairment test to be required for any of our reporting units 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued a increase in our assumed discount rate holding all other assumptions constant would have the following impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units  summarized by segment engineering and construction million automation million field solutions million these hypothetical changes would not cause step of the goodwill impairment test to be required for the reporting units within any of our segments 
deferred tax the company had net deferred tax asset balances of million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
these net deferred tax assets are identified in footnote to the financial statements 
the company had a federal net operating loss carry forward at december  of approximately  earlier utilization of the net operating loss on the company and consolidated tax returns was disallowed by the irs which resulted in a reinstated carry forward 
the prior year net operating loss of approximately  will be available through the current year net operating loss of approximately  will be available for carry back to and and for carry forward through the company also has a foreign net operating loss carry forward at december  of approximately million 
this loss is available for utilization from through  however  application of the net operating loss is restricted to the income of englobal canada 
the company is unsure of its ability to fully utilize the foreign net operating loss 
therefore  the company has set up a valuation allowance of  against the net operating loss 
recent accounting pronouncements there were no new recent accounting pronouncements during that would materially impact the company financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  and  the company did not participate in any derivative financial instruments or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required 
there are no material investments at december  accordingly  the company has no quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments 
the company primary interest rate risk relates to its variable rate line of credit debt obligation  which totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
assuming a increase in the interest rate on this variable rate debt obligation ie  an increase from the actual average interest rate of as of december   to an average interest rate of  annual interest expense would have been approximately  higher in based on our annual average line of credit obligation 
due to the current credit market  a greater concern is the impact of a material violation of certain financial covenants in our credit agreement resulting in a re pricing of that agreement 
this could not only result in the increased annual interest expense but also a renewal or origination fee of equal proportion on a similar credit agreement 
the company does not have any interest rate swap or exchange agreements 
the company has no market risk exposure in the areas of interest rate risk from investments because the company did not have an investment portfolio as of december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currently  the company does not engage in foreign currency hedging activities 
transactions in canadian dollars in our canadian subsidiary have been translated into us dollars using the current rate method  such that assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date and revenue and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange during the appropriate fiscal period 
as a result  the carrying value of the company investments in canada is subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations 
additionally  any revenue received from the company international operations in other than us dollars will be subject to foreign exchange risk 
the percentage of revenue received from foreign customers is identified in the discussion of segment revenue 
most revenue received from foreign customers is paid to the company in u 
s 
currency  except for revenue collected by our canadian subsidiaries 
the canadian dollar is not subject to volatile price fluctuations compared to the us dollar
