risk factors 
risks inherent in the distribution of propane weather conditions may reduce the demand for propane  our financial condition is vulnerable to warm winters and poor weather in the grilling season 
weather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for propane for both heating and agricultural purposes 
many of our customers rely heavily on propane as a heating fuel 
accordingly  our sales volumes of propane are highest during the five month winter heating season of november through march and are directly affected by the temperatures during these months 
during fiscal  approximately of our propane sales volume was attributable to sales during the winter heating season 
actual weather conditions can vary substantially from year to year  which may significantly affect our financial performance 
furthermore  variations in weather in one or more regions in which we operate can significantly affect our total propane sales volume and therefore our realized profits 
a negative effect on our sales volume may in turn affect our financial position or results of operations 
the agricultural demand for propane is also affected by weather  as dry or warm weather during the harvest season may reduce the demand for propane used in some crop drying applications 
our portable tank exchange operations experience higher volumes in the spring and summer  which includes the majority of the grilling season 
sustained periods of poor weather  particularly in the grilling season  can negatively affect our portable tank exchange revenues 
in addition  poor weather may reduce consumers propensity to purchase and use grills and other propane fueled appliances thereby reducing demand for portable tank exchange as well as the demand for our outdoor products 

table of contents sudden and sharp propane wholesale price increases cannot be passed on to customers with contracted pricing arrangements and these contracted pricing arrangements will adversely affect our profit margins if they are not immediately hedged with an offsetting propane purchase commitment 
gross margin from the retail distribution of propane is primarily based on the cents per gallon difference between the sales price we charge our customers and our costs to purchase and deliver propane to our propane distribution locations 
we enter into propane sales commitments with a portion of our customers that provide for a contracted price agreement for a specified period of time 
the wholesale propane price per gallon is subject to various market conditions and may fluctuate based on changes in demand  supply and other energy commodity prices 
propane prices tend to correlate primarily with crude oil and natural gas prices 
we employ risk management activities that attempt to mitigate risks related to the purchasing  storing  transporting  and selling of propane 
however  sudden and sharp propane price increases cannot be passed on to customers with contracted pricing arrangements 
therefore  these commitments expose us to product price risk and reduced profit margins if those transactions are not immediately hedged with an offsetting propane purchase commitment 
sudden and sharp wholesale propane price decreases may result in customers not fulfilling their obligations under contracted pricing arrangements previously entered into with us 
the decreased sales volumes of these higher sales price arrangements may adversely affect our profit margins 
we may attempt to lock in a gross margin per gallon on our contracted sales commitments by immediately hedging or entering into a fixed price propane purchase contract 
if we were to experience sudden and sharp propane price decreases  our customers may not fulfill their obligation to purchase propane from us at their previously contracted price per gallon and we may not be able to sell the related hedged or fixed price propane at a profitable sales price per gallon in the current pricing environment 
our failure or our counterparties failure to perform on obligations under commodity derivative and financial derivative contracts could materially affect our liquidity  cash flows and results of operations 
volatility in the oil and gas commodities sector for an extended period of time or intense volatility in the near term could impair us or our counterparties ability to meet margin calls which could cause us or our counterparties to default on commodity and financial derivative contracts 
this could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or our ability to procure product or procure it at prices reasonable to us 
hurricanes and other natural disasters could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
hurricanes and other natural disasters can potentially destroy thousands of business structures and homes and  if occurring in the gulf coast region of the united states  could disrupt the supply chain for oil and gas products 
disruptions in supply could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
damages and higher prices caused by hurricanes and other natural disasters could have an adverse effect on our financial condition due to the impact on the financial condition of our customers 
the propane distribution business is highly competitive  which may negatively affect our sales volumes and or our results of operations 
our profitability is affected by the competition for customers among all of the participants in the propane distribution business 
we compete with a number of large national and regional firms and several thousand small independent firms 
because of the relatively low barriers to entry into the propane market  there is the potential for small independent propane distributors  as well as other companies not previously engaged in propane distribution  to compete with us 
some rural electric cooperatives and fuel oil distributors have expanded their businesses to include propane distribution 
as a result  we are subject to the risk of additional competition in the future 
some of our competitors may have greater financial resources than we do 
should a competitor attempt to increase market share by reducing prices  our operating margins and customer base may be negatively impacted 
generally  warmer than normal weather and increasing fuel prices further intensifies competition 
we believe that our ability to compete 
table of contents effectively depends on our service reliability  our responsiveness to customers  and our ability to maintain competitive propane prices and control our operating expenses 
the propane distribution industry is a mature one  which may limit our growth 
the propane distribution industry is a mature one 
we foresee only limited growth in total national demand for propane in the near future 
year to year industry volumes are primarily impacted by fluctuations in temperatures and economic conditions 
our ability to grow our sales volumes within the propane distribution industry is primarily dependent upon our ability to acquire other propane distributors  to integrate those acquisitions into our operations  and upon the success of our marketing efforts to acquire new customers 
if we are unable to compete effectively in the propane distribution business  we may lose existing customers or fail to acquire new customers 
the propane distribution business faces competition from other energy sources  which may reduce the existing demand for our propane 
propane competes with other sources of energy  some of which can be less costly for equivalent energy value 
we compete for customers against suppliers of electricity  natural gas and fuel oil 
electricity is a major competitor of propane  but propane has historically enjoyed a competitive price advantage over electricity 
except for some industrial and commercial applications  propane is generally not competitive with natural gas in areas where natural gas pipelines already exist  because such pipelines generally make it possible for the delivered cost of natural gas to be less expensive than the bulk delivery of propane 
the expansion of natural gas into traditional propane markets has historically been inhibited by the capital cost required to expand distribution and pipeline systems  however  the gradual expansion of the nation s natural gas distribution systems has resulted in the availability of natural gas in areas that were previously dependent upon propane 
although propane is similar to fuel oil in some applications and market demand  propane and fuel oil compete to a lesser extent primarily because of the cost of converting from one to the other and due to the fact that both fuel oil and propane have generally developed their own distinct geographic markets 
we cannot predict the effect that the development of alternative energy sources might have on our financial position or results of operations 
energy efficiency and technology advances may affect demand for propane  increases in propane prices may cause our residential customers to increase their conservation efforts 
the national trend toward increased conservation and technological advances  including installation of improved insulation and the development of more efficient furnaces and other heating devices  has reduced the demand for propane in our industry 
we cannot predict the materiality of the effect of future conservation measures or the effect that any technological advances in heating  conservation  energy generation or other devices might have on our operations 
as the price of propane increases  some of our customers tend to increase their conservation efforts and thereby decrease their consumption of propane 
the continuing world wide financial crisis may cause disruptions in the capital and credit markets that may adversely affect our business  including the availability and cost of debt and equity issuances for liquidity requirements  our ability to meet long term commitments and our ability to hedge effectively  each could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
we rely on our ability to access the capital and credit markets at rates and terms reasonable to us 
if the world wide financial crisis were to cause disruptions in the capital and credit markets  our ability to access capital and credit markets at rates and terms reasonable to us may be significantly impaired 
this could limit our ability to access capital or credit markets for working capital needs  risk management activities and long term debt maturities  or could force us to access capital and credit markets at rates or terms normally considered to be unreasonable or force us to take other aggressive actions including the suspension of our quarterly distribution 

table of contents current economic and political conditions may harm the energy business disproportionately to other industries 
deteriorating regional and global economic conditions and the effects of ongoing military actions may cause significant disruptions to commerce throughout the world 
if those disruptions occur in areas of the world which are tied to the energy industry  such as the middle east  it is most likely that our industry will be either affected first or affected to a greater extent than other industries 
these conditions or disruptions may impair our ability to effectively market or acquire propane  or impair our ability to raise equity or debt capital for acquisitions  capital expenditures or ongoing operations 
a significant increase in motor fuel prices may adversely affect our profits 
motor fuel is a significant operating expense for us in connection with the delivery of propane to our customers 
because we do not attempt to hedge motor fuel price risk  a significant increase in motor fuel prices will result in increased transportation costs to us 
the price and supply of motor fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events we cannot control  such as geopolitical developments  supply and demand for oil and gas  actions by oil and gas producers  war and unrest in oil producing countries and regions  regional production patterns and weather concerns 
as a result  any increases in these prices may adversely affect our profitability and competitiveness 
the revenues received from our portable tank exchange are concentrated with a limited number of retailers under non exclusive arrangements that may be terminated at will 
the propane gallons sales that we generate from our delivery of propane by portable tank exchange are concentrated with a limited number of retailers 
if one or more of these retailers were to materially reduce or terminate its business with us  the results from our delivery of propane by portable tank exchange operations may decline 
for fiscal  three retailers represented approximately of our portable tank exchange s net revenues 
none of our significant retail accounts associated with our portable tank exchange operations are contractually bound to offer portable tank exchange service or products 
therefore  retailers can discontinue our delivery of propane to them by portable tank exchange service  or sales of our propane related products  at any time and accept a competitor s delivery of propane by portable tank exchange  or its related propane products or none at all 
continued relations with a retailer depend upon various factors  including price  customer service  consumer demand and competition 
in addition  most of our significant retailers have multiple vendor policies and may seek to accept a competitor s delivery of propane by portable tank exchange  or accept products competitive with our propane related products  at new or existing locations of these significant retailers 
if any significant retailer materially reduces  terminates or requires price reductions or other adverse modifications in our selling terms  our results from our delivery of propane by portable tank exchange operations may decline 
if the independently owned distributors that some of our customers rely upon for the delivery of propane by portable tank exchange do not perform up to the expectations of such customers  if we encounter difficulties in managing the operations of these distributors or if we or these distributors are not able to manage growth effectively  our relationships with our customers may be adversely impacted and our delivery of propane by portable tank exchange may decline 
we rely in part on independently owned distributors to deliver our propane for a retailer s portable tank exchange service 
accordingly  our success depends on our ability to maintain and manage distributor relationships and operations and on the distributors ability to set up and adequately service accounts 
we exercise only limited influence over the resources that the independently owned distributors devote to the delivery of propane by portable tank exchange 
national retailers impose demanding service requirements on us  and we could experience a loss of consumer or retailer goodwill if our distributors do not adhere to our quality control and service guidelines or fail to ensure the timely delivery of an adequate supply of propane by portable tank exchange at retail locations 
the poor performance of a single distributor to a national retailer could jeopardize our entire relationship with that retailer and cause our delivery of propane by portable tank exchange to that particular retailer to decline 
in addition  the number of retail locations accepting delivery of our propane by portable tank exchange and  subsequently  the retailer s corresponding sales have historically grown significantly along with the creation of our distributor network 

table of contents accordingly  our distributors must be able to adequately service an increasing number of retail accounts 
if we or our independent distributors fail to manage growth effectively  our financial results from our delivery of propane by portable tank exchange may decline 
potential retail partners may not be able to obtain necessary permits or may be substantially delayed in obtaining necessary permits  which may adversely impact our ability to increase our delivery of propane by portable tank exchange to new retail locations 
local ordinances  which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction  generally require retailers to obtain permits to store and sell propane tanks 
these ordinances influence retailers acceptance of propane by portable tank exchange  distribution methods  propane tank packaging and storage 
the ability and time required to obtain permits varies by jurisdiction 
delays in obtaining permits have from time to time significantly delayed the installation of new retail locations 
some jurisdictions have refused to issue the necessary permits  which has prevented some installations 
some jurisdictions may also impose additional restrictions on our ability to market and our distributors ability to transport propane tanks or otherwise maintain its portable tank exchange services 
risks inherent to our business our substantial debt and other financial obligations could impair our financial condition and our ability to fulfill our obligations 
we have substantial indebtedness and other financial obligations 
as of july  we had total indebtedness of approximately  million  ferrellgas partners had partners capital of approximately million  we had availability under our credit facility of approximately million  and we had aggregate future minimum rental commitments under non cancelable operating leases of approximately million  provided  however  if we elect to purchase the underlying assets at the end of the lease terms  such aggregate buyout would be million 
we have long and short term payment obligations with maturity dates ranging from fiscal to that bear interest at rates ranging from to 
as of july   the long term obligations do not contain any sinking fund provisions but do require the following aggregate principal payments  without premium  during the following fiscal years million  million  million  million  million  and  million thereafter 
our secured credit facility provides million in revolving credit for loans and has a million sublimit for letters of credit 
the obligations under this credit facility are secured by substantially all assets of the operating partnership  the general partner and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership but specifically excluding a assets that are subject to the operating partnership s accounts receivable securitization facility  b the general partner s equity interest in ferrellgas partners  lp and c equity interest in certain unrestricted subsidiaries 
such obligations are also guaranteed by the general partner and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership 
the secured revolving credit facility will mature in september all of the indebtedness and other obligations described above are obligations of the operating partnership except for million of senior debt due issued by ferrellgas partners and ferrellgas partners finance corp 

table of contents subject to the restrictions governing the operating partnership s indebtedness and other financial obligations and the indenture governing ferrellgas partners outstanding senior notes due  we may incur significant additional indebtedness and other financial obligations  which may be secured and or structurally senior to any debt securities we may issue 
our substantial indebtedness and other financial obligations could have important consequences to our security holders 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our securities  impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes  result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates since some of our debt is  and will continue to be  at variable rates of interest  impair our operating capacity and cash flows if we fail to comply with financial and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements and an event of default occurs as a result of that failure that is not cured or waived  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness and other financial obligations  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund distributions  working capital  capital expenditures and other general partnership requirements  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have proportionately less debt 
ferrellgas partners or the operating partnership may be unable to refinance their indebtedness or pay that indebtedness if it becomes due earlier than scheduled 
if ferrellgas partners or the operating partnership is unable to meet their debt service obligations or other financial obligations  they could be forced to restructure or refinance their indebtedness  enter into other necessary financial transactions  seek additional equity capital  or sell their assets 
they may then be unable to obtain such financing or capital or sell their assets on satisfactory terms  if at all 
their failure to make payments  whether after acceleration of the due date of that indebtedness or otherwise  or our failure to refinance the indebtedness would impair their operating capacity and cash flows 
restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness and other financial obligations may reduce our operating flexibility 
the indenture governing the outstanding notes of ferrellgas partners and the agreements governing the operating partnership s indebtedness and other financial obligations contain  and any indenture that will govern debt securities issued by ferrellgas partners or the operating partnership may contain  various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of specified subsidiaries of ours to  among other things incur additional indebtedness  make distributions to our unitholders  purchase or redeem our outstanding equity interests or subordinated debt  make specified investments  create or incur liens  
table of contents sell assets  engage in specified transactions with affiliates  restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make specified payments  loans  guarantees and transfers of assets or interests in assets  engage in sale leaseback transactions  effect a merger or consolidation with or into other companies or a sale of all or substantially all of our properties or assets  and engage in other lines of business 
these restrictions could limit the ability of ferrellgas partners  the operating partnership and our other subsidiaries to obtain future financings  to make needed capital expenditures  to withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general  or to conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise 
some of the agreements governing our indebtedness and other financial obligations also require the maintenance of specified financial ratios and the satisfaction of other financial conditions 
our ability to meet those financial ratios and conditions can be affected by unexpected downturns in business operations beyond our control  such as significantly warmer than normal weather  a volatile energy commodity cost environment or an economic downturn 
accordingly  we may be unable to meet these ratios and conditions 
this failure could impair our operating capacity and cash flows and could restrict our ability to incur debt or to make cash distributions  even if sufficient funds were available 
our breach of any of these covenants or the operating partnership s failure to meet any of these ratios or conditions could result in a default under the terms of the relevant indebtedness  which could cause such indebtedness or other financial obligations  and by reason of cross default provisions  any of ferrellgas partners or the operating partnership s other outstanding notes or future debt securities  to become immediately due and payable 
if we were unable to repay those amounts  the lenders could initiate a bankruptcy proceeding or liquidation proceeding or proceed against the collateral  if any 
if the lenders of the operating partnership s indebtedness or other financial obligations accelerate the repayment of borrowings or other amounts owed  we may not have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness or other financial obligations  including our outstanding notes and any future debt securities 
our results of operations and our ability to make distributions or pay interest or principal on debt securities could be negatively impacted by price and inventory risk and management of these risks 
the amount of gross profit we make depends significantly on the excess of the sales price over our costs to purchase and distribute propane 
consequently  our profitability is sensitive to changes in energy prices  in particular  changes in wholesale propane prices 
propane is a commodity whose market price can fluctuate significantly based on changes in supply  changes in other energy prices or other market conditions 
we have no control over these market conditions 
in general  product supply contracts permit suppliers to charge posted prices plus transportation costs at the time of delivery or the current prices established at major delivery points 
any increase in the price of product could reduce our gross profit because we may not be able to immediately pass rapid increases in such costs  or costs to distribute product  on to our customers 
while we generally attempt to minimize our inventory risk by purchasing product on a short term basis  we may purchase and store propane or other natural gas liquids depending on inventory and price outlooks 
we may purchase large volumes of propane at the then current market price during periods of low demand and low prices  which generally occurs during the summer months 
the market price for propane could fall below the price at which we made the purchases  which would adversely affect our profits or cause sales from that inventory to be unprofitable 
a portion of our inventory is purchased under 
table of contents supply contracts that typically have a one year term and at a price that fluctuates based on the prevailing market prices 
our contracts with our independent portable tank exchange distributors provide for a portion of our payment to the distributor to be based upon a price that fluctuates based on the prevailing propane market prices 
to limit our overall price risk  we may purchase and store physical product and enter into fixed price over the counter energy commodity forward contracts  swaps and options that have terms of up to months 
this strategy may not be effective in limiting our price risk if  for example  weather conditions significantly reduce customer demand  or market or weather conditions prevent the delivery of physical product during periods of peak demand  resulting in excess physical product after the end of the winter heating season and the expiration of related forward or option contracts 
some of our sales are pursuant to commitments at contracted price agreements 
to manage these commitments  we may purchase and store physical product and or enter into fixed price over the counter energy commodity forward contracts  swaps and options 
we may enter into these agreements at volume levels that we believe are necessary to mitigate the price risk related to our anticipated sales volumes under the commitments 
if the price of propane declines and our customers purchase less propane than we have purchased from our suppliers  we could incur losses when we sell the excess volumes 
if the price of propane increases and our customers purchase more propane than we have purchased from our suppliers  we could incur losses when we are required to purchase additional propane to fulfill our customers orders 
the risk management of our inventory and contracts for the future purchase of product could impair our profitability if the price of product changes in ways we do not anticipate 
the board of directors of our general partner has adopted a commodity risk management policy which places specified restrictions on all of our commodity risk management activities such as limits on the types of commodities  loss limits  time limits on contracts and limitations on our ability to enter into derivative contracts 
the policy also requires the establishment of a risk management committee of senior executives 
this committee is responsible for monitoring commodity risk management activities  establishing and maintaining timely reporting and establishing and monitoring specific limits on the various commodity risk management activities 
these limits may be waived on a case by case basis by a majority vote of the risk management committee and or board of directors  depending on the specific limit being waived 
from time to time  for valid business reasons based on the facts and circumstances  authorization has been granted to allow specific commodity risk management positions to exceed established limits 
if we sustain material losses from our risk management activities due to our failure to anticipate future events  a failure of the policy  incorrect waivers or otherwise  our ability to make distributions to our unitholders or pay interest or principal of any debt securities may be negatively impacted as a result of such loss 
we are dependent on our principal suppliers  which increases the risks from an interruption in supply and transportation 
through our supply procurement activities  we purchased approximately of our propane from six suppliers during fiscal in addition  during extended periods of colder than normal weather  suppliers may temporarily run out of propane necessitating the transportation of propane by truck  rail car or other means from other areas 
if supplies from these sources were interrupted or difficulties in alternative transportation were to arise  the cost of procuring replacement supplies and transporting those supplies from alternative locations might be materially higher and  at least on a short term basis  our margins could be reduced 
the availability of cash from our credit facility may be impacted by many factors beyond our control 
we typically borrow on the operating partnership s credit facility or sell accounts receivable under its accounts receivable securitization facility to fund our working capital requirements 
we may also borrow on the operating partnership s credit facility to fund debt service payments  distributions to our unitholders  acquisition and capital expenditures 
we purchase product from suppliers and make payments with terms that are typically within five to ten days of delivery 
we believe that the availability of cash from the operating partnership s credit facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility will be sufficient to meet our future working capital needs 
however  if we were to experience an unexpected significant increase in working capital requirements or have insufficient funds to fund distributions  this need could 
table of contents exceed our immediately available resources 
events that could cause increases in working capital borrowings or letter of credit requirements may include a significant increase in the wholesale cost of propane  a significant delay in the collections of accounts receivable  increased volatility in energy commodity prices related to risk management activities  increased liquidity requirements imposed by insurance providers  a significant downgrade in our credit rating leading to decreased trade credit  or a significant acquisition 
as is typical in our industry  our retail customers do not pay upon receipt  but generally pay between and days after delivery 
during the winter heating season  we experience significant increases in accounts receivable and inventory levels and thus a significant decline in working capital availability 
although we have the ability to fund working capital with borrowings from the operating partnership s credit facility and sales of accounts receivable under its accounts receivable securitization facility  we cannot predict the effect that increases in propane prices and colder than normal winter weather may have on future working capital availability 
we may not be successful in making acquisitions and any acquisitions we make may not result in our anticipated results  in either case  this would potentially limit our growth  limit our ability to compete and impair our results of operations 
we have historically expanded our business through acquisitions 
we regularly consider and evaluate opportunities to acquire local  regional and national propane distributors 
we may choose to finance these acquisitions through internal cash flow  external borrowings or the issuance of additional common units or other securities 
we have substantial competition for acquisitions of propane companies 
although we believe there are numerous potential large and small acquisition candidates in our industry  there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire any of these candidates on economically acceptable terms  we will be able to successfully integrate acquired operations with any expected cost savings  any acquisitions made will not be dilutive to our earnings and distributions  any additional equity we issue as consideration for an acquisition will not be dilutive to our unitholders  or any additional debt we incur to finance an acquisition will not affect the operating partnership s ability to make distributions to ferrellgas partners or service the operating partnership s existing debt 
we are subject to operating and litigation risks  which may not be covered by insurance 
our operations are subject to all operating hazards and risks normally incidental to the handling  storing and delivering of combustible liquids such as propane 
as a result  we have been  and are likely to be  a defendant in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
we will maintain insurance policies with insurers in such amounts and with such coverages and deductibles as we believe are reasonable and prudent 
however  we cannot guarantee that such insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal injury and property damage or that such levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices 
we depend on particular management information systems to effectively manage all aspects of our delivery of propane 
we depend on our management information systems to process orders  manage inventory and accounts receivable collections  maintain distributor and customer information  maintain cost efficient operations and assist in delivering propane on a timely basis 
in addition  our staff of management information systems professionals relies heavily on the support of several key personnel and vendors 
any disruption in the operation of those management information systems  loss of employees knowledgeable about such systems  termination of our relationship with one or more of these key vendors or failure to 
table of contents continue to modify such systems effectively as our business expands could negatively affect our business 
risks inherent to an investment in our debt securities ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership are required to distribute all of their available cash to their equity holders and ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership are not required to accumulate cash for the purpose of meeting their future obligations to holders of their debt securities  which may limit the cash available to service those debt securities 
subject to the limitations on restricted payments contained in the indenture that governs ferrellgas partners outstanding notes  the instruments governing the outstanding indebtedness of the operating partnership and any applicable indenture that will govern any debt securities ferrellgas partners or the operating partnership may issue  the partnership agreements of both ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership require us to distribute all of our available cash each fiscal quarter to our limited partners and our general partner and do not require us to accumulate cash for the purpose of meeting obligations to holders of any debt securities of ferrellgas partners or the operating partnership 
available cash is generally all of our cash receipts  less cash disbursements and adjustments for net changes in reserves 
as a result of these distribution requirements  we do not expect either ferrellgas partners or the operating partnership to accumulate significant amounts of cash 
depending on the timing and amount of our cash distributions and because we are not required to accumulate cash for the purpose of meeting obligations to holders of any debt securities of ferrellgas partners or the operating partnership  such distributions could significantly reduce the cash available to us in subsequent periods to make payments on any debt securities of ferrellgas partners or the operating partnership 
debt securities of ferrellgas partners will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of the operating partnership and its subsidiaries 
debt securities of ferrellgas partners will be effectively subordinated to all existing and future claims of creditors of the operating partnership and its subsidiaries  including the lenders under the operating partnership s indebtedness  the claims of lessors under the operating partnership s operating leases  the claims of the lenders and their affiliates under the operating partnership s accounts receivable securitization facility  debt securities  including any subordinated debt securities  issued by the operating partnership  and all other possible future creditors of the operating partnership and its subsidiaries 
this subordination is due to these creditors priority as to the assets of the operating partnership and its subsidiaries over ferrellgas partners claims as an equity holder in the operating partnership and  thereby  indirectly  the claims of holders of ferrellgas partners debt securities 
as a result  upon any distribution to these creditors in a bankruptcy  liquidation or reorganization or similar proceeding relating to ferrellgas partners or its property  the operating partnership s creditors will be entitled to be paid in full before any payment may be made with respect to ferrellgas partners debt securities 
thereafter  the holders of ferrellgas partners debt securities will participate with its trade creditors and all other holders of its indebtedness in the assets remaining  if any 
in any of these cases  ferrellgas partners may have insufficient funds to pay all of its creditors  and holders of its debt securities may therefore receive less  ratably  than creditors of the operating partnership and its subsidiaries 
as of july   the operating partnership had approximately  million of outstanding indebtedness and other liabilities to which any of the debt securities of ferrellgas partners will effectively rank junior 
all payments on any subordinated debt securities that we may issue will be subordinated to the payments of any amounts due on any senior indebtedness that we may have issued or incurred 
the right of the holders of subordinated debt securities to receive payment of any amounts due to them  whether interest  premium or principal  will be subordinated to the right of all of the holders of our senior indebtedness  as such term will be defined in the applicable subordinated debt indenture  to receive payments of all amounts due to them 
if an event of default on any of our senior indebtedness occurs  then until such event of default has been cured  we may be unable to make payments of any amounts due 
table of contents to the holders of our subordinated debt securities 
accordingly  in the event of insolvency  creditors who are holders of our senior indebtedness may recover more  ratably  than the holders of our subordinated debt securities 
debt securities of ferrellgas partners are expected to be non recourse to the operating partnership  which will limit remedies of the holders of ferrellgas partners debt securities 
ferrellgas partners obligations under any debt securities are expected to be non recourse to the operating partnership 
therefore  if ferrellgas partners should fail to pay the interest or principal on the notes or breach any of its other obligations under its debt securities or any applicable indenture  holders of debt securities of ferrellgas partners will not be able to obtain any such payments or obtain any other remedy from the operating partnership or its subsidiaries 
the operating partnership and its subsidiaries will not be liable for any of ferrellgas partners obligations under its debt securities or the applicable indenture 
ferrellgas partners or the operating partnership may be unable to repurchase debt securities upon a change of control  it may be difficult to determine if a change of control has occurred 
upon the occurrence of change of control events as may be described from time to time in our filings with the sec and related to the issuance by ferrellgas partners or the operating partnership of debt securities  the applicable issuer or a third party may be required to make a change of control offer to repurchase those debt securities at a premium to their principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the applicable issuer may not have the financial resources to purchase its debt securities in that circumstance  particularly if a change of control event triggers a similar repurchase requirement for  or results in the acceleration of  other indebtedness 
the indenture governing ferrellgas partners outstanding notes contains such a repurchase requirement 
some of the agreements governing the operating partnership s indebtedness currently provide that specified change of control events will result in the acceleration of the indebtedness under those agreements 
future debt agreements of ferrellgas partners or the operating partnership may also contain similar provisions 
the obligation to repay any accelerated indebtedness of the operating partnership will be structurally senior to ferrellgas partners obligations to repurchase its debt securities upon a change of control 
in addition  future debt agreements of ferrellgas partners or the operating partnership may contain other restrictions on the ability of ferrellgas partners or the operating partnership to repurchase its debt securities upon a change of control 
these restrictions could prevent the applicable issuer from satisfying its obligations to purchase its debt securities unless it is able to refinance or obtain waivers under any indebtedness of ferrellgas partners or of the operating partnership containing these restrictions 
the applicable issuer s failure to make or consummate a change of control repurchase offer or pay the change of control purchase price when due may give the trustee and the holders of the debt securities particular rights as may be described from time to time in our filings with the sec 
in addition  one of the events that may constitute a change of control is a sale of all or substantially all of the applicable issuer s assets 
the meaning of substantially all varies according to the facts and circumstances of the subject transaction and has no clearly established meaning under new york law  which is the law that will likely govern any indenture for the debt securities 
this ambiguity as to when a sale of substantially all of the applicable issuer s assets has occurred may make it difficult for holders of debt securities to determine whether the applicable issuer has properly identified  or failed to identify  a change of control 
there may be no active trading market for our debt securities  which may limit a holder s ability to sell our debt securities 
we do not intend to list the debt securities we may issue from time to time on any securities exchange or to seek approval for quotations through any automated quotation system 
an established market for the debt securities may not develop  or if one does develop  it may not be maintained 
although underwriters may advise us that they intend to make a market in the debt securities  they are not expected to be obligated to do so and may discontinue such market making activity at any time without notice

table of contents market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the securities act and the exchange act 
for these reasons  we cannot assure a debt holder that a liquid market for the debt securities will develop  a debt holder will be able to sell its debt securities  or a debt holder will receive any specific price upon any sale of its debt securities 
if a public market for the debt securities did develop  the debt securities could trade at prices that may be higher or lower than their principal amount or purchase price  depending on many factors  including prevailing interest rates  the market for similar debt securities and our financial performance 
historically  the market for non investment grade debt  such as our debt securities  has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial fluctuations in the prices of these securities 
risks inherent to an investment in ferrellgas partners equity ferrellgas partners may sell additional limited partner interests  diluting existing interests of unitholders 
the partnership agreement of ferrellgas partners generally allows ferrellgas partners to issue additional limited partner interests and other equity securities 
when ferrellgas partners issues additional equity securities  a unitholder s proportionate partnership interest will decrease 
such an issuance could negatively affect the amount of cash distributed to unitholders and the market price of common units 
the issuance of additional common units will also diminish the relative voting strength of the previously outstanding common units 
cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate with our performance and other external factors 
although we are required to distribute all of our available cash  we cannot guarantee the amounts of available cash that will be distributed to the holders of our equity securities 
available cash is generally all of our cash receipts  less cash disbursements and adjustments for net changes in reserves 
the actual amounts of available cash will depend upon numerous factors  including cash flow generated by operations  weather in our areas of operation  borrowing capacity under our credit facility  principal and interest payments made on our debt  the costs of acquisitions  including related debt service payments  restrictions contained in debt instruments  issuances of debt and equity securities  fluctuations in working capital  capital expenditures  adjustments in reserves made by our general partner in its discretion  prevailing economic conditions  and financial  business and other factors  a number of which will be beyond our control 
cash distributions are dependent primarily on cash flow  including from reserves and  subject to limitations  working capital borrowings 
cash distributions are not dependent on profitability  which is affected by non cash items 
therefore  cash distributions might be made during periods when we record losses and might not be made during periods when we record profits 

table of contents our general partner has broad discretion to determine the amount of available cash for distribution to holders of our equity securities through the establishment and maintenance of cash reserves  thereby potentially lessening and limiting the amount of available cash eligible for distribution 
our general partner determines the timing and amount of our distributions and has broad discretion in determining the amount of funds that will be recognized as available cash 
part of this discretion comes from the ability of our general partner to establish and make additions to our reserves 
decisions as to amounts to be placed in or released from reserves have a direct impact on the amount of available cash for distributions because increases and decreases in reserves are taken into account in computing available cash 
funds within or added to our reserves are not considered to be available cash and are therefore not required to be distributed 
each fiscal quarter  our general partner may  in its reasonable discretion  determine the amounts to be placed in or released from reserves  subject to restrictions on the purposes of the reserves 
reserves may be made  increased or decreased for any proper purpose  including  but not limited to  reserves to comply with the terms of any of our agreements or obligations  including the establishment of reserves to fund the payment of interest and principal in the future of any debt securities of ferrellgas partners or the operating partnership  to provide for level distributions of cash notwithstanding the seasonality of our business  and to provide for future capital expenditures and other payments deemed by our general partner to be necessary or advisable 
the decision by our general partner to establish  increase or decrease our reserves may limit the amount of cash available for distribution to holders of our equity securities 
holders of our equity securities will not receive payments required by such securities unless we are able to first satisfy our own obligations and the establishment of any reserves 
see the first risk factor under risks arising from our partnership structure and relationship with our general partner 
the debt agreements of ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership may limit their ability to make distributions to holders of their equity securities 
the debt agreements governing ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership s outstanding indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that may limit or prohibit distributions to holders of their equity securities under various circumstances 
ferrellgas partners existing indenture generally prohibits it from making any distributions to unitholders if an event of default exists or would exist when such distribution is made  distributing amounts in excess of of available cash for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter if its consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the indenture is less than to  or distributing amounts in excess of million less any restricted payments made for the prior sixteen fiscal quarters plus the aggregate cash contributions made to us during that period if its consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the indenture is less than or equal to to 
see the first risk factor under risks arising from our partnership structure and relationship with our general partner for a description of the restrictions on the operating partnership s ability to distribute cash to ferrellgas partners 
any indenture applicable to future issuances of debt securities by ferrellgas partners or the operating partnership may contain restrictions that are the same as or similar to those in their existing debt agreements 
persons owning or more of ferrellgas partners common units cannot vote 
this limitation does not apply to common units owned by ferrell companies  our general partner and its affiliates 
all common units held by a person that owns or more of ferrellgas partners common units cannot be voted 
this provision may discourage a person or group from attempting to remove our general partner or otherwise change management  and reduce the price at which our common units will trade under various circumstances

risks arising from our partnership structure and relationship with our general partner ferrellgas partners is a holding entity and has no material operations or assets 
accordingly  ferrellgas partners is dependent on distributions from the operating partnership to service its obligations 
these distributions are not guaranteed and may be restricted 
ferrellgas partners is a holding entity for our subsidiaries  including the operating partnership 
ferrellgas partners has no material operations and only limited assets 
ferrellgas partners finance corp 
is ferrellgas partners wholly owned finance subsidiary  serves as a co obligor on any of its debt securities  conducts no business and has nominal assets 
accordingly  ferrellgas partners is dependent on cash distributions from the operating partnership and its subsidiaries to service obligations of ferrellgas partners 
the operating partnership is required to distribute all of its available cash each fiscal quarter  less the amount of cash reserves that our general partner determines is necessary or appropriate in its reasonable discretion to provide for the proper conduct of our business  to provide funds for distributions over the next four fiscal quarters or to comply with applicable law or with any of our debt or other agreements 
this discretion may limit the amount of available cash the operating partnership may distribute to ferrellgas partners each fiscal quarter 
holders of ferrellgas partners securities will not receive payments required by those securities unless the operating partnership is able to make distributions to ferrellgas partners after the operating partnership first satisfies its obligations under the terms of its own borrowing arrangements and reserves any necessary amounts to meet its own financial obligations 
in addition  the various agreements governing the operating partnership s indebtedness and other financing transactions permit quarterly distributions only so long as each distribution does not exceed a specified amount  the operating partnership meets a specified financial ratio and no default exists or would result from such distribution 
those agreements include the indentures governing the operating partnership s existing notes  credit facility and an accounts receivable securitization facility 
each of these agreements contains various negative and affirmative covenants applicable to the operating partnership and some of these agreements require the operating partnership to maintain specified financial ratios 
if the operating partnership violates any of these covenants or requirements  a default may result and distributions would be limited 
these covenants limit the operating partnership s ability to  among other things incur additional indebtedness  engage in transactions with affiliates  create or incur liens  sell assets  make restricted payments  loans and investments  enter into business combinations and asset sale transactions  and engage in other lines of business 
unitholders have limits on their voting rights  our general partner manages and operates us  thereby generally precluding the participation of our unitholders in operational decisions 
our general partner manages and operates us 
unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation  unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business 
amendments to the agreement of limited partnership of ferrellgas partners may be proposed only by or with the consent of our general partner 
proposed amendments must generally be approved by holders of at least a majority of our outstanding common units 
unitholders will have no right to elect our general partner  or any directors of our general partner on an annual or other continuing basis  nor will any proxies be received for such voting 
our general partner may not be removed except pursuant to 
table of contents the vote of the holders of at least of the outstanding units entitled to vote thereon  which includes the common units owned by our general partner and its affiliates  and upon the election of a successor general partner by the vote of the holders of not less than a majority of the outstanding common units entitled to vote 
because ferrell companies is the parent of our general partner and beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding common units and james e 
ferrell  executive chairman and chairman of the board of directors of our general partner  indirectly owns approximately of our outstanding common units  amendments to the agreement of limited partnership of ferrellgas partners or the removal of our general partner are unlikely if neither ferrell companies nor mr 
ferrell consent to such action 
our general partner has a limited call right with respect to the limited partner interests of ferrellgas partners 
if at any time less than of the then issued and outstanding limited partner interests of any class of ferrellgas partners are held by persons other than our general partner and its affiliates  our general partner has the right  which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us  to acquire all  but not less than all  of the remaining limited partner interests of such class held by such unaffiliated persons at a price generally equal to the then current market price of limited partner interests of such class 
as a consequence  a unitholder may be required to sell its common units at a time when the unitholder may not desire to sell them or at a price that is less than the price desired to be received upon such sale 
unitholders may not have limited liability in specified circumstances and may be liable for the return of distributions 
the limitations on the liability of holders of limited partner interests for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established in some states 
if it were determined that we had been conducting business in any state without compliance with the applicable limited partnership statute  or that the right  or the exercise of the right by the limited partners as a group  to remove or replace our general partner  make specified amendments to our partnership agreements  or take other action pursuant to our partnership agreements that constitutes participation in the control of our business  then the limited partners could be held liable in some circumstances for our obligations to the same extent as a general partner 
in addition  under some circumstances a unitholder may be liable to us for the amount of a distribution for a period of three years from the date of the distribution 
unitholders will not be liable for assessments in addition to their initial capital investment in our common units 
under delaware general corporate law  we may not make a distribution to our unitholders if the distribution causes all our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets 
liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities for which recourse is limited to specific property are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted 
delaware law provides that a limited partner who receives such a distribution and knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution violated the delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount for three years from the distribution date 
under delaware law  an assignee that becomes a substituted limited partner of a limited partnership is liable for the obligations of the assignor to make contributions to the partnership 
however  such an assignee is not obligated for liabilities unknown to that assignee at the time such assignee became a limited partner if the liabilities could not be determined from the partnership agreements 

table of contents our general partner s liability to us and our unitholders may be limited 
the partnership agreements of ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership contain language limiting the liability of our general partner to us and to our unitholders 
for example  those partnership agreements provide that the general partner does not breach any duty to us or our unitholders by borrowing funds or approving any borrowing  our general partner is protected even if the purpose or effect of the borrowing is to increase incentive distributions to our general partner  our general partner does not breach any duty to us or our unitholders by taking any actions consistent with the standards of reasonable discretion outlined in the definitions of available cash and cash from operations contained in our partnership agreements  and our general partner does not breach any standard of care or duty by resolving conflicts of interest unless our general partner acts in bad faith 
the modifications of state law standards of fiduciary duty contained in our partnership agreements may significantly limit the ability of unitholders to successfully challenge the actions of our general partner as being a breach of what would otherwise have been a fiduciary duty 
these standards include the highest duties of good faith  fairness and loyalty to the limited partners 
such a duty of loyalty would generally prohibit a general partner of a delaware limited partnership from taking any action or engaging in any transaction for which it has a conflict of interest 
under our partnership agreements  our general partner may exercise its broad discretion and authority in our management and the conduct of our operations as long as our general partner s actions are in our best interest 
our general partner and its affiliates may have conflicts with us 
the directors and officers of our general partner and its affiliates have fiduciary duties to manage itself in a manner that is beneficial to its stockholder 
at the same time  our general partner has fiduciary duties to manage us in a manner that is beneficial to us and our unitholders 
therefore  our general partner s duties to us may conflict with the duties of its officers and directors to its stockholder 
matters in which  and reasons that  such conflicts of interest may arise include decisions of our general partner with respect to the amount and timing of our cash expenditures  borrowings  acquisitions  issuances of additional securities and changes in reserves in any quarter may affect the amount of incentive distributions we are obligated to pay our general partner  borrowings do not constitute a breach of any duty owed by our general partner to our unitholders even if these borrowings have the purpose or effect of directly or indirectly enabling us to make distributions to the holder of our incentive distribution rights  currently our general partner  we do not have any employees and rely solely on employees of our general partner and its affiliates  under the terms of our partnership agreements  we must reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for costs incurred in managing and operating us  including costs incurred in rendering corporate staff and support services to us  our general partner is not restricted from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered on terms that are fair and reasonable to us or causing us to enter into additional contractual arrangements with any of such entities  neither our partnership agreements nor any of the other agreements  contracts and arrangements between us  on the one hand  and our general partner and its affiliates  on the other  are or will be the result of arms length negotiations  whenever possible  our general partner limits our liability under contractual arrangements to all or a portion of our assets  with the other party thereto having no recourse against our general partner or its assets  our partnership agreements permit our general partner to make these limitations even if we could have obtained more favorable terms if our general partner had not limited its liability  
table of contents any agreements between us and our general partner or its affiliates will not grant to our unitholders  separate and apart from us  the right to enforce the obligations of our general partner or such affiliates in favor of us  therefore  our general partner will be primarily responsible for enforcing those obligations  our general partner may exercise its right to call for and purchase common units as provided in the partnership agreement of ferrellgas partners or assign that right to one of its affiliates or to us  our partnership agreements provide that it will not constitute a breach of our general partner s fiduciary duties to us for its affiliates to engage in activities of the type conducted by us  other than retail propane sales to end users in the continental united states in the manner engaged in by our general partner immediately prior to our initial public offering  even if these activities are in direct competition with us  our general partner and its affiliates have no obligation to present business opportunities to us  our general partner selects the attorneys  accountants and others who perform services for us 
these persons may also perform services for our general partner and its affiliates 
our general partner is authorized to retain separate counsel for us or our unitholders  depending on the nature of the conflict that arises  and james e 
ferrell is the executive chairman of our general partner and the chairman of its board of directors 
mr 
ferrell also owns other companies with whom we may  from time to time  conduct transactions within our ordinary course of business 
mr 
ferrell s ownership of these entities may conflict with his duties as an officer and director of our general partner  including our relationship and conduct of business with any of mr 
ferrell s companies 
see conflicts of interest and fiduciary responsibilities below 
ferrell companies may transfer the ownership of our general partner which could cause a change of our management and affect the decisions made by our general partner regarding resolutions of conflicts of interest 
ferrell companies  the owner of our general partner  may transfer the capital stock of our general partner without the consent of our unitholders 
in such an instance  our general partner will remain bound by our partnership agreements 
if  however  through share ownership or otherwise  persons not now affiliated with our general partner were to acquire its general partner interest in us or effective control of our general partner  our management and resolutions of conflicts of interest  such as those described above  could change substantially 
our general partner may voluntarily withdraw or sell its general partner interest 
our general partner may withdraw as the general partner of ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership without the approval of our unitholders 
our general partner may also sell its general partner interest in ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership without the approval of our unitholders 
any such withdrawal or sale could have a material adverse effect on us and could substantially change the management and resolutions of conflicts of interest  as described above 
our general partner can protect itself against dilution 
whenever we issue equity securities to any person other than our general partner and its affiliates  our general partner has the right to purchase additional limited partner interests on the same terms 
this allows our general partner to maintain its partnership interest in us 
no other unitholder has a similar right 
therefore  only our general partner may protect itself against dilution caused by our issuance of additional equity securities 

table of contents tax risks the irs could treat us as a corporation for tax purposes or changes in federal or state laws could subject us to entity level taxation  which would substantially reduce the cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
the anticipated after tax economic benefit of an investment in us depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
we believe that  under current law  we have been and will continue to be classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
one of the requirements for such classification is that at least of our gross income for each taxable year has been and will be qualifying income within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code 
whether we will continue to be classified as a partnership in part depends on our ability to meet this qualifying income test in the future 
if we were classified as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  we would pay tax on our income at corporate rates  currently at the federal level  and we would probably pay additional state income taxes as well 
in addition  distributions would generally be taxable to the recipient as corporate dividends and no income  gains  losses or deductions would flow through to our unitholders 
because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation  the cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced 
therefore  treatment of us as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after tax return to our unitholders and thus would likely result in a substantial reduction in the value of our common units 
a change in current law or a change in our business could cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to entity level taxation 
our partnership agreements provide that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity level taxation for federal  state or local income tax purposes  provisions of our partnership agreements will be subject to change 
these changes would include a decrease in the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels to reflect the impact of such law on us 
a successful irs contest of the federal income tax positions we take may reduce the market value of our common units and the costs of any contest will be borne by us and therefore indirectly by our unitholders and our general partner 
the irs may adopt positions that differ from those expressed herein or from the positions we take 
it may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings in an effort to sustain some or all of the positions we take  and some or all of these positions ultimately may not be sustained 
any contest with the irs may materially reduce the market value of our common units and the prices at which our common units trade 
in addition  our costs of any contest with the irs will be borne by us and therefore indirectly by our unitholders and our general partner 
unitholders may be required to pay taxes on income from us even if unitholders do not receive any cash distributions from us 
a unitholder will be required to pay federal income taxes and  in some cases  state and local income taxes on its share of our taxable income  even if it does not receive cash distributions from us 
a unitholder may not receive cash distributions equal to its share of our taxable income or even the tax liability that results from that income 
further  a unitholder may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash it receives upon the sale of its units 
the ratio of taxable income to cash distributions could be higher or lower than our estimates  which could result in a material reduction of the market value of our common units 
we estimate that a person who acquires common units in the calendar year and owns those common units through the record dates for all cash distributions payable for all periods within the calendar year will be allocated  on a cumulative basis  an amount of federal taxable income that will be less than of the cumulative cash distributed to such person for those periods 
the taxable income allocable to a unitholder for subsequent periods may constitute an increasing percentage of distributable cash 
these estimates are based on several assumptions and estimates that are subject to factors 
table of contents beyond our control 
accordingly  the actual percentage of distributions that will constitute taxable income could be higher or lower and any differences could result in a material reduction in the market value of our common units 
there are limits on the deductibility of losses 
in the case of unitholders subject to the passive loss rules generally  individuals  closely held corporations and regulated investment companies  any losses generated by us will only be available to offset our future income and cannot be used to offset income from other activities  including passive activities or investments 
unused losses may be deducted when the unitholder disposes of its entire investment in us in a fully taxable transaction with an unrelated party 
a unitholder s share of our net passive income may be offset by unused losses carried over from prior years  but not by losses from other passive activities  including losses from other publicly traded partnerships 
tax gain or loss on the disposition of our common units could be different than expected 
if a unitholder sells their common units  the unitholder will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and its tax basis in those common units 
prior distributions in excess of the total net taxable income the unitholder was allocated for a common unit  which decreased its tax basis in that common unit  will  in effect  become taxable income to the unitholder if the common unit is sold at a price greater than its tax basis in that common unit  even if the price received is less than its original cost 
a substantial portion of the amount realized  whether or not representing a gain  will likely be ordinary income to that unitholder 
should the irs successfully contest some positions we take  a selling unitholder could recognize more gain on the sale of units than would be the case under those positions  without the benefit of decreased income in prior years 
in addition  if a unitholder sells its units  the unitholder may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash that unitholder receives from the sale 
tax exempt entities  regulated investment companies  and foreign persons face unique tax issues from owning common units that may result in additional tax liability or reporting requirements for them 
an investment in common units by tax exempt entities  such as employee benefit plans  individual retirement accounts  regulated investment companies  generally known as mutual funds  and non us persons  raises issues unique to them 
for example  virtually all of our income allocated to organizations exempt from federal income tax  including individual retirement accounts and other retirement plans  will be unrelated business taxable income and thus will be taxable to them 
net income from a qualified publicly traded partnership is qualifying income for a regulated investment company  or mutual fund 
however  no more than of the value of a regulated investment company s total assets may be invested in the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships 
we expect to be treated as a qualified publicly traded partnership 
distributions to non us persons will be reduced by withholding taxes  at the highest effective tax rate applicable to individuals  and non us persons will be required to file federal income tax returns and generally pay tax on their share of our taxable income 
certain information relating to a unitholder s investment may be subject to special irs reporting requirements 
treasury regulations require taxpayers to report particular information on form if they participate in a reportable transaction 
unitholders may be required to file this form with the irs 
a transaction may be a reportable transaction based upon any of several factors 
the irs may impose significant penalties on a unitholder for failure to comply with these disclosure requirements 
disclosure and information maintenance obligations are also imposed on material advisors that organize  manage or sell interests in reportable transactions  which may require us or our material advisors to maintain and disclose to the irs certain information relating to unitholders 
an audit of us may result in an adjustment or an audit of a unitholder s own tax return 
we may be audited by the irs and tax adjustments could be made 
the rights of a unitholder owning less than a interest in us to participate in the income tax audit process are very limited 
further  any 
table of contents adjustments in our tax returns will lead to adjustments in the unitholders tax returns and may lead to audits of unitholders tax returns and adjustments of items unrelated to us 
a unitholder will bear the cost of any expenses incurred in connection with an examination of its personal tax return 
reporting of partnership tax information is complicated and subject to audits  we cannot guarantee conformity to irs requirements 
we will furnish each unitholder with a schedule k that sets forth that unitholder s allocable share of income  gains  losses and deductions 
in preparing these schedules  we will use various accounting and reporting conventions and adopt various depreciation and amortization methods 
we cannot guarantee that these schedules will yield a result that conforms to statutory or regulatory requirements or to administrative pronouncements of the irs 
if any of the information on these schedules is successfully challenged by the irs  the character and amount of items of income  gain  loss or deduction previously reported by unitholders might change  and unitholders might be required to adjust their tax liability for prior years and incur interest and penalties with respect to those adjustments 
unitholders may lose tax benefits as a result of nonconforming depreciation conventions 
because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units  uniformity of the economic and tax characteristics of our common units to a purchaser of common units of the same class must be maintained 
to maintain uniformity and for other reasons  we have adopted certain depreciation and amortization conventions which we believe conform to treasury regulations under b of the internal revenue code 
a successful irs challenge to those positions could reduce the amount of tax benefits available to our unitholders 
a successful challenge could also affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from the sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to a unitholder s tax returns 
as a result of investing in our common units  a unitholder will likely be subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in jurisdictions where it does not live 
in addition to federal income taxes  unitholders will likely be subject to other taxes  such as state and local taxes  unincorporated business taxes and estate  inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we do business or own property 
a unitholder will likely be required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of the various jurisdictions in which we do business or own property and may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements 
we currently conduct business in all states  the district of columbia and puerto rico 
it is a unitholder s responsibility to file all required united states federal  state and local tax returns 
states may subject partnerships to entity level taxation in the future  thereby decreasing the amount of cash available to us for distributions and potentially causing a decrease in our distribution levels  including a decrease in the minimum quarterly distribution 
several states have enacted or are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income  franchise or other forms of taxation 
if additional states were to impose a tax upon us as an entity  the cash available for distribution to unitholders would be reduced 
the partnership agreements of ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership each provide that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects one or both partnerships to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects one or both partnerships to entity level taxation for federal  state or local income tax purposes  provisions of one or both partnership agreements will be subject to change 
these changes would include a decrease in the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels to reflect the impact of those taxes 

table of contents unitholders may have negative tax consequences if we default on our debt or sell assets 
if we default on any of our debt  the lenders will have the right to sue us for non payment 
that action could cause an investment loss and negative tax consequences for our unitholders through the realization of taxable income by unitholders without a corresponding cash distribution 
likewise  if we were to dispose of assets and realize a taxable gain while there is substantial debt outstanding and proceeds of the sale were applied to the debt  our unitholders could have increased taxable income without a corresponding cash distribution 
conflicts of interest conflicts of interest could arise as a result of the relationships between us  on the one hand  and our general partner and its affiliates  on the other 
the directors and officers of our general partner have fiduciary duties to manage our general partner in a manner beneficial to its stockholder 
at the same time  our general partner has fiduciary duties to manage us in a manner beneficial to us and our unitholders

fiduciary responsibilities unless otherwise provided for in a partnership agreement  delaware law generally requires a general partner of a delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith  fairness and loyalty and which generally prohibit the general partner from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest 
our partnership agreements expressly permit our general partner to resolve conflicts of interest between itself or its affiliates  on the one hand  and us or our unitholders  on the other  and to consider  in resolving such conflicts of interest  the interests of other parties in addition to the interests of our unitholders 
in addition  the partnership agreement of ferrellgas partners provides that a purchaser of common units is deemed to have consented to specified conflicts of interest and actions of our general partner and its affiliates that might otherwise be prohibited  including those described above  and to have agreed that such conflicts of interest and actions do not constitute a breach by our general partner of any duty stated or implied by law or equity

other than as discussed below  we are not a party to any legal proceedings other than various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business 
it is not possible to determine the ultimate disposition of these matters  however  management is of the opinion that there are no known claims or contingent claims that are reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits filed in multiple federal and state courts that seek to certify nationwide or statewide classes related to our blue rhino branded propane tank exchange activities 
the plaintiffs in each case generally allege that we failed to inform consumers of the amount of propane contained in propane tanks they purchased and that we violated anti trust laws by allegedly conspiring with a competitor 
the federal cases have been coordinated for multidistrict treatment in the united states district court for the western district of missouri 
we believe these claims will not have a material impact beyond the million litigation accrual established for these claims during the current year period

accordingly  and due to the reduced disclosure format  a discussion of the results of operations  liquidity and capital resources of ferrellgas partners finance corp 
and ferrellgas finance corp 
is not presented in this section 
the following is a discussion of our historical financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the discussions set forth in the results of operations and liquidity and capital resources sections generally refer to ferrellgas partners and its consolidated subsidiaries 
however  in these discussions there exist two material differences between ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership 
those material differences are because ferrellgas partners has outstanding million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due fiscal  the two partnerships incur different amounts of interest expense on their outstanding indebtedness  see the statements of earnings in their respective consolidated financial statements and note h debt in the respective notes to their consolidated financial statements  and ferrellgas partners issued common units during both fiscal and overview we are a leading distributor of propane and related equipment and supplies to customers primarily in the united states and conduct our business as a single reportable operating segment 
we believe that we are the second largest retail marketer of propane in the united states as measured by the volume of our retail sales in fiscal  and the largest national provider of propane by portable tank exchange 
we serve approximately one million residential  industrial commercial  portable tank exchange  agricultural  wholesale and other customers in all states  the district of columbia and puerto rico 
our operations primarily include the distribution and sale of propane and related equipment and supplies with concentrations in the midwest  southeast  southwest and northwest regions of the united states 
our propane distribution business consists principally of transporting propane purchased from third parties to propane distribution locations and then to tanks on customers premises or to portable propane tanks delivered to nationwide and local retailers 
our portable tank exchange operations  nationally branded under the name blue rhino  are conducted through a network of independent and partnership owned distribution outlets 
our market areas for our residential and agricultural customers are generally rural  while our market areas for our industrial commercial and portable tank exchange customers is generally urban 

table of contents in the residential and industrial commercial markets  propane is primarily used for space heating  water heating  cooking and other propane fueled appliances 
in the portable tank exchange market  propane is used primarily for outdoor cooking using gas grills 
in the agricultural market  propane is primarily used for crop drying  space heating  irrigation and weed control 
in addition  propane is used for a variety of industrial applications  including as an engine fuel which is burned in internal combustion engines that power vehicles and forklifts  and as a heating or energy source in manufacturing and drying processes 
the market for propane is seasonal because of increased demand during the months of november through march the winter heating season primarily for the purpose of providing heating in residential and commercial buildings 
consequently  sales and operating profits are concentrated in our second and third fiscal quarters  which are during the winter heating season 
however  our propane by portable tank exchanges sales volume provides us increased operating profits during our first and fourth fiscal quarters due to its counter seasonal business activities 
these sales also provide us the ability to better utilize our seasonal resources at our propane distribution locations 
other factors affecting our results of operations include competitive conditions  volatility in energy commodity prices  demand for propane  timing of acquisitions and general economic conditions in the united states 
we use information on temperatures to understand how our results of operations are affected by temperatures that are warmer or colder than normal 
we use the definition of normal temperatures based on information published by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
based on this information we calculate a ratio of actual heating degree days to normal heating degree days 
heating degree days are a general indicator of weather impacting propane usage 
weather conditions have a significant impact on demand for propane for heating purposes during the winter heating season 
accordingly  the volume of propane used by our customers for this purpose is affected by the severity of the winter weather in the regions we serve and can vary substantially from year to year 
in any given region  sustained warmer than normal temperatures will tend to result in reduced propane usage  while sustained colder than normal temperatures will tend to result in greater usage 
although there is a strong correlation between weather and customer usage  general economic conditions in the united states and the wholesale price of propane can have a significant impact on this correlation 
additionally  there is a natural time lag between the onset of cold weather and increased sales to customers 
if the united states were to experience a cooling trend  we could expect nationwide demand for propane to increase which could lead to greater sales  income and liquidity availability 
conversely  if the united states were to experience a warming trend  we could expect nationwide demand for propane to decrease which could lead to a reduction in our sales  income and liquidity availability 
our gross margin from the retail distribution of propane is primarily based on the cents per gallon difference between the sale price we charge our customers and our costs to purchase and deliver propane to our propane distribution locations 
our residential customers and portable tank exchange customers typically provide us a greater cents per gallon margin than our industrial commercial  agricultural  wholesale and other customers 
we track propane sales volumes  revenues propane and other gas liquids sales and gross margin propane and other gas liquids sales by customer  however  we are not able to specifically allocate operating and other costs in a manner that would determine their specific profitability with a high degree of accuracy 
the wholesale propane price per gallon is subject to various market conditions  including inflation  and may fluctuate based on changes in demand  supply and other energy commodity prices  primarily crude oil and natural gas  as propane prices tend to correlate with the fluctuations of these underlying commodities 
we employ risk management activities that attempt to mitigate price risks related to the purchase  storage  transport and sale of propane 
we enter into propane sales commitments with a portion of our customers that provide for a contracted price agreement for a specified period of time 
these commitments can expose us to product price risk if not immediately economically hedged with an offsetting propane purchase commitment 

table of contents our open financial derivative purchase commitments are designated as hedges primarily for fiscal sales commitments and  as of july   have experienced net mark to market gains of approximately million 
because these financial derivative purchase commitments qualify for hedge accounting treatment  the resulting asset  liability and related mark to market gains or losses are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as prepaid expenses and other current assets  other current liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive income loss  respectively  until settled 
upon settlement  realized gains or losses on these contracts will be reclassified to cost of product sold propane and other gas liquid sales in the consolidated statements of earnings as the underlying inventory is sold 
these financial derivative purchase commitment net gains are expected to be offset by reduced margins on propane sales commitments that qualify for the normal purchase normal sale exception 
at july   we estimate of currently open financial derivative purchase commitments  the related propane sales commitments  and the resulting gross margin will be realized into earnings during fiscal our business strategy is to expand our operations through disciplined acquisitions and internal growth  capitalize on our national presence and economies of scale  maximize operating efficiencies through utilization of our technology platform  and align employee interests with our investors through significant employee ownership 
net earnings loss attributable to ferrellgas partners  lp in fiscal were million as compared to million in fiscal this decrease of million was primarily due to a decrease in gross margin propane and other gas liquids sales of million  an increase in loss on extinguishment of debt of million and an increase in general and administrative expense primarily due to the incurrence of a million litigation accrual and related legal expenses 
forward looking statements statements included in this report include forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are identified as any statement that does not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
these statements often use words such as anticipate  believe  intend  plan  projection  forecast  strategy  position  continue  estimate  expect  may  will  or the negative of those terms or other variations of them or comparable terminology 
these statements often discuss plans  strategies  events or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future and are based upon the beliefs and assumptions of our management and on the information currently available to them 
in particular  statements  express or implied  concerning our future operating results or our ability to generate sales  income or cash flow are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are not guarantees of performance 
you should not put undue reliance on any forward looking statements 
all forward looking statements are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by these forward looking statements 
many of the factors that will affect our future results are beyond our ability to control or predict 
some of our forward looking statements include the following whether the operating partnership will have sufficient funds to meet its obligations  including its obligations under its debt securities  and to enable it to distribute to ferrellgas partners sufficient funds to permit ferrellgas partners to meet its obligations with respect to its existing debt  whether ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership will continue to meet all of the quarterly financial tests required by the agreements governing their indebtedness  and our expectations that net earnings will be greater in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to our expectation that loss on extinguishment of debt will not recur 

table of contents when considering any forward looking statement  you should also keep in mind the risk factors set forth in item a 
risk factors 
any of these risks could impair our business  financial condition or results of operations 
any such impairment may affect our ability to make distributions to our unitholders or pay interest on the principal of any of our debt securities 
in addition  the trading price  if any  of our securities could decline as a result of any such impairment 
except for our ongoing obligations to disclose material information as required by federal securities laws  we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements or risk factors after the date of this annual report on form k 
in addition  the classification of ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership as partnerships for federal income tax purposes means that we do not generally pay federal income taxes 
we do  however  pay taxes on the income of our subsidiaries that are corporations 
we rely on a legal opinion from our counsel  and not a ruling from the internal revenue service  as to our proper classification for federal income tax purposes 
see the section entitled  item a 
risk factors tax risks 
the irs could treat us as a corporation for tax purposes or changes in federal or state laws could subject us to entity level taxation  which would substantially reduce the cash available for distribution to our unitholders or to pay interest on the principal of any of our debt securities

although weather in the more highly concentrated geographic areas we serve was approximately colder than that of the prior year period  we believe retail sales gallons were negatively impacted by the severity and length of the overall poor economic environment and the significantly higher wholesale cost of propane which resulted in customer conservation 
in addition to the above  we believe retail sales volumes decreased due to an abnormally wet harvest season during the prior year period which increased gallon sales for agricultural crop drying that was not repeated during the current year period s abnormally dry harvest season

retail sales volumes increased primarily due to million gallons through acquisitions completed during the last twelve months and also due to gallons gained from our focus on expanding our operations through an internal growth strategy

table of contents interest expense operating partnership interest expense increased million primarily due to a million increase due to the issuance of new senior debt at higher interest rates than the debt retired and higher interest rates on borrowings on our secured credit facility  million due to increased borrowings and a million increase due to the amortization of capitalized debt costs

we prepaid our million senior notes due and the related prepayment premium of million 
liquidity and capital resources general our liquidity and capital resources enable us to fund our working capital requirements  letter of credit requirements  debt service payments  acquisition and capital expenditures and distributions to our unitholders 
our liquidity may be affected by our ability to access the capital markets or by unforeseen demands on cash  or other events beyond our control 
during fiscal  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of new senior notes due at an offering price equal to par 
we applied the net proceeds of million to redeem all of our million fixed rate senior notes due and to pay the related make whole and interest payments of million 
we used the remaining proceeds to reduce outstanding indebtedness under the secured credit facility 
we also completed a registered public offering of million common units representing limited partner interests 
we applied the net proceeds of million to redeem million of our million fixed rate senior notes due and to pay the related make whole and interest payments of million 
we used the remaining proceeds to reduce outstanding indebtedness under the secured credit facility 
additionally  we issued million of common units for which the proceeds were used to reduce outstanding indebtedness under the secured credit facility 
with these financings and the application of the proceeds  we will have addressed all of our significant outstanding public debt maturities through and increased our liquidity to finance ongoing business strategies 
furthermore  our only interest rate sensitive financing will be borrowings on our million secured credit facility which  during september  was amended to change its maturity date to five years  extending the maturity date to september and our accounts receivable securitization facility scheduled to expire in april subject to meeting the financial tests discussed below and also subject to the risk factors identified in item a 
risk factors  we believe we will continue to have sufficient access to capital markets at yields acceptable to us to support our expected growth expenditures and refinancing of debt maturities 
our disciplined approach to fund necessary capital spending and other partnership needs  combined with sufficient trade credit to operate our business efficiently and available credit under our secured credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization facility should provide us the means to meet our anticipated liquidity and capital resource requirements 
during periods of high volatility  our risk management activities may expose us to the risk of counterparty margin calls in amounts greater than we have the capacity to fund 
likewise our counterparties may not be able to fulfill their margin calls from us or may default on the settlement of positions with us 

table of contents our working capital requirements are subject to  among other things  the price of propane  delays in the collection of receivables  volatility in energy commodity prices  liquidity imposed by insurance providers  downgrades in our credit ratings  decreased trade credit  significant acquisitions  the weather  customer retention and purchasing patterns and other changes in the demand for propane 
relatively colder weather or higher propane prices during the winter heating season are factors that could significantly increase our working capital requirements 
our ability to satisfy our obligations is dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to prevailing economic  financial  business and weather conditions and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
due to the seasonality of the retail propane distribution business  a significant portion of our cash flow from operations is generated during the winter heating season 
our net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects earnings from our business activities adjusted for depreciation and amortization and changes in our working capital accounts 
historically  we generate significantly lower net cash from operating activities in our first and fourth fiscal quarters as compared to the second and third fiscal quarters due to the seasonality of our business 
a quarterly distribution of was paid on september   to all common units that were outstanding on september  this represents the sixty eighth consecutive minimum quarterly distribution paid to our common unitholders dating back to october our secured credit facility  public debt and accounts receivable securitization facility contain several financial tests and covenants restricting our ability to pay distributions  incur debt and engage in certain other business transactions 
in general  these tests are based on our debt to cash flow ratio and cash flow to interest expense ratio 
our general partner currently believes that the most restrictive of these tests are debt incurrence limitations under the terms of our secured credit and accounts receivable securitization facilities and limitations on the payment of distributions within our senior notes due the secured credit and accounts receivable securitization facilities generally limit the operating partnership s ability to incur debt if it exceeds prescribed ratios of either debt to cash flow or cash flow to interest expense 
our senior notes restrict payments if a minimum ratio of cash flow to interest expense is not met  assuming certain exceptions to this ratio limit have previously been exhausted 
this restriction places limitations on our ability to make restricted payments such as the payment of cash distributions to our unitholders 
the cash flow used to determine these financial tests generally is based upon our most recent cash flow performance giving pro forma effect for acquisitions and divestitures made during the test period 
our secured credit facility  public debt and accounts receivable securitization facility do not contain early repayment provisions related to a potential decline in our credit rating 
as of july   we met all of our required quarterly financial tests and covenants 
based upon current estimates of our cash flow  our general partner believes that we will be able to continue to meet all of our required quarterly financial tests and covenants in fiscal however  we may not meet the applicable financial tests in future quarters if we were to experience significantly warmer than normal winter temperatures  a continued volatile energy commodity cost environment  an unexpected downturn in business operations  a change in customer retention or purchasing patterns due to economic or other factors in the united states  or a material downturn in the credit and or equity markets 
failure to meet applicable financial tests could have a materially adverse effect on our operating capacity and cash flows and could restrict our ability to incur debt or to make cash distributions to our unitholders  even if sufficient funds were available 
depending on the circumstances  we may consider alternatives to permit the incurrence of debt or the continued payment of the quarterly cash distribution to our unitholders 
no assurances can be given  however  that such alternatives can or will be implemented with respect to any given quarter 
we expect our future capital expenditures and working capital needs to be provided by a combination

off balance sheet financing arrangements in this section we discuss our off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to 
table of contents have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
an off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has made guarantees  an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity  or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company  or that engages in leasing  hedging or research and development arrangements with the company 
our off balance sheet arrangements include the leasing of transportation equipment  property and computer equipment and letters of credit available under our secured credit facility 
the leasing of transportation equipment  property and computer equipment is accounted for as operating leases 
we believe these arrangements are a cost effective method for financing our equipment needs 
these off balance sheet arrangements enable us to lease equipment from third parties rather than  among other options  purchasing the equipment using on balance sheet financing 
most of the operating leases involving our transportation equipment contain residual value guarantees 
these transportation equipment lease arrangements are scheduled to expire over the next seven years 
most of these arrangements provide that the fair value of the equipment will equal or exceed a guaranteed amount  or we will be required to pay the lessor the difference 
although the fair values at the end of the lease terms have historically exceeded these guaranteed amounts  the maximum potential amount of aggregate future payments we could be required to make under these leasing arrangements  assuming the equipment is worthless at the end of the lease term  was million as of july  we do not know of any event  demand  commitment  trend or uncertainty that would result in a material change to these arrangements

our financial position and results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from the actual amounts  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements due to the estimation process and business judgment involved in their application depreciation of property  plant and equipment we calculate depreciation on property  plant and equipment using the straight line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from two to years 
changes in the estimated useful lives of our property  plant and equipment could have a material effect on our results of operations 
the estimates of the assets useful lives require our judgment regarding assumptions about the useful life of the assets being depreciated 
when necessary  the depreciable lives are revised and the impact on depreciation is treated on a prospective basis 
there were no such revisions to depreciable lives in fiscal  or residual value of customer and storage tanks we use an estimated residual value when calculating depreciation for our customer and bulk storage tanks 
customer and bulk storage tanks are classified as property  plant and equipment on our consolidated balance sheets 
the depreciable basis of these tanks is calculated using the original cost less the residual value 
depreciation is calculated using straight line method based on the tanks estimated useful life of years 
changes in the estimated residual value could have a material effect on our results of operations 
the estimates of the tanks residual value require our judgment of the value of the tanks at the end of their useful life or retirement 
when necessary  the tanks residual values are revised and the impact on depreciation is treated on a prospective basis 
there were no such revisions to residual values in fiscal  or valuation methods  amortization methods and estimated useful lives of intangible assets the specific  identifiable intangible assets of a business enterprise depend largely upon the nature of its operations 
potential intangible assets include intellectual property such as trademarks and trade names  customer lists and relationships  and non compete agreements  as well as other intangible assets 
the approach to the valuation of each intangible asset will vary depending upon the nature of the asset  the business in which it is utilized  and the economic returns it is generating or is expected to generate 
during fiscal  and  we did not find it necessary to adjust the valuation methods used for any acquired intangible assets 
our recorded intangible assets primarily include the estimated value assigned to certain customer related and contract based assets representing the rights we own arising from the acquisition of propane distribution companies and related contractual agreements 
a customer related or contract based intangible with a finite useful life is amortized over its estimated useful life  which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the entity 
we believe that trademarks and trade names have an indefinite useful life due to our intention to utilize all acquired trademarks and trade names 
when necessary  the intangible assets useful lives are revised and the impact on amortization will be reflected on a prospective basis 
the determination of the fair market value of the intangible asset and the estimated useful life are based on an analysis of all pertinent factors including the use of widely accepted valuation approaches  the income approach or the cost approach  the expected use of the asset by the entity  the expected useful life of related assets  any legal  regulatory or contractual provisions  including renewal or extension periods that would not cause substantial costs or modifications to existing agreements  the effects of obsolescence  demand  
table of contents competition  and other economic factors and the level of maintenance required to obtain the expected future cash flows 
if the underlying assumption s governing the amortization of an intangible asset were later determined to have significantly changed either favorably or unfavorably  then we may be required to adjust the amortization period of such asset to reflect any new estimate of its useful life 
such a change would increase or decrease the annual amortization charge associated with the asset at that time 
during fiscal  and  we did not find it necessary to adjust the valuation method  estimated useful life or amortization period of any of our intangible assets 
should any of the underlying assumptions indicate that the value of the intangible asset might be impaired  we may be required to reduce the carrying value and subsequent useful life of the asset 
any such write down of the value and unfavorable change in the useful life ie  amortization period of an intangible asset would increase operating costs and expenses at that time 
as of july   and  the carrying value of our intangible asset portfolio was million  million and million  respectively 
we did not recognize any impairment losses related to our intangible assets during fiscal  or for additional information regarding our intangible assets  see note b summary of significant accounting policies and note g goodwill and intangible assets  net to our consolidated financial statements 
fair value of derivative commodity contracts we enter into commodity forward  futures  swaps and options contracts involving propane and related products to hedge exposures to price risk 
these contracts are accounted for using the fair value method 
under this valuation method  derivatives are carried in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with changes in value recognized in cost of product sold in the consolidated statements of earnings or in other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of partners capital 
we utilize published settlement prices for exchange traded contracts  quotes provided by brokers and estimates of market prices based on daily contract activity to estimate the fair value of these contracts 
changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these contracts could have a material effect on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of earnings 
for further discussion of derivative commodity contracts  see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  note b summary of significant accounting policies and note j derivatives to our consolidated financial statements 
we do not anticipate future changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these derivative contracts 
stock and unit based compensation we utilize a binomial valuation tool to compute an estimated fair value of stock and unit based awards at each balance sheet date 
this valuation tool requires a number of inputs  some of which require an estimate to be made by management 
significant estimates include our computation of volatility  the number of groups of employees  the expected term of awards and the forfeiture rate of awards 
our stock based awards plan grants awards out of ferrell companies 
ferrell companies is not a publicly traded company and management does not believe it can be categorized within any certain industry group 
as a result  our volatility computation is highly subjective 
if a different volatility factor were used  it could significantly change the fair value assigned to stock based awards at each balance sheet date 
management believes we have three groups of employees that participate in our stock and unit based compensation plans 
if a determination were made that we have a different number of groups of employees  that determination could significantly change the expected term and forfeiture rate assigned to our stock and unit based awards 
our method for computing the expected term of our stock and unit based awards utilizes a 
table of contents combination of historical exercise patterns and estimates made by management on grantee exercises patterns 
this method could assign a term to our stock and unit based awards that is significantly different from their actual terms  which could result in a significant difference in the fair value assigned to the awards at each balance sheet date 
our method for computing the expected forfeiture rates of our stock and unit based awards utilizes a combination of historical forfeiture patterns and estimates made by management on forfeiture patterns 
if actual forfeiture rates were to differ significantly from our estimates  it could result in significant differences between actual and reported compensation expense for our stock and unit based awards 
litigation accruals and environmental liabilities we are involved in litigation regarding pending claims and legal actions that arise in the normal course of business and may own sites at which hazardous substances may be present 
in accordance with gaap  we establish reserves for pending claims and legal actions or environmental remediation liabilities when it is probable that a liability exists and the amount or range of amounts can be reasonably estimated 
reasonable estimates involve management judgments based on a broad range of information and prior experience 
these judgments are reviewed quarterly as more information is received and the amounts reserved are updated as necessary 
such estimated reserves may differ materially from the actual liability and such reserves may change materially as more information becomes available and estimated reserves are adjusted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we did not enter into any risk management trading activities during fiscal our remaining market risk sensitive instruments and positions have been determined to be other than trading 
commodity price risk management our risk management activities primarily attempt to mitigate price risks related to the purchase  storage  transport and sale of propane generally in the contract and spot markets from major domestic energy companies on a short term basis 
we attempt to mitigate these price risks through the use of financial derivative instruments and forward propane purchase and sales contracts 
our risk management strategy involves taking positions in the forward or financial markets that are equal and opposite to our positions in the physical products market in order to minimize the risk of financial loss from an adverse price change 
this risk management strategy is successful when our gains or losses in the physical product markets are offset by our losses or gains in the forward or financial markets 
these financial derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges 
our risk management activities include the use of financial derivative instruments including  but not limited to  price swaps  options  futures and basis swaps to seek protection from adverse price movements and to minimize potential losses 
we enter into these financial derivative instruments directly with third parties in the over the counter market and with brokers who are clearing members with the new york mercantile exchange 
we also enter into forward propane purchase and sales contracts with counterparties 
these forward contracts qualify for the normal purchase normal sales exception within gaap guidance and are therefore not recorded on our financial statements until settled 
market risks associated with energy commodities are monitored daily by senior management for compliance with our commodity risk management policy 
this policy includes an aggregate dollar loss limit and limits on the term of various contracts 
we also utilize volume limits for various energy commodities and review our positions daily where we remain exposed to market risk  so as to manage exposures to changing market prices 

table of contents we have prepared a sensitivity analysis to estimate the exposure to market risk of our energy commodity positions 
forward contracts  futures  swaps and options outstanding as of july  and  that were used in our risk management activities were analyzed assuming a hypothetical adverse change in prices for the delivery month for all energy commodities 
the potential loss in future earnings from these positions due to a adverse movement in market prices of the underlying energy commodities was estimated at million and million as of july  and  respectively 
the preceding hypothetical analysis is limited because changes in prices may or may not equal  thus actual results may differ 
our sensitivity analysis includes designated hedging and the anticipated transactions associated with these hedging transactions 
these hedging transactions are anticipated to be effective  therefore  there is no effect on our sensitivity analysis from these hedging transactions 
to the extent option contracts are used as hedging instruments for anticipated transactions we have included the offsetting effect of the anticipated transactions  only to the extent the option contracts are in the money  or would become in the money as a result of the hypothetical movement in prices 
all other anticipated transactions for risk management activities have been excluded from our sensitivity analysis 
credit risk we maintain credit policies with regard to our counterparties for propane procurement that we believe significantly minimize overall credit risk 
these policies include an evaluation of counterparties financial condition including credit ratings  and entering into agreements with counterparties that govern credit guidelines 
these counterparties consist of major energy companies who are suppliers  wholesalers  retailers  end users and financial institutions 
the overall impact due to certain changes in economic  regulatory and other events may impact our overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively in that counterparties may be similarly impacted 
based on our policies  exposures  credit and other reserves  management does not anticipate a material adverse effect on financial position or results of operations as a result of counterparty performance 
interest rate risk at july  and  we had million and million  respectively  in variable rate secured credit facility and collateralized note payable borrowings 
thus  assuming a one percent increase in our variable interest rate  our interest rate risk related to these borrowings would result in a loss in future earnings of million for fiscal the preceding hypothetical analysis is limited because changes in interest rates may or may not equal one percent  thus actual results may differ
