item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition executive summary of consolidated results of operations in this discussion and analysis  the company analyzes contributions to consolidated earnings and earnings per share from its utility group and nonutility group separately since each operates independently requiring distinct competencies and business strategies  offers different energy and energy related products and services  and experiences different opportunities and risks 
nonutility group operations are discussed below as primary operations and other operations 
primary nonutility operations denote areas of management s forward looking focus 
the utility group generates revenue primarily from the delivery of natural gas and electric service to its customers 
the primary source of cash flow for the utility group results from the collection of customer bills and the payment for goods and services procured for the delivery of gas and electric services 
the activities of and revenues and cash flows generated by the nonutility group are closely linked to the utility industry  and the results of those operations are generally impacted by factors similar to those impacting the overall utility industry 
in addition  there are other operations  referred to herein as corporate and other  that include unallocated corporate expenses such as advertising and charitable contributions  among other activities 
the company has in place a disclosure committee that consists of senior management as well as financial management 
the committee is actively involved in the preparation and review of the company s sec filings 
net income and earnings per share  in total and by group  for the years ended december    and follow year ended december  in millions  except per share data net income attributed to utility group nonutility group corporate other basic earnings per share attributed to utility group nonutility group corporate other results for the year ended december   consolidated net income was million  or per share  compared to earnings of million  or per share in and million  or per share in utility group in  the utility group s earnings were million  compared to earnings of million in and million in the increase in compared to results from the return of large customer usage  summer cooling weather that was significantly warmer than normal and the prior year  and lower operating expenses 
utility group results were down only modestly in compared to  even after considering the impacts of the recession on large customer usage and wholesale power sales and mild cooling weather 
the years presented have also been impacted by increased depreciation expense and interest expense associated with rate base growth  increased revenues associated with regulatory initiatives  volatile market values associated with investments related to benefit plans  and ch anges in the effective tax rate 
margin in the company s electric and the ohio natural gas service territory  which was not fully protected by straight fixed variable rate design in and  is impacted by weather 
during  cooling weather was percent warmer than normal and percent warmer than the prior year 
due primarily to the extreme cooling weather  management estimates the margin impact of weather to be approximately million favorable  or per share  compared to normal temperatures 
compared to which was impacted by mild cooling weather  the margin impact is estimated to be million  or per share 
in weather impacts were per share unfavorable compared to normal temperatures 
management estimates the impact of weather based on an assumption of weather s ensitive sales per degree day at current rates 

table of contents nonutility group in  nonutility group earnings were million  compared to earnings of million in and million in the period was impacted by charges related to legacy investments totaling million after tax 
the period contains the million after tax liberty charge see note to the consolidated financial statements  and the period contains a million after tax charge associated with legacy commercial real estate investments 
all other nonutility operating results decreased by approximately million in compared to driven primarily by reduced optimization opportunities at proliance  which resulted in it operating a loss in the other operating businesses of miller pipeline  energy systems group  vectren fuels  and vectren source combined for million of earnings contribution in all other results in compared to increased by million due primarily to increased earnings from coal mining operations 
results from coal mining operations improved due to increased pricing effective january dividends dividends declared for the year ended december  were per share  compared to in and per share in in november  the company s board of directors increased its quarterly dividend to per share from per share 
the increase marks the st consecutive year vectren and predecessor companies have increased annual dividends paid 
impacts of share issuance in the increased number of common shares outstanding  resulting from the issuance of common shares in  contributed a reduction in earnings per share in compared to use of non gaap performance measures and per share measures per share earnings contributions of the utility group  nonutility group  and corporate and other are presented and are non gaap measures 
such per share amounts are based on the earnings contribution of each group included in vectren s consolidated results divided by vectren s basic average shares outstanding during the period 
the earnings per share of the groups do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities allocated to the groups  but rather represent a direct equity interest in vectren corporation assets and liabilities as a whole 
these non gaap measures are used by management to evaluate the performance of individual businesses 
in addition  other items giving rise to period over period variances  such as weather  are presented on an after tax and per share bas is 
these amounts are calculated at a statutory tax rate divided by vectren s basic average shares outstanding during the period 
accordingly  management believes these measures are useful to investors in understanding each business contribution to consolidated earnings per share and in analyzing consolidated period to period changes and the potential for earnings per share contributions in future periods 
reconciliations of the non gaap measures to their most closely related gaap measure of consolidated earnings per share are included throughout this discussion and analysis 
the non gaap financial measures disclosed by the company should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap  and the financial results calculated in accordance with gaap 
detailed discussion of results of operations following is a more detailed discussion of the results of operations of the company s utility and nonutility operations 
the detailed results of operations for these groups are presented and analyzed before the reclassification and elimination of certain intersegment transactions necessary to consolidate those results into the company s consolidated statements of income 

table of contents results of operations of the utility group the utility group is comprised of utility holdings operations and consists of the company s regulated operations and other operations that provide information technology and other support services to those regulated operations 
regulated operations consist of a natural gas distribution business that provides natural gas distribution and transportation services to nearly two thirds of indiana and to west central ohio and an electric transmission and distribution business  which provides electric distribution services primarily to southwestern indiana  and the company s power generating and wholesale power operations 
in total  these regulated operations supply natural gas and or electricity to over one million customers 
utility group ope rating results before certain intersegment eliminations and reclassifications for the years ended december    and  follow year ended december  in millions  except per share data operating revenues gas utility electric utility other total operating revenues operating expenses cost of gas sold cost of fuel purchased power other operating depreciation amortization taxes other than income taxes total operating expenses operating income other income net interest expense income before income taxes income taxes net income contribution to vectren basic eps trends in utility operations the regulatory environment gas and electric operations  with regard to retail rates and charges  terms of service  accounting matters  financing  and certain other operational matters specific to its indiana customers the operations of sigeco and indiana gas  are regulated by the iurc 
the retail gas operations of the ohio operations vedo are subject to regulation by the puco 
over the last four years  the company has obtained base rate orders at each of its four utilities with sigeco s gas and electric territories obtaining base rate increases in august of  indiana gas in february  and vedo in january the orders authorize a return on equity ranging from to 
the authorized returns reflect the impact of innovative rate design strategies having been authorized by these state commissions 
outside of a full base rate proceeding  these innovative approaches to some extent mitigate the impacts of investments in government mandated projects  operating costs that are volatile or that increase with government mandates  and changing consumption patterns 
in addition to timely gas and fuel cost recovery  just over million of the utility gr oup s approximate million in other operating expenses incurred during are subject to a recovery mechanism outside of base rates 

table of contents rate design strategies sales of natural gas and electricity to residential and commercial customers are seasonal and are impacted by weather 
trends in average use among natural gas residential and commercial customers have tended to decline as more efficient appliances and furnaces are installed  the company s utilities have implemented conservation programs  and the price of natural gas has been volatile 
in the company s two indiana natural gas service territories  normal temperature adjustment nta and lost margin recovery mechanisms largely mitigate the effect that would otherwise be caused by variations in volumes sold to these customers due to weather and changing consumption patterns 
the ohio natural gas service territory has a straight fixed variable rate design 
this rate design  which was fully implemented i n february  mitigates most of the ohio service territory s weather risk and risk of decreasing consumption 
prior to the implementation of this rate design  the ohio service territory had a lost margin recovery mechanism 
in all natural gas service territories  commissions have authorized bare steel and cast iron replacement programs 
sigeco s electric service territory currently recovers certain environmental investments and other transmission investments outside of base rates 
the electric service territory has neither an nta nor a decoupling mechanism  however  rate designs proposed in the current rate proceeding before the iurc and other related filings would limit weather risk and provide for a decoupling and or a lost margin recovery mechanism that works in tandem with conservation initiatives 
tracked operating expenses gas costs and fuel costs incurred to serve indiana customers are two of the company s most significant operating expenses 
rates charged to natural gas customers in indiana contain a gas cost adjustment gca clause 
the gca clause allows the company to timely charge for changes in the cost of purchased gas  inclusive of unaccounted for gas expense based on historical experience 
electric rates contain a fuel adjustment clause fac that allows for timely adjustment in charges for electric energy to reflect changes in the cost of fuel 
the net energy cost of purchased power  subject to an approved variable benchmark based on nymex natural gas prices  is also timely recovered through the fac 
gca and fac procedures involve periodic filings and iurc hearings to establish the amount of price adjustments for a designated future period 
the procedures also provide for inclusion in later periods of any variances between actual recoveries representing the estimated costs and actual costs incurred 
the iurc has also applied the statute authorizing gca and fac procedures to reduce rates when necessary to limit net operating income to a level authorized in its last general rate order through the application of an earnings test 
these earnings tests have not had any material impact to the company s recent operating results and are not expected to have any material impact in the foreseeable future 
prior to october   gas costs were recovered in ohio through a gas cost recovery gcr mechanism 
the gcr operated similar to the gca clause in indiana  however  the gcr was subject to a periodic audit rather than a quarterly hearing process 
the puco has completed all audits of periods prior to october  and no issues or findings are outstanding 
after october   the company is no longer the supplier of natural gas to customers  and therefore no longer recovers natural gas costs via the gcr 
in indiana  gas pipeline integrity management costs  costs to fund energy efficiency programs  miso costs  and the gas cost component of uncollectible accounts expense based on historical experience are recovered by mechanisms outside of standard base rate recovery 
certain operating costs  including depreciation  associated with operating environmental compliance equipment at electric generation facilities and regional electric transmission investments are also recovered outside of base rates 
in ohio expenses such as uncollectible accounts expense  costs associated with exiting the merchant function  and costs associated with a distribution replacement program are subject to recovery outside of base rates 
revenues and margins are also impacted by the collection of state mandated taxes  which primarily f luctuate with gas and fuel costs 
see the rate and regulatory matters section of this discussion and analysis for more specific information on significant proceedings involving the company s utilities over the last three years 

table of contents utility group margin throughout this discussion  the terms gas utility margin and electric utility margin are used 
gas utility margin is calculated as gas utility revenues less the cost of gas sold 
electric utility margin is calculated as electric utility revenues less cost of fuel purchased power 
the company believes gas utility and electric utility margins are better indicators of relative contribution than revenues since gas prices and fuel and purchased power costs can be volatile and are generally collected on a dollar for dollar basis from customers 
following is a discussion a nd analysis of margin generated from regulated utility operations 
gas utility margin gas utility revenues less cost of gas sold gas utility margin and throughput by customer type follows year ended december  in millions gas utility revenues cost of gas sold total gas utility margin margin attributed to residential commercial customers industrial customers other sold transported volumes in mmdth attributed to residential commercial customers industrial customers total sold transported volumes over the three years ended december   there has been a decline in the volumes sold to residential and commercial customers driven by weather and changing consumption patterns 
however  the impact on margin has been generally offset as planned by rate design strategies and the implementation of new base rates in two of the three gas service territories 
large customer volumes were impacted by the recession  falling approximately percent in compared to with the economy stabilizing in  volumes in returned to levels 
the shifting volumes were the principal reason for the change in large customer margin in those years 
the average cost per dekatherm of gas purchased during was  compared to in and in for the year ended december   gas utility margins were million and compared to increased million 
management estimates an increase of million due to ohio rate design changes  as described below 
large customer margin  net of the impacts of regulatory initiatives and tracked costs  increased by million due primarily to increased volumes sold 
margin decreased million due to lower miscellaneous revenues and other revenues associated with lower gas costs 
the remaining decrease is primarily due to a million decrease for lower operating expenses and revenue taxes directly recovered in margin 
for the year ended december   gas utility margins decreased million compared to management estimates a million year over year decrease in industrial customer margin associated with lower volumes sold  and slightly lower residential and commercial customer counts decreased margin approximately million 
these recessionary impacts were offset by margin associated with regulatory initiatives 
among all customer classes  margin increases associated with regulatory initiatives  including the full impact of the vectren north base rate increase effective in february and the vectren ohio base rate increase effective february  were million year over year 
the impact of operating costs  including revenue and usage taxes  recovered in margin was unfavorable m illion year over year  reflecting lower revenue taxes offset by higher pass through operating expenses 
the remaining decrease primarily relates to ohio weather and lower miscellaneous revenues associated with reconnection fees 
the lower fees as well as the lower revenue and usage taxes correlate with lower year over year gas costs 

table of contents the rate design approved by the puco on january   and initially implemented on february   allowed for the phased movement toward a straight fixed variable rate design  which places substantially all of the fixed cost recovery in the monthly customer service charge 
this rate design mitigates most weather risk as well as the effects of declining usage  similar to the company s lost margin recovery mechanism in place in the indiana natural gas service territories and the mechanism in place in ohio prior to this rate order 
since the straight fixed variable rate design was fully implemented in february  nearly percent of the combined residential and commercial base rate gas margins were recovered through the customer service charge 
as a result  some margin previously recovered du ring the peak delivery winter months was more ratably recognized throughout the year 
in addition in  the company began recognizing a return on and of investments made to replace distribution risers and bare steel and cast iron infrastructure per a puco order 
electric utility margin electric utility revenues less cost of fuel purchased power electric utility margin and volumes sold by customer type follows year ended december  in millions electric utility revenues cost of fuel purchased power total electric utility margin margin attributed to residential commercial customers industrial customers municipals other customers subtotal retail wholesale margin total electric utility margin electric volumes sold in gwh attributed to residential commercial customers industrial customers municipals other total retail firm wholesale volumes sold retail electric retail utility margins were million for the year ended december   and compared to increased million 
management estimates the impact of warmer than normal weather to have increased residential and commercial margin million year over year 
management also estimates industrial margins  net of the impacts of regulatory initiatives and recovery of tracked costs  to have increased approximately million year to date due primarily to increased volumes 
margin among the customer classes associated with returns on pollution control investments increased million  and margin associated with tracked costs such as recovery of miso and pollution control operating expenses increased million 
electric retail utility margin was million for the year ended december   and compared to increased million 
increased margin among the customer classes associated with returns on pollution control equipment and other investments totaled million year over year  and margin associated with tracked costs such as recovery of miso and pollution control operating expenses increased million 
management estimates weather  driven primarily by cooling weather percent milder than the prior year  decreased residential and commercial margin million compared to industrial margins  net of the impacts of regulatory initiatives and recovery of tracked costs  decreased approximately million due primarily to the weak economy 
the industrial decreases were due p rimarily to lower usage 

table of contents margin from wholesale electric activities periodically  generation capacity is in excess of native load 
the company markets and sells this unutilized generating and transmission capacity to optimize the return on its owned assets 
substantially all off system sales occur into the miso day ahead and real time markets 
further detail of wholesale activity follows year ended december  in millions transmission system margin off system margin total wholesale margin beginning in june  the company began earning a return on electric transmission projects constructed by the company in its service territory that meet the criteria of miso s regional transmission expansion plans 
margin associated with these projects  including the reconciliation of recovery mechanisms  and other transmission system operations  totaled million during  compared to in and million in the increase in these transmission system sales is principally due to the increased investment in qualifying projects 
for the year ended december   margin from off system sales was million  compared to million in and million in in compared to  margin from off system sales decreased million 
the company experienced lower wholesale power marketing margins due primarily to lower demand and wholesale prices due to the recession  coupled with increased coal costs 
off system sales totaled gwh in  compared to gwh in  and  gwh in the base rate increase effective august   requires that wholesale margin from off system sales earned above or below million be shared equally with customers as measured on a fiscal year ending in august 
results for the periods presented reflect the impact of that sharing 
purchased power the company s mix of generated and purchased electricity has been more volatile in recent years due to changing commodity prices and the presence of wind farm purchased power agreements 
for the years ended december    and  respectively  the company purchased approximately  gwh   gwh  and gwh  of power from the miso and other sources 
the total cost associated with these volumes of purchased power is approximately million  million  and million in   and  respectively  and is included in the cost of fuel purchased power 
utility group operating expenses other operating for the year ended december   other operating expenses were million  which is a decrease in expenses compared to excluding expenses tracked directly in margin  operating costs decreased million 
the primary drivers of the decrease are a million reduction in indiana uncollectible accounts expense and the million in costs for environmental matters related to manufactured gas plant site clean up incurred in for the year ended december   other operating expenses were million  increasing million compared to approximately million of the change results from increased costs directly recovered through utility margin 
increases in other operating expenses in  not directly recovered in margin  include an approximate million increase for certain compensation costs and a million increase associated with environmental matters related to manufactured gas plant site clean up 
all other operating expenses were approximately million lower than the prior year driven primarily by reductions in electric maintenance costs and lower chemical costs 
despite significantly lower gas costs due to the recession  in diana uncollectible accounts expense was only slightly favorable compared to depreciation amortization for the year ended december   depreciation expense was million  compared to in and in the increase over the periods presented is due largely to utility capital expenditures placed into service 
plant placed into service in included the approximate million so scrubber 

table of contents taxes other than income taxes taxes other than income taxes decreased million in compared to and decreased million in compared to these taxes are primarily revenue related taxes 
the variations are primarily attributable to volatility in revenues  inclusive of changes in natural gas prices and gas volumes sold 
these tax expenses are recovered through revenue 
other income net other income net reflects income of million in  compared to income of million in and million in the higher earnings in reflect the partial recovery from the market declines associated with investments related to benefit plans 
interest expense for the year ended december   interest expense was million  compared to million in and million in the million increase in compared to reflects the impact of long term financing transactions completed in  offset by lower interest from less debt outstanding overall 
the slight decrease in interest expense in compared to reflects lower short term interest rates and lower average short term debt balances 
the lower short term balances were reflective of lower gas prices and the issuance of new long term debt 
the long term financing transactions completed in include a second quarter issuance by utility holdings of million in unsecured eleven year notes with an interest rate of percent and a third quarter completion by sigeco of a million debt issuance of year tax exempt first mortgage bonds with an interest rate of percent 
income taxes federal and state income taxes were million in  compared to million in and million in the annual change is primarily impacted by greater pre tax income in and no manufacturing tax deduction in as a result of significant bonus depreciation driving down qualifying income 
in addition  the lower effective tax rate in reflects a greater share of taxable income in states with low  or no  state income taxes 
during the first quarter of  the company recorded a million increase to its deferred tax liabilities associated with a change in the federal tax treatment of the medicare part d subsidy as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of signed by the president as of the end of march like tax law changes in the past  it is expected that the impact of this change will be reflected in customer rates in the future 
as a result  the company has recorded a million regulatory asset related to this matter in its financial statements at december  environmental matters clean air act the clean air interstate rule cair is an allowance cap and trade program that required reductions from coal burning power plants for nox emissions beginning january  and so emissions beginning january   with a second phase of reductions in on july   the us court of appeals for the district of columbia vacated the federal cair regulations 
various parties filed motions for reconsideration  and on december   the court reinstated the cair regulations and remanded the regulations back to the epa for promulgation of revisions in accordance with the court s july  order 
thus  the original version of cair promulgated in march of remains effective while epa revises it per the court s guidance 
sigeco is in compliance with the current cair phase i annual nox reduction requirements in effect on january   and the phase i annual so reduction requirements in effect on january  utilization of the company s inventory of nox and so allowances may also be impacted if cair is further revised 
most of these allowances were granted to the company at zero cost  therefore  any reduction in carrying value that could result from future changes in regulations would be immaterial 
similarly  in march of  epa promulgated the clean air mercury rule camr 
camr is an allowance cap and trade program requiring further reductions in mercury emissions from coal burning power plants 
the camr regulations were vacated by the us court of appeals for the dc circuit in july in response to the court decision  epa has announced that it intends to publish proposed maximum achievable control technology standards for mercury in it is uncertain what emission limit the epa is considering  and whether they will address hazardous pollutants in addition to mercury 

table of contents to comply with indiana s implementation plan of the clean air act of  the cair regulations  and to comply with potential future regulations of mercury and further nox and so reductions  sigeco has iurc authority to invest in clean coal technology 
using this authorization  sigeco has invested approximately million in pollution control equipment  including selective catalytic reduction scr systems  fabric filters  and an so scrubber at its generating facility that is jointly owned with alcoa the company  s portion is mw 
scr technology is the most effective method of reducing nox emissions where high removal efficiencies are required and fabric filters control particulate matter emissions 
of the million  million was included in rate base for purposes of determining sigeco s new electric base rates that went into effect on august   and million is currently recovered through a rider mechanism which is periodically updated for actual costs incurred including depreciation expense 
as part of its recent rate proceeding  the company has requested to also include these more recent expenditures in rate base as well 
sigeco s coal fired generating fleet is percent scrubbed for so and percent controlled for nox 
sigeco investments in scrubber  scr  and fabric filter technology allows for compliance with existing regulations and should position it to comply with future reasonable mercury pollution control legislation  if and when  reductions are promulgated by epa 
on july   the epa issued its proposed revisions to cair  renamed the clean air transport rule  for public comment 
the transport rule proposes a percent reduction of so over national levels and a percent reduction of nox over national levels and would further impact the utili zation of currently granted so and nox allowances 
the company is currently reviewing the sufficiency of its existing pollution control equipment in relation to the requirements proposed in the clean air transport rule and currently does not expect significant capital expenditures will be required to comply if the transport rule is adopted in its current form 
climate change vectren is committed to responsible environmental stewardship and conservation efforts 
while scientific uncertainties exist and the debate surrounding global climate change is ongoing  current information suggests a potential for adverse economic and social consequences should world wide carbon dioxide co and other greenhouse gas emissions continue at present levels 
the company emits greenhouse gases ghg primarily from its fossil fuel electric generation plants 
the company uses methodology described in the acid rain program under title iv of the clean air act to calculate its level of direct co emissions from its fossil fuel electric generating plants 
the company s direct co emissions from its plants over the past years are represented below in thousands direct co emissions tons the decline in emissions from to is primarily due to recessionary impacts that resulted in a percent decrease in generation 
it is not clear to what extent this recent reduction may continue 
based on data made available through the emissions and generation resource integrated database egrid maintained by the epa  the company s direct co emissions from its fossil fuel electric generation that report under the acid rain program were less than one half of one percent of all emissions in the united states from similar sources 
the epa has yet to release data subsequent to emissions from other company operations  including those from its natural gas distribution operations  are monitored internally using the department of energy b standard  and the company will report these other emissions generated in to the epa per mandatory reporting requirements later in the need to reduce co and other greenhouse gas emissions  yet provide affordable energy  requires thoughtful balance 
for these reasons  vectren supports a national climate change policy with the following elements an inclusive scope that involves all sectors of the economy and sources of greenhouse gases  and recognizes early actions and investments made to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions  provisions for enhanced use of renewable energy sources as a supplement to base load coal generation including effective energy conservation  demand side management  and generation efficiency measures  a flexible market based cap and trade approach with zero cost allowance allocations to coal fired electric generators 
the approach should have a properly designed economic safety valve in order to reduce or eliminate extreme price spikes and potential price volatility 
a long lead time must be included to align nearer term technology capabilities and expanded generation efficiency and other enhanced renewable strategies  ensuring that generation sources will rely less on natural gas to meet short term carbon reduction requirements 
this new regime should allow for adequate resource and generation planning and remove existing impediments to efficiency enhancements posed by the current new source review provisions of the clean air act  
table of contents inclusion of incentives for investment in advanced clean coal technology and support for research and development  a strategy supporting alternative energy technologies and biofuels and increasing the domestic supply of natural gas to reduce dependence on foreign oil and imported natural gas  and the allocation of zero cost allowances to natural gas distribution companies if those companies are required to hold allowances for the benefit of the end use customer 
current initiatives to increase conservation reduce emissions the company is committed to a policy that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and conserves energy usage 
evidence of this commitment includes focusing the company s mission statement and purpose on corporate sustainability and the need to help customers conserve and manage energy costs  building a renewable energy portfolio to complement base load coal fired generation in advance of mandated renewable energy portfolio standards  implementing conservation initiatives in the company s indiana and ohio gas utility service territories  the recent settlement agreement between the company and the oucc regarding electric demand side management initiatives  evaluating potential carbon requirements with regard to new generation  other fuel supply sources  and future environmental compliance plans  reducing the company s carbon footprint by measures such as utilizing hybrid vehicles and optimizing generation efficiencies  and developing renewable energy and energy efficiency performance contracting projects through its wholly owned subsidiary  energy systems group 
legislative actions other climate change initiatives numerous competing legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years that involve carbon  energy efficiency  and renewable energy 
comprehensive energy legislation at the federal level continues to be debated  but there has been little progress to date 
the progression of regional initiatives throughout the united states has also slowed 
while no climate change legislation is pending in indiana  the state is an observer to the midwestern regional greenhouse gas reduction accord and the state s legislature debated  but did not pass  a renewable energy portfolio standard in in advance of a federal or state renewable portfolio standard  sigeco received regulatory approval to purchase a mw landfill gas generation facility from a related entity 
the facility was purchased in and is directly interconnected to the company s distribution system 
in  the company also executed a long term purchase power commitment for mw of wind energy 
these transactions supplement a mw wind energy purchase power agreement executed in in april of  the us supreme court determined that greenhouse gases meet the definition of air pollutant under the clean air act and ordered the epa to determine whether greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare 
in april of  the epa published its proposed endangerment finding for public comment 
the proposed endangerment finding concludes that carbon emissions from mobile sources pose an endangerment to public health and the environment 
the endangerment finding was finalized in december of  and is the first step toward epa regulating carbon emissions through the existing clean air act in the absence of specific carbon legislation from congress 
therefore  any new regulations wou ld likely also impact major stationary sources of greenhouse gases 
the epa has promulgated two greenhouse gas regulations that apply to sigeco s generating facilities 
in  the epa finalized a mandatory greenhouse gas emissions registry which will require reporting of emissions beginning in for the emission year 
the epa has also recently finalized a revision to the prevention of significant deterioration psd and title v permitting rules which would require facilities that emit  tons or more of greenhouse gases a year to obtain a psd permit for new construction or a significant modification of an existing facility 

table of contents impact of legislative actions other initiatives is unknown if regulations are enacted by the epa or other agencies or if legislation requiring reductions in co and other greenhouse gases or legislation mandating a renewable energy portfolio standard is adopted  such regulation could substantially affect both the costs and operating characteristics of the company s fossil fuel generating plants  nonutility coal mining operations  and natural gas distribution businesses 
further  any legislation or regulatory actions taken by the epa or other agencies would likely impact the company s generation resource planning decisions 
at this time and in the absence of final legislation or regulatory mandates  compliance costs and other effects associated with reductions in greenhouse gas emissions or obtaining renewable energy sources remain uncertain 
the company has gathered preliminary estimates of the costs to control greenhouse gas emissions 
a preliminary investigation demonstrated costs to comply would be significant  first with regard to operating expenses and later for capital expenditures as technology becomes available to control greenhouse gas emissions 
however  these compliance cost estimates are based on highly uncertain assumptions  including allowance prices if a cap and trade approach were employed  and energy efficiency targets 
costs to purchase allowances that cap greenhouse gas emissions or expenditures made to control emissions should be considered a cost of providing electricity  and as such  the company believes recovery should be timely reflected in rates charged to customers 
customer rates may also be impacted should decisions be made to reduce the level of sales to municipal and other wholesale customers in order to meet emission target s 
ash ponds coal ash disposal regulations in june  the epa issued proposed regulations affecting the management and disposal of coal combustion products  such as ash generated by the company s coal fired power plants 
the proposed rules more stringently regulate these byproducts and would likely increase the cost of operating or expanding existing ash ponds and the development of new ash ponds 
the epa did not offer a preferred alternative  but is taking public comment on multiple alternative regulations 
the alternatives include regulating coal combustion by products as hazardous waste 
at this time  the majority of the company s ash is being beneficially reused 
the proposals offered by epa allow for the beneficial reuse of ash in certain circumstances 
the company estimates capital expenditures to comply could be as much as million  and such expenditures could exceed million if the most stringent of the alternatives is selected 
annual compliance costs could increase slightly or be impacted by as much as million 
clean water act section b of the clean water act requires that generating facilities use the best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impacts 
more specifically  section b is concerned with impingement and entrainment of aquatic species in once through cooling water intake structures 
in april of  the us supreme court affirmed that the epa could  but was not required to  consider costs and benefits in making the evaluation as to the best technology available for existing facilities 
the regulation was remanded back to the epa for further consideration 
depending upon the approaches taken by the epa when it reissues the regulation  capital investments could be in the million range if new infrastructure  such as new cooling water towers  is required 
jacobsville superfund site on july   the epa listed the jacobsville neighborhood soil contamination site in evansville  indiana  on the national priorities list under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla 
the epa has identified four sources of historic lead contamination 
these four sources shut down manufacturing operations years ago 
when drawing up the boundaries for the listing  the epa included a acre block of properties surrounding the jacobsville neighborhood  including vectren wagner operations center 
vectren property has not been named as a source of the lead contamination 
vectren own soil testing  completed during the construction of the operations center  did not indicate that the vectren property contains lead contaminated soils above industrial cleanup levels 
at this time  it is anticipated that the epa may request only additional soil testing at some future date 

table of contents environmental remediation efforts in the past  indiana gas  sigeco  and others operated facilities for the manufacture of gas 
given the availability of natural gas transported by pipelines  these facilities have not been operated for many years 
under currently applicable environmental laws and regulations  those that owned or operated these facilities may now be required to take remedial action if certain contaminants are found above the regulatory thresholds at these sites 
indiana gas identified the existence  location  and certain general characteristics of gas manufacturing and storage sites for which it may have some remedial responsibility 
indiana gas completed a remedial investigation feasibility study ri fs at one of the sites under an agreed order between indiana gas and the idem  and a record of decision was issued by the idem in january indiana gas submitted the remainder of the sites to the idem voluntary remediation program vrp and is currently conducting some level of remedial activities  including groundwater monitoring at certain sites  where deemed appropriate  and will continue remedial activities at the sites as appropriate and necessary 
indiana gas accrued the estimated costs for further investigation  remediation  groundwater monitoring  and related costs for the sites 
while the total costs that may be incurred in connection with addressing these sites cannot be determined at this time  indiana gas has recorded cumulative costs that it reasonably expects to incur totaling approximately million 
the estimated accrued costs are limited to indiana gas share of the remediation efforts 
indiana gas has arrangements in place for of the sites with other potentially responsible parties prp  which limit indiana gas costs at these sites to between percent and percent 
with respect to insurance coverage  indiana gas has received approximately million from all known insurance carriers under insu rance policies in effect when these plants were in operation 
in october  sigeco received a formal information request letter from the idem regarding five manufactured gas plants that it owned and or operated and were not enrolled in the idem s vrp 
in october  sigeco filed applications to enter four of the manufactured gas plant sites in idem vrp 
the remaining site is currently being addressed in the vrp by another indiana utility 
sigeco added those four sites into the renewal of the global voluntary remediation agreement that indiana gas has in place with idem for its manufactured gas plant sites 
that renewal was approved by the idem in february sigeco was also named in a lawsuit  involving another waste disposal site subject to potential environmental remediation efforts 
with respect to that lawsuit  sig eco settled with the plaintiff during mitigating any future claims at this site 
sigeco has filed a declaratory judgment action against its insurance carriers seeking a judgment finding its carriers liable under the policies for coverage of further investigation and any necessary remediation costs that sigeco may accrue under the vrp program and or related to the site subject to the recently settled lawsuit 
in november  the court ruled on two motions for summary judgment  finding for sigeco and against certain insurers on indemnification and defense obligations in the policies at issue 
sigeco has recorded cumulative costs that it reasonably expects to incur related to these environmental matters  including the recent settlement discussed above  totaling approximately million 
however  the total costs that may be incurred in connection with addressing all of these sites cannot be determined at this time 
with respect to insurance coverage  sigeco has recorded approximately million of expected insurance recoveries from certain of its insurance carriers under insurance policies in effect when these sites were in operation 
while negotiations are ongoing with certain carriers  settlements have been reached with some carriers and million in proceeds have been received 
the costs the company expects to incur are estimated by management using assumptions based on actual costs incurred  the timing of expected future payments  and inflation factors  among others 
while the company s utilities have recorded all costs which they presently expect to incur in connection with activities at these sites  it is possible that future events may require some level of additional remedial activities which are not presently foreseen and those costs may not be subject to prp or insurance recovery 
as of december  and  respectively  approximately million and million of accrued  but not yet spent  costs are included in other liabilities related to both the indiana gas and sigeco sites 

table of contents rate regulatory matters vectren south electric base rate filing on december   vectren south filed a request with the iurc to adjust its base electric rates 
the requested increase in base rates addresses capital investments  a modified electric rate design that facilitates a partnership between vectren south and customers to pursue energy efficiency and conservation  and new energy efficiency programs to complement those currently offered for natural gas customers 
on july   vectren south revised downward its increase requested through the filing of its rebuttal position to approximately million 
the request addresses the roughly million spent in infrastructure construction since its last base rate increase in august that was needed to continue to provide reliable service and updates to operating costs and revenues 
the rate design propose d in the filing would break the link between small residential and commercial customers consumption and the utility s margin  thereby aligning the utility s and customers interests in using less energy 
the revised request assumes an overall rate of return of percent on rate base of approximately billion and an allowed return on equity roe of percent 
the oucc and sigeco industrial group separately filed testimony in this case  proposing an increase of approximately million and million  respectively 
furthermore  the intervening parties in the case took differing views on  among other matters  the proposed rate design and the level and price of coal inventory 
hearings on all matters in the case were held in early march and late august an order is anticipated in the first half of vectren south electric fuel adjustment filings as stated above  electric retail rates contain a fuel adjustment clause fac that allows for periodic adjustment in energy charges to reflect changes in the cost of fuel and purchased power 
the fac procedures involve periodic filings and iurc hearings to approve the recovery of vectren south s fuel and purchased power costs 
during  as part of its fac testimony  the oucc requested the iurc require vectren south to renegotiate its term coal contracts because they were priced higher than prevailing spot prices 
this request was repeated by the oucc in vectren south s base rate proceeding referred to above 
vectren south purchases the majority of its coal from vectren fuels  inc a nonutility wholly owned subsidiary of the company under coal contracts entered into in vectren south states in its rate case testimony that the prices in the coal contracts were at or below the market at the time of contract execution and were subject to a bidding process that included third parties 
further  the company has already engaged in contract renegotiations to defer certain deliveries  and to eliminate some volum es in  with further price negotiation to occur in under the terms of the contracts 
the iurc has already found in a number of fac proceedings since  including in its most recent fac order dated november   that the costs incurred under these coal contracts are reasonable 
the oucc also raised concerns regarding vectren south s generating unit must run policy 
under that policy  for reliability reasons  vectren south instructs the miso that certain units must be dispatched regardless of current market conditions 
the oucc is reviewing data related to vectren south s must run policy 
the parties agreed to the creation of an fac sub docket proceeding to address the specific issues noted above 
an order establishing the sub docket was issued by the iurc on july  on november   in response to a joint motion filed by the oucc and vectren south  the iurc issued an order dismissing this sub docket as these coal contract issues will be addressed in the pending vectren south electric base rate case 
vectren south electric demand side management program filing on august   vectren south filed a petition with the iurc  seeking approval of its proposed demand side management dsm programs  recovery of the costs associated with these programs  recovery of lost margins as a result of implementing these programs for large customers  and recovery of performance incentives linked with specific measurement criteria on all programs 
the dsm programs proposed are consistent with a december  order issued by the iurc  which  among other actions  defined long term conservation objectives and goals of dsm programs for all indiana electric utilities under a consistent statewide approach 
in order to meet these objectives  the iurc order divided the dsm programs into core and core plus programs 
core programs are joint programs required to be offered by all india na electric utilities to all customers  including large industrial customers 
core plus programs are those programs not required specifically by the iurc  but defined by each utility to meet the overall energy savings targets defined by the iurc 

table of contents in its august filing  vectren south proposed a three year dsm plan that expands its current portfolio of core and core plus dsm programs in order to meet the energy savings goals established by the iurc 
vectren south requested recovery of these program costs under a current tracking mechanism 
in addition  vectren south proposed a performance incentive mechanism that is contingent upon the success of each of the dsm programs in reducing energy usage to the levels defined by the iurc 
this performance incentive would also be recovered in the same tracking mechanism 
finally  the company proposed lost margin recovery associated with the implementation of dsm programs for large customers  and cited its decoupling proposal applicable to residential and general service customers in the pending elect ric base rate case 
on january   the oucc and vectren south filed a settlement with the iurc reflecting agreement on the company s programs and lost margin recovery from large customers 
a hearing will be held on march  involving all parties to this proceeding 
vedo gas base rate order received on january   the puco issued an order approving the stipulation reached in the vedo rate case 
the order provides for a rate increase of nearly million  an overall rate of return of percent on rate base of about million  an opportunity to recover costs of a program to accelerate replacement of cast iron and bare steel pipes  as well as certain service risers  and base rate recovery of an additional million in conservation program spending 
the order also adjusted the rate design used to collect the agreed upon revenue from vedo customers 
the order allows for the phased movement toward a straight fixed variable rate design for residential customers which places all of the fixed cost recovery in the customer service charge 
a straight fixed variable design mitigates most weather risk as well as the effects of declining usage  similar to the company s decoupling mechanism  which expired when this new rate design went into effect on february  in  annual results include approximately million of revenue from the decoupling mechanism that did not continue once this base rate increase went into effect 
since the straight fixed variable rate design was fully implemented in february  nearly percent of the combined residential and commercial base rate margins were recovered through the customer service charge 
the occ appealed this rate order to the ohio supreme court  which had affirmed puco orders authorizing straight fixed variable rate design in two other cases 
on december   the ohio supreme court affirmed the puco order authorizing straight fixed variable rate design in vedo s case 
with this rate order  the company has in place for its ohio gas territory rates that allow for a straight fixed variable rate design that mitigates both weather risk and lost margin for residential customers  tracking of uncollectible accounts and percent of income payment plan pipp expenses  base rate recovery of pipeline integrity management expense  timely recovery of costs associated with the accelerated replacement of bare steel and cast iron pipes  as well as certain service risers  and expanded conservation programs now totaling up to million in annual expenditures 
vedo continues the process to exit the merchant function on august   the puco approved the results of an auction selecting qualified wholesale suppliers to provide the gas commodity to the company for resale to its customers at auction determined standard pricing 
this standard pricing was comprised of the monthly nymex settlement price plus a fixed adder 
this standard pricing  which was effective from october  through march   was the initial step in exiting the merchant function in the company s ohio service territory 
the approach eliminated the need for monthly gas cost recovery gcr filings and prospective puco gcr audits 
in october  vedo s entire natural gas inventory was transferred to the auction s winning wholesale supplie rs  resulting in proceeds to vedo of approximately million 
the second phase of the exit process began on april  during this phase  the company no longer sells natural gas directly to customers 
rather  state certified competitive retail natural gas suppliers  that were successful bidders in a similar regulatory approved auction  sell the gas commodity to specific customers for a month period at auction determined standard pricing 
the first auction was conducted on january   and the auction results were approved by the puco on january  the plan approved by the puco required that the company conduct at least two annual auctions during this phase 
as such  the company conducted another auction on january  in advance of the second month term which commences on april  the results of that auction wer e approved by the puco on january  consistent with current practice  customers will continue to receive a single bill for the commodity as well as the delivery component of natural gas service from vedo 
vectren source  the company s wholly owned nonutility retail gas marketer  was a successful bidder in both auctions 

table of contents the puco provided for an exit transition cost rider  which allows the company to recover costs associated with the transition process 
exiting the merchant function should not have a material impact on earnings or financial condition 
it  however  has and will continue to reduce gas utility revenues and have an equal and offsetting impact to cost of gas sold as vedo no longer purchases gas for resale to these customers 
vectren north gas base rate order received on february   the company received an order from the iurc which approved the settlement agreement reached in its vectren north gas rate case 
the order provided for a base rate increase of million and a return on equity roe of percent  with an overall rate of return of percent on rate base of approximately million 
the order also provided for the recovery of million of costs through separate cost recovery mechanisms rather than base rates 
further  additional expenditures for a multi year bare steel and cast iron capital replacement program will be afforded certain accounting treatment that mitigates earnings attrition from the investment between rate cases 
the accounting treatment allows for the continuation of the accrual for afudc and the deferral of depreciation expense after the projects go in service but before they are included in base rates 
to qualify for this treatment  the annual expenditures are limited to million and the treatment cannot extend beyond four years from the in service date for each specific project 
with this order  the company has in place for its north gas territory weather normalization  a conservation and decoupling mechanism  recovery of gas cost expense related to uncollectible accounts expense based on historical experience and tracking of unaccounted for gas costs through the existing gca mechanism  and tracking of pipeline integrity management expense 
miso the company is a member of the miso  a ferc approved regional transmission organization 
when the company is a net seller of its generation  such net revenues  which totaled million  million  and million for the twelve months ended december    and  respectively  are included in electric utility revenues 
when the company is a net purchaser such net purchases  which totaled million  million  and million for the twelve months ended december    and  respectively  are included in cost of fuel purchased power 
net positions are determined on an hourly basis 
the company also receives transmission revenue from the miso which is included in electric utility revenues and totaled million  million  and million for the twelve months ended december    and  respectively 
these revenues result from other miso members use of the company s transmission system as well as the recovery of the company s investment in certain new electric transmission projects meeting miso s transmission expansion plan criteria 
one such project currently under construction meeting these expansion plan criteria is an interstate kv transmission line that will connect vectren s ab brown generating station to a station in indiana owned by duke energy to the north and to a station in kentucky owned by big rivers electric corporation to the south 
during the construction of these transmission assets and while these assets are in service  sigeco will recover an approximate percent return  inclusive of the ferc approved equity rate of return of percent  on capital investments through a rider mechanism which is projected annually and reconciled the following year based on actual results 
of the total investment  which is expected to approximate million  the company has invested approximately mi llion as of december  the north leg of this expansion was placed in service in november  and the south leg of this project is expected to be operational in further  the ferc approval allows for recovery of expenditures made in the event of unforeseen difficulties that delay or permanently halt the project

inclusive of holding company costs  infrastructure s operations contributed earnings of million in  compared to million in and million in in  miller s earnings contribution increased million  compared to earnings generated in even with cold weather conditions in the first quarter of restricting construction levels  results in compared to reflect higher revenues and man hours worked 
man hours increased approximately percent in compared to both and the lower earnings in compared to primarily results from customer cutbacks in spending as a result of the recession 
in addition  startup costs associated with new contracts also negatively impacted year over year results 
lower interest rates partially offset the lower margins 
the year ended december  was a record year in terms of earnings contribution from miller 
utilities continue to replace their aging natural gas and wastewater infrastructure and needs for shale gas infrastructure are becoming more prevalent 
the current low interest rate environment  when coupled with the impacts of bonus depreciation legislation and proposed regulations to accelerate the replacement of aging gas pipeline infrastructure  positions miller for future growth and resulting earnings 
energy services energy services provides energy performance contracting and renewable energy services through energy systems group  llc esg 
inclusive of holding company costs  energy services operations contributed earnings of million in  compared to million in and million in over the last three years  performance contracting operations have continued to grow 
at december   esg s backlog was million  a new record level  compared to million at december  and million at december   reflecting substantial work for and beyond 
both and were favorably impacted by discrete renewable energy projects 
as part of esg s ongoing renewable energy project development strategy  results in include the sale of a megawatt landfill gas facility 
with iurc approval  the facility was sold to sigeco  to further the utility s strategy of building a renewable energy portfolio 
esg s earnings associated with this renewable project match the results of a similar land fill gas project completed for a t hird party customer near atlanta  georgia in 
table of contents the national focus on a comprehensive energy strategy and a continued focus on renewable energy  energy conservation  and sustainability measures by esg s customers are expected to create favorable conditions for esg s future growth 
as a recent example  on february   esg was selected to design  construct  and operate a landfill gas to recycled natural gas processing facility for dekalb county  georgia s seminole road landfill 
the recycled natural gas will be used to fuel compressed natural gas cng vehicles at the seminole road landfill  and the project will result in millions of dollars in savings in fuel costs to operate the dekalb county sanitation fleet 
coal mining coal mining owns mines that produce and sell coal to the company s utility operations and to third parties through its wholly owned subsidiary vectren fuels  inc vectren fuels 
coal mining  inclusive of holding company costs  earned approximately million in  compared to million in and a loss of million in in  coal mining revenues were million  a million increase compared to and a million increase compared to in  expected higher depreciation and other mining costs as well as higher interest costs associated with the ramp up of mining at the oaktown mine complex more than offset the increase in sales 
in compared to  coal mining earnings increased based on new contract pricing effective january  the impact of higher revenues in was somewhat offset by increased costs per ton mined and the recession 
the anticipated cost increase was reflective of efforts of the contract miner to reconfigure the mining operation at prosperity mine in order to improve future productivity and meet mine safety and health administration msha requirements 
during the second half of  these improvements began to favorably impact production and operating costs 
the recent recession resulted in a decrease in the demand for  and market price of  illinois basin coal and has resulted in lower than anticipated earnings from coal mining operations 
the lowered demand caused some build up of coal inventory at most customer locations as well as at the mines owned by vectren fuels 
as a result of contracts with minimum delivery provisions  certain customers scaled back their deliveries within specified limits 
this resulted in less and mine production as production was aligned with customer s needs 
in the current market conditions  the coal mines sold million tons in  million tons in  and million tons in during  there has been some improvement in the demand and supply imbalance for illinois basin coal that began in demand is returning as evidenced by successful negotiations with a number of new term supply contracts  as well as continued spot sales 
the anticipated coal production is approximately million tons with total sales in of million tons expected and over of those sales have been contracted and priced 
oaktown mines the first of two new underground mine investments  located near vincennes  indiana  began full operations in the second mine is currently expected to open in however  vectren fuels may continue to adjust this timing as it evaluates the impacts of market conditions 
reserves at the two mines are estimated at about million tons of recoverable coal at  btu and less than pound sulfur dioxide 
the reserves at these new mines bring total coal reserves to approximately million tons at december  once in production  the two new mines are capable of producing about million tons of coal per year 
management expects to incur approximately million to access the coal reserves 
at december   vectren fuels has invested approximately million in the new mines toward initial construction 
mine safety information the company  through its wholly owned subsidiary vectren fuels  inc  owns coal mines and related assets located in indiana 
the company has retained independent third party contract mining companies to operate its coal mines 
five star mining llc five star is the contract mining company at the prosperity underground mine and black panther mining llc black panther is the contract mining company at the oaktown underground mines 
while in operation  vigo cypress creek  llc was the contract mining company at cypress creek surface mine 
the contract mining companies are the mine operator  as that term is used in both the federal mine safety and health act of the mine act and the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of all emp loyees at the coal mines are hired  supervised  and paid by the contract mining companies 
as the mine operator  the contract mining companies make all regulatory filings required by the msha 
in most circumstances  however  the cost of fines and penalties assessed by msha are contractually passed through from the contract mining company to vectren fuels 
the process of settling such claims can take years in certain circumstances 
during the year ended december   the company paid approximately million related to assessments issued to the mine operators

energy marketing energy marketing is comprised of the company s gas marketing operations  energy management services  and retail gas supply operations 
operating entities contributing to these results include proliance and vectren source 
results  inclusive of holding company costs from energy marketing for the year ended december   were a loss of million  compared to earnings of million in and million in proliance proliance  a nonutility energy marketing affiliate of vectren and citizens  provides services to a broad range of municipalities  utilities  industrial operations  schools  and healthcare institutions located throughout the midwest and southeast united states 
proliance s customers include vectren s indiana utilities and nonutility gas supply operations and citizens utilities 
proliance s primary businesses include gas marketing  gas portfolio optimization  and other portfolio and energy management services 
consistent with its ownership percentage  vectren is allocated percent of proliance s profits and losses  however  governance and voting rights remain at percent for each member 
therefore  the company accounts for its investment in proliance using the eq uity method of accounting 
vectren received regulatory approval on april   from the iurc for proliance to continue to provide natural gas supply services to the company s indiana utilities through march on november   a settlement agreement was filed with the iurc providing for proliance s continued provision of gas supply services to the company s indiana utilities and citizens gas for the period of april  through march  the settlement has been agreed to by all of the representatives that were parties to the prior settlement 
an order is anticipated during the first quarter of vectren energy marketing and services  inc ems  a wholly owned subsidiary  holds the company s investment in proliance 
within the consolidated entity  ems is responsible for certain financing costs associated with proliance and is also responsible for income taxes and allocated corporate expenses related to the company s portion of proliance s results 
during the year ended december   proliance s results  inclusive of financing costs and income taxes  were a loss of approximately million compared to a loss of million in and earnings of million in results in include an million after tax charge associated with proliance s investment in liberty gas storage  as noted below 
in compared to  results at ems related to proliance decreased million 
before the liberty charge  proliance s results decreased approximately million year over year 
the decrease reflects the impacts of new natural gas sources from shale and greater transmission capacity as well as the impacts of reduced industrial demand for natural gas in the midwest 
these conditions have resulted in plentiful natural gas supply and lower and less volatile natural gas prices 
historical basis differences between physical and financial markets and summer and winter prices have narrowed 
as a result  there have been reduced opportunities to optimize proliance s firm transportation and storage capacity 
proliance has structured optimization activities to rem ain flexible to maximize potential opportunities if market conditions improve and has undertaken other actions to improve future results 
however  if current market conditions continue  resulting in continued depressed asset optimization opportunities  it is expected that proliance will experience a loss in given the continuing compressed margins experienced during the first few weeks of  the company currently estimates a first quarter net loss of approximately million to million  compared to first quarter earnings of million  and thereafter results are expected to be about breakeven for the remainder of the year based upon the current market for basis and seasonal spreads 
proliance has approximately million of annual fixed costs related to its transportation and storage contracts  with contracts representing nearly a third of these fixed costs expiring over the next three years and half over the next five years 
at december  proliance continued to maintain significant sources of liquidity beyond its credit facility  which is up for renewal in june  and its balance sheet has million of members equity  no long term debt  and million of working capital debt outstanding  which has now been repaid 
various profit improvement initiatives are underway  including lowering the cost of pipeline demand costs through ongoing pipeline renegotiations 
should market conditions improve from the current depressed levels  proliance s return to profitability would be ac celerated 

table of contents during  proliance s earnings contribution decreased million compared to the decrease reflects the liberty charge and also reflects lower cash to nymex spreads compared to the prior year  particularly spreads existing in the third quarter of that had unprecedented price volatility and resulted in record quarterly earnings from proliance

the liberty pipeline system is currently connected with several interstate pipelines  including the cameron interstate pipeline operated by sempra pipelines storage  and will connect area lng regasification terminals to an interstate natural gas transmission system and storage facilities 
proliance s investment in liberty is million at december   after reflecting the charge discussed below 
in late  se advised proliance that the completion of the phase of liberty s development at the north site had been delayed by subsurface and well completion problems 
based on testing performed in the second quarter of  se determined that attempts at corrective measures had been unsuccessful in development of certain caverns 
at june   liberty recorded a charge of approximately million to write off the north caverns and certain related assets 
as an equity investor in liberty  proliance recorded its share of the charge  totaling million at june  the company s share is million after tax  or per share

liberty received a demand for arbitration from williams midstream natural gas liquids  inc williams on february  related to a sublease agreement sublease between liberty and williams 
williams alleges that liberty was negligent in its attempt to convert certain salt caverns to natural gas storage and thereby damaged the caverns 
williams alleges damages of million 
liberty believes that the claims are without merit and believes that it has complied with all of its obligations to williams and has properly terminated the sublease 
liberty intends to vigorously defend itself and believes it has counterclaims against williams which it will assert in the arbitration proceeding 
liberty has made no accrual for this matter as of december vectren source vectren source  a wholly owned subsidiary  provides natural gas and other related products and services to customers opting for choice among energy providers 
vectren source earned approximately million in  compared to million in and million in results in were lower than the prior year  as expected  due to higher margins on variable priced contracts in the first quarter of during s first quarter  revenues on variable priced sales contracts fell more slowly than gas costs 
results in were impacted by a million gain on the sale of its georgia customer base 
vectren source s customer count at december  was approximately  equivalent customers  compared to  at december  and  at december  the customer count reflects nearly  customers in vedo s service territory that have either voluntarily opted to choose their natural gas supplier or are supplied natural gas by vectren source but remain customers of the regulated utility as part of vedo s exit the merchant function process

impact of recently issued accounting guidance variable interest entities in june  the fasb issued new accounting guidance regarding variable interest entities vie s 
this new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after november  this guidance requires a qualitative analysis of which holder of a variable interest controls the vie and if that interest holder must consolidate a vie 
additionally  it requires additional disclosures and an ongoing reassessment of who must consolidate a vie 
the company adopted this guidance on january  the adoption did not have any impact on the consolidated financial statements 
fair value measurements disclosures in january  the fasb issued new accounting guidance on improving disclosures about fair market value 
this guidance amends prior disclosure requirements involving fair value measurements to add new requirements for disclosures about transfers into and out of levels and and separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements relating to level measurements 
the guidance also clarifies existing fair value disclosures in regard to the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the guidance also amends prior disclosure requirements regarding postretirement benefit plan assets to require that disclosures be provided by classes of assets instead of major categories of assets 
this guidance is effective for the first reporting period beginning after december  the company adopted this guidance for its reporting 
due to the low level of items carried at fair value in the company s financial statements  the adoption has not had any material impact 

table of contents critical accounting policies management is required to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures that conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the consolidated financial statement footnotes describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain estimates used in the financial statements are subjective and use variables that require judgment 
these include the estimates to perform goodwill and other asset impairments tests and to determine pension and postretirement benefit obligations 
the company makes other estimates in the course of accounting for unbilled revenue and the effects of regulation that are critical t o the company s financial results but that are less likely to be impacted by near term changes 
other estimates that significantly affect the company s results  but are not necessarily critical to operations  include depreciating utility and nonutility plant  valuing reclamation liabilities  valuing derivative contracts  and estimating uncollectible accounts and coal reserves  among others 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
impairment review of investments the company has both debt and equity investments in unconsolidated entities 
when events occur that may cause an investment to be impaired  the company performs both a qualitative and quantitative review of that investment and when necessary performs an impairment analysis 
an impairment analysis of notes receivable usually involves the comparison of the investment s estimated free cash flows to the stated terms of the note  or in certain cases for notes that are collateral dependent  a comparison of the collateral s fair value  to the carrying amount of the note 
an impairment analysis of equity investments involves comparison of the investment s estimated fair value to its carrying amount and an assessment of whether any decline in fair value is other than temporary 
fair value is estimated using market comparisons  appraisals  and or discounted cash flow analyses 
calculating free cash flows and fair value using the above methods is subjective and requires judgment concerning growth assumptions  longevity of cash flows  and discount rates for fair value calculations  among others 
the recent economic recession impacted the value of commercial real estate investments within the other businesses nonutility portfolio 
during  the company assessed its commercial real estate investments for impairment using the methods described above and identified the need to reduce their carrying values 
the impairment charge recorded in totaled million 
significant assumptions impacting these analyses were holding periods  net operating income and capitalization rates  which increased during related to capitalization rates  the company used a cap rate in its valuation of a suburban chicago commercial real estate holding owned by the company that is currently vacant and a cap rate in its valuation of leased commercial real estate located in charlotte  nc and birmingham  al that serve as collateral for a note receivable 
a basis point increase in those cap rates would have increased the impairment charge by million 
the company examined these investments for impairment throughout and  noting that current capitalization rates and other assumptions indicate no further impairment 
however  the commercial real estate markets re main soft and uncertain 
should current market conditions continue or worsen  additional impairments could result and actual realized values could differ from the current carrying values 
goodwill intangible assets the company performs an annual impairment analysis of its goodwill  most of which resides in the gas utility services operating segment  at the beginning of each year  and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred 
impairment tests are performed at the reporting unit level 
the company has determined its gas utility services operating segment as identified in note to the consolidated financial statements to be the level at which impairment is tested as its reporting units are similar 
nonutility group reporting units are generally defined as the operating companies that aggregate segments 
an impairment test requires that a reporting unit s fair value be estimated 
the company used a discounted cash flow model and other market based information to estimate the fair value of its gas utility services operating segment  and that estimated fair value was compared to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the estimated fair value has been in excess of the carrying amount in each of the last three years and therefore resulted in no impairment 
goodwill related to the nonutility group is also tested using market comparable data  if readily available  or a discounted cash flow model 

table of contents estimating fair value using a discounted cash flow model is subjective and requires significant judgment in applying a discount rate  growth assumptions  company expense allocations  and longevity of cash flows 
a basis point increase in the discount rate utilized to calculate the gas utility services segment s fair value also would have resulted in no impairment charge 
the company also annually tests non amortizing intangible assets for impairment and amortizing intangible assets are tested on an event and circumstance basis 
during the last three years  these tests yielded no impairment charges 
pension other postretirement obligations the company estimates the expected return on plan assets  discount rate  rate of compensation increase  and future health care costs  among other inputs  and obtains actuarial estimates to assess the future potential liability and funding requirements of the company pension and postretirement plans 
the company used the following weighted average assumptions to develop periodic benefit cost a discount rate of percent  an expected return on plan assets of percent  a rate of compensation increase of percent  and an inflation assumption of percent 
due to the impacts of the recession  these assumptions were each lowered basis points from assumptions used in to estimate costs  the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase  and inflation assumption were percent  percent  percent  and percent respectively  reflecting the lower interest rate environment 
management currently estimates a pension and postretirement cost of approximately million in  compared to approximately million in  million in  and million in future changes in health care costs  work force demographics  interest rates  asset values or plan changes could significantly affect the estimated cost of these future benefits 
management estimates that a basis point decrease in the discount rate used to estimate retirement costs generally increases periodic benefit cost by approximately million to million 
unbilled revenues to more closely match revenues and expenses  the company records revenues for all gas and electricity delivered to customers but not billed at the end of the accounting period 
the company uses actual units billed during the month to allocate unbilled units by customer class 
those allocated units are multiplied by rates in effect during the month to calculate unbilled revenue at balance sheet dates 
regulation at each reporting date  the company reviews current regulatory trends in the markets in which it operates 
this review involves judgment and is critical in assessing the recoverability of regulatory assets as well as the ability to continue to account for its activities based on the criteria set forth in fasb guidance related to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
based on the company s current review  it believes its regulatory assets are probable of recovery 
if all or part of the company operations cease to meet the criteria  a write off of related regulatory assets and liabilities could be required 
in addition  the company would be required to determine any impairment to the carrying value of its utility plant and other regulated assets and liabilities 
 in the unlikely event of a change in the current regulatory environment  such write offs and impairment charges could be significant

additionally  prior to utility holdings formation  indiana gas and sigeco funded their operations separately  and therefore  have long term debt outstanding funded solely by their operations 
sigeco will also occasionally issue tax exempt debt to fund qualifying pollution control capital expenditures 
the company s common stock dividends are primarily funded by utility operations 
nonutility operations have demonstrated profitability and the ability to generate cash flows 
these cash flows are primarily reinvested in other nonutility ventures  but are also used to fund a portion of the company s dividends  and from time to time may be reinvested in utility operations or used for corporate expenses

over the last three years  the company has significantly enhanced its short term borrowing capacity with the completion of several long term financing transactions including issuances of long term debt and the settlement of an equity forward contract 
the company anticipates funding future capital expenditures and dividends through internally generated funds 
in addition  available liquidity is expected to be enhanced by cash resulting from the extension of bonus depreciation legislation 
therefore  management expects that only a portion of the utility holdings million debt redemption due in december needs to be refinanced with new long term debt

consolidated short term borrowing arrangements at december   the company has million of short term borrowing capacity  including million for the utility group and million for the wholly owned nonutility group and corporate operations 
as reduced by borrowings currently outstanding  approximately million was available for the utility group operations and approximately million was available for the wholly owned nonutility group and corporate operations 
these facilities are used to supplement working capital needs and also to fund capital investments and debt redemptions until financed on a long term basis 

table of contents both vectren capital s and utility holdings short term credit facilities were renewed on september  and are available through september during the renewal process  the company lowered the level of capacity due to the reduced requirements for short term borrowings 
the level of short term borrowings is significantly lower compared to historical trends due to the recently completed long term financing transactions  the impacts of additional bonus depreciation and other tax strategies  lower inventory values due to lower natural gas prices  and lower natural gas inventory volumes due to exiting the merchant function in ohio 
the short term borrowing facilities were lowered from million to million for the utility group and from million to million for the nonutilit y group 
in addition  the nonutility group had a million one year credit facility that expired in and was not renewed 
the company has historically funded the short term borrowing needs of utility holdings operations through the commercial paper market and expects to use the utility holdings short term borrowing facility in instances where the commercial paper market is not efficient 
following is certain information regarding these short term borrowing arrangements 
utility group borrowings nonutility group borrowings in millions year end balance outstanding weighted average interest rate annual average balance outstanding weighted average interest rate maximum month end balance outstanding in  the company s access to longer term commercial paper was significantly reduced as a result of the turmoil and volatility in the financial markets 
as a result  the company met short term financing needs through a combination of a p commercial paper issuances and draws on utility holdings back up credit facility 
at december   borrowings outstanding were comprised of million of bank loans at a weighted average interest rate of and million of commercial paper at a weighted average interest rate of 
the average annual balance outstanding in was comprised of million of bank loans at a weighted average interest rate of and million of commercial paper at a weighted average interest rate of 
throughout and most of  the company has placed commercial paper without any significant issues and only had to borrow from its backup credit facility in early on a limited basis 
due to the seasonal nature of the company s business peak borrowing typically occurs during the fourth quarter and therefore the year end balance is typically higher than the average throughout the year

proliance received a quarterly waiver related to that covenant through march  the credit facility expires on june  and will require renegotiation as it is integral to proliance s seasonal liquidity needs 
as of december   borrowings of million were outstanding 
the current facility is not guaranteed by vectren or citizens 
new share issues the company may periodically issue new common shares to satisfy the dividend reinvestment plan  stock option plan and other employee benefit plan requirements 
new issuances added additional liquidity of million in  million in  and million in potential uses of liquidity pension postretirement funding obligations as of december   asset values of the company s qualified pension plans were approximately percent of the projected benefit obligation 
management currently estimates contributing million to qualified pension plans in of that amount  approximately million is made available by bonus depreciation opportunities 
contributions in and beyond are dependent on a variety of factors  including the company s progress toward attaining its long term goal of being fully funded related to the plans accrued benefit obligations and the available sources of cash to fund such additional contributions 
corporate guarantees the company issues corporate guarantees to certain vendors and customers of its wholly owned subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates 
these guarantees do not represent incremental consolidated obligations  rather  they represent parental guarantees of subsidiary and unconsolidated affiliate obligations in order to allow those subsidiaries and affiliates the flexibility to conduct business without posting other forms of collateral 
at december   corporate issued guarantees support a maximum of million of esg s performance contracting commitments and warranty obligations and million of other project guarantees described below 
in addition  the company has approximately million of other guarantees outstanding supporting other consolidated subsidiary operations  of which millio n support the operations of vectren source  a wholly owned nonutility retail gas marketer and million represent letters of credit supporting other nonutility operations 
guarantees issued and outstanding on behalf of unconsolidated affiliates approximated million at december  these guarantees relate primarily to arrangements between proliance and various natural gas pipeline operators 
the company has not been called upon to satisfy any obligations pursuant to these parental guarantees and has accrued no significant liabilities related to these guarantees 
performance guarantees product warranties in the normal course of business  esg  miller  and other wholly owned subsidiaries issue performance bonds or other forms of assurance that commit them to timely install infrastructure  operate facilities  pay vendors or subcontractors  and or support warranty obligations 
based on a history of meeting performance obligations and installed products operating effectively  no significant liability or cost has been recognized during the periods presented 
specific to esg  in its role as a general contractor in the performance contracting industry  at december   there are open surety bonds supporting future performance 
the average face amount of these bonds is million  and the largest obligation has a face amount of million 
the maximum exposure of these obligations is less than these amounts for several factors  including the level of work already completed 
at december   over percent of work was completed on projects with open surety bonds 
a significant portion of these commitments will be fulfilled within one year 
in instances where esg operates facilities  project guarantees extend over a longer period 
in addition to its performance obligations  esg also warrants the functionality of certain inst alled infrastructure generally for one year and the associated energy savings over a specified number of years 

table of contents other letters of credit as of december   utility holdings has letters of credit outstanding in support of two sigeco tax exempt adjustable rate first mortgage bonds totaling million 
in the unlikely event the letters of credit were called  the company could settle with the financial institutions supporting these letters of credit with general assets or by drawing from the renewed credit line that expires in september of due to the long term nature of the credit agreement  such debt is classified as long term at december  planned capital expenditures investments during capital expenditures and other investments approximated million  of which million related to utility group expenditures 
this compares to and where in each year consolidated investments exceeded million with over million attributed to the utility group 
planned utility group capital expenditures  including contractual purchase commitments  for the five year period are expected to be more consistent with expenditures made in and total in millions     and  respectively 
planned nonutility group capital expenditures for mine development and recurring infrastructure investments  including contractual purchase commitments  for the five year period are expected to total in millions     and  respectively 
in addition  the company may expand its infrastructure services business through acquisitions and or make investments in renewable energy projects  among other growth strategies 
the timing and amount of such investments depends on a variety of factors  including the availability of acquisition targets  energy demand  and forecasted liquidity 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of contractual obligations at december  in millions total thereafter long term debt short term debt long term debt interest commitments nonutility transportation storage commitments nonutility commodity purchase commitments plant purchase commitments operating leases total certain long term debt issues contain put and call provisions that can be exercised on various dates before maturity 
these provisions allow holders the one time option to put debt back to the company at face value or the company to call debt at face value or at a premium 
long term debt subject to tender during the years following in millions is in  zero in and thereafter 
the company currently anticipates that only a portion of the utility holdings million maturity due in december will require refinancing 
the million of debt due in was issued by vectren capital 
the company has other long term liabilities that total approximately million 
this amount is comprised of the following pension obligations million  postretirement obligations million  deferred compensation and share based compensation obligations million  asset retirement obligations million  investment tax credits million  environmental remediation obligations million  and other obligations including unrecognized tax benefits totaling million 
based on the nature of these items their expected settlement dates cannot be estimated 
the company s regulated utilities have both firm and non firm commitments to purchase natural gas  electricity  and coal as well as certain transportation and storage rights 
costs arising from these commitments  while significant  are pass through costs  generally collected dollar for dollar from retail customers through regulator approved cost recovery mechanisms 
because of the pass through nature of these costs  they have not been included in the listing of contractual obligations 

table of contents comparison of historical sources uses of liquidity operating cash flow the company primary source of liquidity to fund working capital requirements has been cash generated from operations  which totaled million in  compared to million in and million in the million decrease in operating cash flow in compared to is primarily due to much a greater level of cash generated from working capital in offset by a special dividend from proliance totaling approximately million and higher net income and non cash charges in in  operating cash flows increased million compared to due to increased cash generated from consolidated companies 
this is evident from a million year over year increase in net income before the impacts of depreciation  deferred taxes  equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and other non cash charges 
due principally to lower gas costs  changes in working capital generated million of additional cash flow year over year 
these increases were offset by additional cash uses associated with noncurrent assets and liabilities 
this increased usage is primarily related to a million increase in pension and other retirement plan contributions 
tax payments in the periods presented were favorably impacted by federal legislation extending bonus depreciation and a change in the tax method for recognizing repair and maintenance activities 
federal legislation extending bonus depreciation continues at percent of qualifying capital expenditures in and percent in the company estimates a significant portion of planned capital expenditures in and will qualify for this bonus treatment 
financing cash flow during  and  net cash flow associated with financing activities is reflective of management s ongoing effort to rely less on short term borrowing arrangements 
over the last three years  the company s operating cash flow funded over percent of capital expenditures and dividends in those years  including percent funded in recently completed long term financing transactions have allowed for the repayment of over million in short term borrowings over the past two years  including over million repaid in in addition  these long term financing transactions have financed other capital expenditures on a long term basis

table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various business risks associated with commodity prices  interest rates  and counter party credit 
these financial exposures are monitored and managed by the company as an integral part of its overall risk management program 
the company s risk management program includes  among other things  the use of derivatives 
the company may also execute derivative contracts in the normal course of operations while buying and selling commodities to be used in operations and optimizing its generation assets 
the company has in place a risk management committee that consists of senior management as well as financial and operational management 
the committee is actively involved in identifying risks as well as reviewing and authorizing risk mitigation strategies 
commodity price risk regulated operations the company s regulated operations have limited exposure to commodity price risk for transactions involving purchases and sales of natural gas  coal and purchased power for the benefit of retail customers due to current state regulations  which subject to compliance with those regulations  allow for recovery of the cost of such purchases through natural gas and fuel cost adjustment mechanisms 
constructive regulatory orders  such as those authorizing lost margin recovery  other innovative rate designs  and recovery of unaccounted for gas and other gas related expenses  also mitigate the effect volatile gas costs may have on the company s financial condition 
although vectren s regulated operations are exposed to limited commodity price risk  volatile natural gas prices have other effects on working capital requirements  interest costs  and some level of price sensitivity in volumes sold or delivered 
wholesale power marketing the company s wholesale power marketing activities undertake strategies to optimize electric generating capacity beyond that needed for native load 
in recent years  the primary strategy involves the sale of excess generation into the miso day ahead and real time markets 
as part of these strategies  the company may also from time to time execute energy contracts that commit the company to purchase and sell electricity in future periods 
commodity price risk results from forward positions that commit the company to deliver electricity 
the company mitigates price risk exposure with planned unutilized generation capability 
the company accounts for any energy contracts that are derivatives at fair value with the offset marked to market through earnings 
no market sensi tive derivative positions were outstanding on december  and for retail sales of electricity  the company receives the majority of its nox and so allowances at zero cost through an allocation process 
based on arrangements with regulators  wholesale operations can purchase allowances from retail operations at current market values  the value of which is distributed back to retail customers through a miso cost recovery tracking mechanism 
wholesale operations are therefore at risk for the cost of allowances  which for the recent past have been volatile 
the company manages this risk by purchasing allowances from retail operations as needed and occasionally from other third parties in advance of usage 
in the past  the company also used derivative financial instruments to hedge this risk  but no such derivative instruments were outstanding at december  or other operations other commodity related operations are exposed to commodity price risk associated with natural gas and coal 
other commodity related operations include vectren source  a nonutility retail gas marketer  coal mining operations  and the operations at proliance 
open positions in terms of price  volume  and specified delivery points may occur and are managed using methods described below with frequent management reporting 
these subsidiaries  as well as proliance  purchase and sell natural gas and coal to meet customer demands 
forward contracts  and occasionally option contracts  commit them to purchase and sell commodities in the future 
price risk from forward positions is mitigated using stored inventory and offsetting forward purchase contracts 
price risk also results from forward contracts to purchase commodities to fulfill forecasted non regulated sales of natural gas and coal that may or may not occur 
related to vectren source and coal mining operations  most contracts are expected to be settled by physical receipt or delivery of the commodity 
a small portion of contracts that are derivatives are hedges of forecasted transactions 
proliance more frequently uses financial instrument s that are derivatives to hedge its market exposures that arise from gas in storage  imbalances  and fixed price forward purchase and sale contracts 

table of contents interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its borrowing arrangements 
its risk management program seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that market volatility may have on interest expense 
the company limits this risk by allowing only an annual average of percent to percent of its total debt to be exposed to variable rate volatility 
however  this targeted range may not always be attained during the seasonal increases in short term borrowings 
to manage this exposure  the company may use derivative financial instruments 
market risk is estimated as the potential impact resulting from fluctuations in interest rates on adjustable rate borrowing arrangements exposed to short term interest rate volatility 
during and  the weighted average combined borrowings under these arrangements approximated million and million  respectively 
at december  and  combined borrowings under these arrangements were million and million  respectively 
based upon average borrowing rates under these facilities during the years ended december  and  an increase of basis points one percentage point in the rates would have increased interest expense by approximately million in each year 
other risks by using financial instruments to manage risk  the company  as well as proliance  creates exposure to counter party credit risk and market risk 
the company manages exposure to counter party credit risk by entering into contracts with companies that can be reasonably expected to fully perform under the terms of the contract 
counter party credit risk is monitored regularly and positions are adjusted appropriately to manage risk 
further  tools such as netting arrangements and requests for collateral are also used to manage credit risk 
market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in commodity prices or interest rates 
the company attempts to manage exposure to market risk associated with commodity contracts and interest rates by e stablishing parameters and monitoring those parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken 
the company s customer receivables from gas and electric sales and gas transportation services are primarily derived from residential  commercial  and industrial customers located in indiana and west central ohio 
the company manages credit risk associated with its receivables by continually reviewing creditworthiness and requests cash deposits or refunds cash deposits based on that review 
credit risk associated with certain investments is also managed by a review of creditworthiness and receipt of collateral 
in addition  credit risk is mitigated by regulatory orders that allow recovery of all uncollectible accounts expense in ohio and the gas cost portion of uncollectible accounts expense in indiana based on historical experience
