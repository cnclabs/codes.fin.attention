item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and note to the consolidated financial statements 
market area we own the largest indiana based bank and one of the largest independent insurance agencies headquartered in indiana 
operating from a home base in evansville  indiana  we have continued to grow our footprint in indiana and kentucky with continued expansion in the attractive louisville  indianapolis and lafayette markets 
in february  we expanded into northern indiana by acquiring st 
joseph capital corporation  which had banking offices in mishawaka and elkhart  indiana 
in march  we completed the acquisition of the indiana retail branch banking network of citizens financial group  which consisted of branches and a training facility 
the branches are located primarily in the indianapolis area 
subsequent to year end  we closed on our acquisition of monroe bancorp  strengthening our presence in bloomington  indiana and the central and south central indiana markets 

table of contents the following table reflects the market locations where we have a significant share of the deposit market 
the market share data is by metropolitan statistical area 
the evansville  indiana data includes branches in henderson  kentucky 
old national deposit market share and number of branch locations deposits as of june  number of deposit market market location branches share rank central city  kentucky st danville  illinois st harrisburg  illinois nd evansville  indiana nd terre haute  indiana nd jasper  indiana nd carbondale  illinois nd vincennes  indiana nd washington  indiana nd muncie  indiana rd source fdic acquisition and divestiture strategy since the formation of old national in  we have acquired more than financial institutions and financial services companies 
future acquisitions and divestitures will be driven by a disciplined financial process and will be consistent with the existing focus on community banking  client relationships and consistent quality earnings 
targeted geographic markets for acquisitions include mid size markets within or near our existing franchise with average to above average growth rates 
as with previous acquisitions  the consideration paid by us will be in the form of cash  debt or old national stock 
the amount and structure of such consideration is based on reasonable growth and cost savings assumptions and a thorough analysis of the impact on both long and short term financial results 
subsequent to year end  we acquired monroe bancorp in an all stock transaction 
monroe bancorp is headquartered in bloomington  indiana and has banking centers 
pursuant to the merger agreement  the shareholders of monroe bancorp received approximately million shares of old national bancorp stock valued at approximately million 
on january   unaudited financial statements of monroe bancorp showed assets of million  which included million of loans  million of securities and million of deposits 
the acquisition strengthens our deposit market share in the bloomington  indiana market and should improve our deposit market share rank to first place in competition the banking industry and related financial service providers operate in a highly competitive market 
old national competes with financial service providers such as local  regional and national banking institutions  savings and loan associations  credit unions  finance companies  investment brokers  and mortgage banking companies 
in addition  old national s non bank services face competition with asset managers and advisory services  money market and mutual fund companies and insurance agencies 
supervision and regulation old national is subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws 
the regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors  federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole and not for the protection of shareholders and creditors 

table of contents significant elements of the laws and regulations applicable to old national and its subsidiaries are described below 
the description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes  regulations and policies that are described 
also  such statutes  regulations and policies are continually under review by congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies 
a change in statutes  regulations or regulatory policies applicable to old national and its subsidiaries could have a material effect on the business of the company 
the dodd frank act on july   financial regulatory reform legislation entitled the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act was signed into law 
the dodd frank act implements far reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape  including provisions that  among other things  will centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency  the consumer financial protection bureau  responsible for implementing  examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws 
restrict the preemption of state law by federal law and disallow subsidiaries and affiliates of national banks  such as old national bank  from availing themselves of such preemption 
apply the same leverage and risk based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies  which  among other things  will require old national to deduct  over three years beginning january   all trust preferred securities from old national s tier capital 
require the office of the comptroller of the currency to seek to make its capital requirements for national banks  such as old national bank  countercyclical so that capital requirements increase in times of economic expansion and decrease in times of economic contraction 
require financial holding companies to be well capitalized and well managed as of july  bank holding companies and banks must also be both well capitalized and well managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state 
change the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible capital  eliminate the ceiling on the size of the deposit insurance fund dif and increase the floor of the size of the dif 
impose comprehensive regulation of the over the counter derivatives market  which would include certain provisions that would effectively prohibit insured depository institutions from conducting certain derivatives businesses in the institution itself 
require large  publicly traded bank holding companies to create a risk committee responsible for the oversight of enterprise risk management 
old national already has a risk committee which meets this requirement 
implement corporate governance revisions  including with regard to executive compensation and proxy access by shareholders  that apply to all public companies  not just financial institutions 
make permanent the thousand limit for federal deposit insurance and increase the cash limit of securities investor protection corporation protection from thousand to thousand and provide unlimited federal deposit insurance until december  for noninterest bearing demand transaction accounts at all insured depository institutions 
repeal the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits  thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction accounts as well as other accounts 
amend the electronic fund transfer act efta to  among other things  give the federal reserve the authority to establish rules regarding interchange fees charged for electronic debit transactions by payment card issuers having assets over billion and to enforce a new statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer 
many aspects of the dodd frank act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years  making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on old national  its customers or the financial industry more generally 
provisions in the legislation that affect the payment of interest on demand deposits and interchange fees are likely to increase the costs associated with deposits as well as place limitations on certain revenues those deposits may generate 
provisions in the legislation that revoke the tier capital treatment of trust preferred securities and otherwise require revisions to the capital requirements of old national and old national bank could require old national and old national bank to seek other sources of capital in the future

table of contents item a 
risk factors old national s business could be harmed by any of the risks noted below 
in analyzing whether to make or to continue an investment in old national  investors should consider  among other factors  the following risks related to old national s business economic conditions have affected and could continue to adversely affect our revenues and profits 
from december through june  the us economy was in recession 
business activity across a wide range of industries and regions in the us was greatly reduced 
although economic conditions have begun to improve  certain sectors  such as real estate  remain weak and unemployment remains high 
local governments and many businesses are still in serious difficulty due to lower consumer spending and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets 
market conditions also led to the failure or merger of several prominent financial institutions and numerous regional and community based financial institutions 
these failures  as well as projected future failures  have had a significant negative impact on the capitalization level of the deposit insurance fund of the fdic  which  in turn  has led to a significant increase in deposit insurance premiums paid by financial institutions 
old national s financial performance generally  and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans  as well as demand for loans and other products and services that old national offers  is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where old national operates and in the united states as a whole 
a favorable business environment is generally characterized by  among other factors  economic growth  efficient capital markets  low inflation  low unemployment  high business and investor confidence  and strong business earnings 
unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth  business activity or investor or business confidence  limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital  increases in inflation or interest rates  high unemployment  natural disasters  or a combination of these or other factors 
overall  during the business environment has been adverse for many households and businesses in the united states and worldwide 
while economic conditions in the united states and worldwide have begun to improve  there can be no assurance that this improvement will continue 
such conditions could adversely affect the credit quality of old national s loans  results of operations and financial condition 
in response to economic and market conditions  from time to time we have undertaken initiatives to reduce our cost structure where appropriate 
these initiatives  as well as any future workforce and facilities reductions  may not be sufficient to meet current and future changes in economic and market conditions and allow us to achieve profitability 
in addition  costs actually incurred in connection with our restructuring actions may be higher than our estimates of such costs and or may not lead to the anticipated cost savings 
unless and until the economy  loan demand  credit quality and consumer confidence improve  it is unlikely that revenues will increase significantly  and may be reduced further 
we face risks with respect to future expansion 
we may acquire other financial institutions or parts of those institutions in the future  and we may engage in de novo branch expansion 
we may also consider and enter into new lines of business or offer new products or services 
acquisitions and mergers involve a number of expenses and risks  including the time and costs associated with identifying potential new markets  as well as acquisition and merger targets  the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit  operations  management and market risks with respect to the target institution may not be accurate  
table of contents the time and costs of evaluating new markets  hiring experienced local management and opening new offices  and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion  our ability to finance an acquisition and possible dilution to our existing shareholders  the diversion of our management s attention to the negotiation of a transaction  and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combined businesses  entry into new markets where we lack experience  the introduction of new products and services into our business  the incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and possible adverse short term effects on our results of operations  and the risk of loss of key employees and customers 
we may incur substantial costs to expand  and we can give no assurance such expansion will result in the levels of profits we seek 
there can be no assurance integration efforts for any future mergers or acquisitions will be successful 
also  we may issue equity securities in connection with future acquisitions  which could cause ownership and economic dilution to our current shareholders 
there is no assurance that  following any future mergers or acquisitions  our integration efforts will be successful or that  after giving effect to the acquisition  we will achieve profits comparable to or better than our historical experience 
if old national s actual loan losses exceed old national s allowance for loan losses  old national s net income will decrease 
old national makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of old national s loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of old national s borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of old national s loans 
despite old national s underwriting and monitoring practices  the effect of the declining economy could negatively impact the ability of old national s borrowers to repay loans in a timely manner and could also negatively impact collateral values 
as a result  old national may experience significant loan losses that could have a material adverse effect on old national s operating results 
since old national must use assumptions regarding individual loans and the economy  old national s current allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses 
old national s assumptions may not anticipate the severity or duration of the current credit cycle and old national may need to significantly increase old national s provision for losses on loans if one or more of old national s larger loans or credit relationships becomes delinquent or if old national expands its commercial real estate and commercial lending 
in addition  federal and state regulators periodically review old national s allowance for loan losses and may require old national to increase the provision for loan losses or recognize loan charge offs 
material additions to old national s allowance would materially decrease old national s net income 
there can be no assurance that old national s monitoring procedures and policies will reduce certain lending risks or that old national s allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover actual losses 
old national s loan portfolio includes loans with a higher risk of loss 
old national bank originates commercial real estate loans  commercial loans  agricultural real estate loans  agricultural loans  consumer loans  and residential real estate loans primarily within old national s market areas 
commercial real estate  commercial  consumer  and agricultural loans may expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans may not be sold as easily as residential real estate 
these loans also have greater credit risk than residential real estate for the following reasons commercial real estate loans 
repayment is dependent upon income being generated in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service 

table of contents commercial loans 
repayment is dependent upon the successful operation of the borrower s business 
consumer loans 
consumer loans such as personal lines of credit are collateralized  if at all  with assets that may not provide an adequate source of payment of the loan due to depreciation  damage  or loss 
agricultural loans 
repayment is dependent upon the successful operation of the business  which is greatly dependent on many things outside the control of either old national bank or the borrowers 
these factors include weather  commodity prices  and interest rates 
credit quality issues may continue to broaden in these sectors during depending on the severity and duration of the declining economy and current credit cycle 
if old national forecloses on collateral property  old national may be subject to the increased costs associated with the ownership of real property  resulting in reduced revenues 
old national may have to foreclose on collateral property to protect old national s investment and may thereafter own and operate such property  in which case old national will be exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of real estate 
the amount that old national  as a mortgagee  may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of old national s control  including  but not limited to i general or local economic conditions  ii neighborhood values  iii interest rates  iv real estate tax rates  v operating expenses of the mortgaged properties  vi environmental remediation liabilities  vii ability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties  viii zoning laws  ix governmental rules  regulations and fiscal policies  and x acts of god 
certain expenditures associated with the ownership of real estate  principally real estate taxes  insurance  and maintenance costs  may adversely affect the income from the real estate 
therefore  the cost of operating real property may exceed the income earned from such property  and old national may have to advance funds in order to protect old national s investment  or old national may be required to dispose of the real property at a loss 
the foregoing expenditures and costs could adversely affect old national s ability to generate revenues  resulting in reduced levels of profitability 
old national operates in an extremely competitive market  and old national s business will suffer if old national is unable to compete effectively 
in old national s market area  the company encounters significant competition from other commercial banks  savings and loan associations  credit unions  mortgage banking firms  consumer finance companies securities brokerage firms  insurance companies  money market mutual funds and other financial intermediaries 
the company s competitors may have substantially greater resources and lending limits than old national does and may offer services that old national does not or cannot provide 
old national s profitability depends upon old national s continued ability to compete successfully in old national s market area 
the loss of key members of old national s senior management team could adversely affect old national s business 
old national believes that old national s success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of old national s senior management 
their experience and industry contacts significantly benefit old national 
the competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry is intense  and the loss of any of old national s key personnel or an inability to continue to attract  retain and motivate key personnel could adversely affect old national s business 
a breach of information security or compliance breach by one of our agents or vendors could negatively affect old national s reputation and business 
old national relies upon a variety of computing platforms and networks over the internet for the purposes of data processing  communication and information exchange 
despite the safeguards instituted by old national  such systems are susceptible to a breach of security 
in addition  old national relies on the services of a variety of third party vendors to meet old national s data processing and communication needs 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of old national s information systems or our vendors information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  and expose us to civil litigation and possible financial loss 
such costs and or losses could materially affect old national s earnings 

table of contents fiduciary activity risk factor old national is subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility from time to time  customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to old national s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities 
if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to old national they may result in significant financial liability and or adversely affect the market perception of old national and its products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services 
any financial liability or reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on the old national s business  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on the old national s financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to the banking industry old national operates in a highly regulated environment  and changes in laws and regulations to which old national is subject may adversely affect old national s results of operations 
old national operates in a highly regulated environment and is subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by the office of comptroller of the currency occ  the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve and the state of indiana 
such regulation and supervision of the activities in which an institution may engage is primarily intended for the protection of the depositors and federal deposit insurance funds 
in addition  the treasury has certain supervisory and oversight duties and responsibilities under eesa and the cpp 
see business supervision and regulation herein 
applicable laws and regulations may change  and such changes may adversely affect old national s business 
the dodd frank act  enacted in july  instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes in light of the recent performance of and government intervention in the financial services sector 
in addition  regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities  including but not limited to the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution  the classification of assets by the institution and the adequacy of an institution s allowance for loan losses 
any change in such regulation and oversight  whether in the form of restrictions on activities  regulatory policy  regulations  or legislation  including but not limited to changes in the regulations governing institutions  could have a material impact on old national and its operations 
changes in economic or political conditions could adversely affect old national s earnings  as old national s borrowers ability to repay loans and the value of the collateral securing old national s loans decline 
old national s success depends  to a certain extent  upon economic or political conditions  local and national  as well as governmental monetary policies 
conditions such as recession  unemployment  changes in interest rates  inflation  money supply and other factors beyond old national s control may adversely affect its asset quality  deposit levels and loan demand and  therefore  the old national s earnings 
because old national has a significant amount of commercial real estate loans  decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral 
adverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of old national s borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans  which would have an adverse impact on old national s earnings 
in addition  substantially all of old national s loans are to individuals and businesses in old national s market area 
consequently  any economic decline in old national s primary market areas which include indiana  kentucky and illinois could have an adverse impact on old national s earnings 

table of contents changes in interest rates could adversely affect old national s results of operations and financial condition 
old national s earnings depend substantially on old national s interest rate spread  which is the difference between i the rates old national earns on loans  securities and other earning assets and ii the interest rates old national pays on deposits and other borrowings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond old national s control  including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities 
if market interest rates rise  old national will have competitive pressures to increase the rates old national pays on deposits  which could result in a decrease of old national s net interest income 
if market interest rates decline  old national could experience fixed rate loan prepayments and higher investment portfolio cash flows  resulting in a lower yield on earnings assets 
our internal operations are subject to a number of risks 
old national s internal operations are subject to certain risks  including but not limited to  data processing system failures and errors  customer or employee fraud and catastrophic failures resulting from terrorist acts or natural disasters 
operational risk resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people  and systems includes the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside of our company  the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees  errors relating to transaction processing and systems  and breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements 
this risk of loss also includes potential legal actions that could arise as a result of the operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards 
the banking industry is undergoing technological innovation at a fast pace 
to keep up with its competition  old national needs to stay abreast of innovations and evaluate those technologies that will enable it to compete on a cost effective basis 
the cost of such technology  including personnel  can be high in both absolute and relative terms 
there can be no assurance  given the fast pace of change and innovation  that old national s technology  either purchased or developed internally  will meet or continue to meet the needs of old national 
our earnings could be adversely impacted by incidences of fraud and compliance failures that are not within our direct control 
financial institutions are inherently exposed to fraud risk 
a fraud can be perpetrated by a customer of the bank  an employee  a vendor  or members of the general public 
we are most subject to fraud and compliance risk in connection with the origination of loans  ach transactions  atm transactions and checking transactions 
our largest fraud risk  associated with the origination of loans  includes the intentional misstatement of information in property appraisals or other underwriting documentation provided to us by third parties 
compliance risk is the risk that loans are not originated in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and our standards 
there can be no assurance that we can prevent or detect acts of fraud or violation of law or our compliance standards by the third parties that we deal with 
repeated incidences of fraud or compliance failures would adversely impact the performance of our loan portfolio 
risks related to old national s stock we may not be able to pay dividends in the future in accordance with past practice 
old national has traditionally paid a quarterly dividend to common stockholders 
the payment of dividends is subject to legal and regulatory restrictions 
any payment of dividends in the future will depend  in large part  on old national s earnings  capital requirements  financial condition and other factors considered relevant by old national s board of directors 
the price of old national s common stock may be volatile  which may result in losses for investors 
general market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of old national s common stock 
in addition  the following factors may cause the market price for shares of old national s common stock to fluctuate announcements of developments related to old national s business  fluctuations in old national s results of operations  sales or purchases of substantial amounts of old national s securities in the marketplace  
table of contents general conditions in old national s banking niche or the worldwide economy  a shortfall or excess in revenues or earnings compared to securities analysts expectations  changes in analysts recommendations or projections  and old national s announcement of new acquisitions or other projects

old national also provides services to supplement the traditional banking business including fiduciary and wealth management services  investment and brokerage services  investment consulting  insurance and other financial services 
the company s basic mission is to be the community bank in the cities and towns it serves 
the company focuses on establishing and maintaining long term relationships with customers  and is committed to serving the financial needs of the communities in its market area 
old national provides financial services primarily in indiana  eastern and southeastern illinois  and central and western kentucky 
corporate developments in fiscal from december through june  the us economy was in recession 
business activity across a wide range of industries and regions in the u 
s 
was greatly reduced 
although economic conditions have begun to improve  certain sectors  such as real estate  remain weak and unemployment remains high 
local governments and many businesses are still in serious difficulty due to lower consumer spending and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets 
overall  during  the business environment has been adverse for many households and businesses in our footprint 
while economic conditions in the state of indiana  and the us in general  have begun to improve  there can be no assurance that this improvement will continue 
such conditions could adversely affect the credit quality of our loans  results of operations and financial condition 
net income for was million  an increase of million from diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders were per share  an increase of per share from 
table of contents improvement in net income was primarily due to the following the provision for credit losses declined million due to lower net charge offs  and actions taken by management to reduce non interest expense including an reduction in full time equivalent employees fte and other cost containment efforts 
other significant actions taken during include old national launched two new initiatives designed to increase the speed and simplicity with which certain loan requests can be processed 
the process improvements do not represent a willingness to increase risk  but instead  a better coordination of associates and process flow resulting in shared information that reduces decision making time 
the result has been to better serve our customers while cutting unnecessary time and cost out of the process 
old national announced the acquisition of monroe bancorp based out of bloomington  indiana during the third quarter of this acquisition will add financial centers and increase our presence in central and south central indiana 
during  we continued to reduce long term debt  a more expensive source of funding  as a million senior unsecured note matured and we prepaid million of fhlb advances and million of long term repurchase agreements 
in addition  we redeemed million of trust preferred securities on december  business outlook we believe we will see slow improvement in  but do not anticipate that we will see any improvement in loan demand until unemployment levels improve and there is sustained confidence in the economic recovery 
in addition  it is uncertain how the dodd frank act and other regulatory measures might impact the company 
we do believe that the dodd frank act s repeal of the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits  thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts beginning july   will impact old national 
although the ultimate impact of this legislation on the corporation has not yet been determined  we expect interest costs associated with demand deposits to increase 
our balance sheet has historically been asset sensitive  meaning that earning assets generally re price more quickly than interest bearing liabilities 
therefore  our net interest margin is likely to increase in sustained periods of rising interest rates and decrease in sustained periods of declining interest rates 
our capital levels remain solid and we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of any market disruptions in our footprint 
management will continue to focus on the expense base and process improvement 
we believe these actions should help old national emerge from this extended negative credit cycle as a more efficient and profitable core banking franchise 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain income statement information of old national for the years ended december    and dollars in thousands income statement summary net interest income provision for loan losses noninterest income noninterest expense other data return on average common equity efficiency ratio tier leverage ratio net charge offs to average loans comparison of fiscal years and net interest income net interest income is the most significant component of our earnings  comprising over of revenues 
net interest income and net interest margin in the following discussion are presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis  which adjusts tax exempt interest income to an amount that would be comparable to interest subject to income taxes 
net income is unaffected by these taxable equivalent adjustments as an offsetting increase of the same amount is made in the income tax section 
net interest income includes taxable equivalent adjustments of million for and million for net interest income and margin are influenced by many factors  primarily the volume and mix of earning assets  funding sources and interest rate fluctuations 
other factors include prepayment risk on mortgage and investment related assets and the composition and maturity of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
loans typically generate more interest income than investment securities with similar maturities 
in the current market  certain wholesale funding sources cost less than certain client deposits  however  ordinarily funding from client deposits costs less than wholesale funding sources 
factors  such as general economic activity  federal reserve board monetary policy and price volatility of competing alternative investments  can also exert significant influence on our ability to optimize the mix of assets and funding and the net interest income and margin 
net interest income is the excess of interest received from earning assets over interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
for analytical purposes  net interest income is also presented in the table that follows  adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis to reflect what our tax exempt assets would need to yield in order to achieve the same after tax yield as a taxable asset 
we used the federal statutory tax rate in effect of for all periods adjusted for the tefra interest disallowance applicable to certain tax exempt obligations 
this analysis portrays the income tax benefits associated in tax exempt assets and helps to facilitate a comparison between taxable and tax exempt assets 
management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest margin and net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis 
therefore  management believes these measures provide useful information for both management and investors by allowing them to make peer comparisons 

table of contents dollars in thousands net interest income conversion to fully taxable equivalent net interest income taxable equivalent basis average earning assets net interest margin net interest margin taxable equivalent basis net interest income was million in  a decrease from the million reported in taxable equivalent net interest income was million in  an decrease from the million reported in the net interest margin was for  a basis point decrease compared to the reported in the decrease in both net interest income and net interest margin is primarily due to the decrease in earning asset yield being greater than the decrease in the cost of funding  combined with a change in the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
although the cost of interest bearing liabilities declined by basis points  the decrease was more than offset by the basis decrease in the yield on average assets

average earning assets decreased by million  or 
average interest bearing liabilities decreased million  or 
the decrease in average earning assets consisted of a million increase in lower yielding investment securities  a million decrease in loans and a million increase in money market and other interest earning investments 
the decrease in average interest bearing liabilities consisted of a million decrease in interest bearing deposits  a million decrease in short term borrowings and a million decrease in other borrowings 
noninterest bearing deposits increased by million 
significantly affecting average earning assets during was the increase in the size of the investment portfolio combined with the increase in interest earning cash balances at the federal reserve and the reduction in the size of the loan portfolio 
during  approximately billion of investment securities were purchased and billion of investment securities were called by the issuers or sold

noninterest income we generate revenues in the form of noninterest income through client fees and sales commissions from our core banking franchise and other related businesses  such as wealth management  investment consulting  investment products and insurance

table of contents service charges and overdraft fees on deposit accounts decreased by million to million in as compared to million in the decrease in revenue is primarily attributable to a decrease in fee income for overdrafts and returned items 
service charges and overdraft fees were negatively impacted by new regulatory requirements in the third quarter of the negative impact was partially mitigated with adjustments to our product pricing structure late in the third quarter of debit card and atm fees increased by million to million in as compared to million in the increase in debit card usage is primarily attributable to the citizens financial branch acquisition and an increase in transaction activity 
mortgage banking revenue was million in  a decrease of million as compared to million in mortgage fee revenue declined as a result of our decision to retain more mortgage production and sell less to the secondary market 
insurance premiums and commissions decreased million to million in as compared to million in  primarily as a result of a decrease in contingency income 
revenue from company owned life insurance was million in compared to million in during the third quarter of  the crediting rate formula for the company owned life insurance policy was amended to adopt a more conservative position and improve the overall market to book value ratio 
this change resulted in lower revenues from company owned life insurance in and while revenues slowly improved in and should continue to improve in future years  we anticipate revenue will remain below levels in future years

financial condition overview at december   our total assets were billion  a decrease from billion at december  the decrease in investment security balances  interest earning cash balances and loan balances over the past twelve months has allowed us to reduce our reliance on higher cost deposits and wholesale funding

weak loan demand in our markets continues to affect loan growth 
our conservative underwriting standards have also contributed to slower loan growth 
we continue to be cautious towards the real estate market in an effort to lower credit risk 
the following table presents the maturity distribution and rate sensitivity of commercial loans and an analysis of these loans that have predetermined and floating interest rates

residential real estate loans residential real estate loans  primarily family properties  were million at december   an increase of million or from december  the majority of the growth in residential real estate loans came in the fourth quarter of  primarily as a result of a new mortgage product that was introduced 
we usually sell the majority of residential real estate loans originated as a strategy to better manage interest rate risk and liquidity 
typically  we sell almost all residential real estate loans servicing released without recourse 
however  the majority of new loan production during was retained in our loan portfolio 

table of contents allowance for loan losses to provide for the risk of loss inherent in extending credit  we maintain an allowance for loan losses 
the determination of the allowance is based upon the size and current risk characteristics of the loan portfolio and includes an assessment of individual problem loans  actual loss experience  current economic events and regulatory guidance

the reserve for residential real estate loans as a percentage of that portfolio decreased to at december   from at december  the reserve for consumer loans decreased to at december   from at december  the lower reserve percentages for these portfolios are a result of improved credit quality in these portfolios during allowance for losses on unfunded commitments we maintain an allowance for losses on unfunded commercial lending commitments and letters of credit to provide for the risk of loss inherent in these arrangements 
the allowance is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for loan losses  modified to take into account the probability of a drawdown on the commitment 
this allowance is reported as a liability on the balance sheet within accrued expenses and other liabilities  while the corresponding provision for these loan losses is recorded as a component of other expense

risk management overview management  with the oversight of the board of directors through its risk and credit policy committee  has in place company wide structures  processes  and controls for managing and mitigating risk 
the following discussion addresses the three major risks we face credit  market  and liquidity 
credit risk credit risk represents the risk of loss arising from an obligor s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms 
our primary credit risks result from our investment and lending activities 
investment activities within our securities portfolio  the non agency collateralized mortgage obligations represent the greatest exposure to the current instability in the residential real estate and credit markets 
at december   we had non agency collateralized mortgage obligations with a market value of million  or approximately of the available for sale securities portfolio 
the unrealized loss on these securities at december   was approximately million 
we expect conditions in the overall residential real estate market to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future 
deterioration in the performance of the underlying loan collateral could result in deterioration in the performance of our asset backed securities 
during the fourth quarter of we sold two non agency mortgage backed securities with an amortized cost basis of approximately million that were below investment grade 
eight of these securities were rated below investment grade as of december  during we experienced million of other than temporary impairment losses on ten of these securities  of which million was recorded as a credit loss in earnings and million is included in other comprehensive income 
during we experienced million of other than temporary impairment on these ten securities  of which million was recorded as a credit loss in earnings and million was included in other comprehensive income 
we also carry a higher exposure to loss in our pooled trust preferred securities  which are collateralized debt obligations  due to illiquidity in that market and the performance of the underlying collateral 
at december   we had pooled trust preferred securities with a fair value of approximately million  or of the available for sale securities portfolio 
during  we experienced million of other than temporary impairment on three of these securities  all of which was recorded as a credit loss in earnings 
these securities remained classified as available for sale and at december   the unrealized loss on our pooled trust preferred securities was approximately million 
during  six of these securities experienced million of other than temporary impairment  of which million was recorded as a credit loss in earnings and million was included in other comprehensive income 

table of contents the remaining mortgage backed securities are backed by us government sponsored or federal agencies 
municipal bonds  corporate bonds and other debt securities are evaluated by reviewing the credit worthiness of the issuer and general market conditions 
we do not have the intent to sell these securities and it is likely that we will not be required to sell these securities before their anticipated recovery 
included in the held to maturity category at december  are approximately million of agency mortgage backed securities and million of municipal securities at amortized cost 
counterparty exposure counterparty exposure is the risk that the other party in a financial transaction will not fulfill its obligation in a financial transaction 
we define counterparty exposure as nonperformance risk in transactions involving federal funds sold and purchased  repurchase agreements  correspondent bank relationships  and derivative contracts with companies in the financial services industry 
old national s net counterparty exposure was an asset of million at december  lending activities commercial commercial and industrial loans are made primarily for the purpose of financing equipment acquisition  expansion  working capital  and other general business purposes 
lease financing consists of direct financing leases and are used by commercial customers to finance capital purchases ranging from computer equipment to transportation equipment 
the credit decisions for these transactions are based upon an assessment of the overall financial capacity of the applicant 
a determination is made as to the applicant s ability to repay in accordance with the proposed terms as well as an overall assessment of the risks involved 
in addition to an evaluation of the applicant s financial condition  a determination is made of the probable adequacy of the primary and secondary sources of repayment  such as additional collateral or personal guarantees  to be relied upon in the transaction 
credit agency reports of the applicant s credit history supplement the analysis of the applicant s creditworthiness 
commercial mortgages and construction loans are offered to real estate investors  developers  and builders primarily domiciled in the geographic market areas we serve  primarily indiana  illinois and kentucky 
these loans are secured by first mortgages on real estate at loan to value ltv margins deemed appropriate for the property type  quality  location and sponsorship 
generally  these ltv ratios do not exceed 
the commercial properties are predominantly non residential properties such as retail centers  apartments  industrial properties and  to a lesser extent  more specialized properties 
substantially all of our commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located in our primary market area 
in the underwriting of our commercial real estate loans  we obtain appraisals for the underlying properties 
decisions to lend are based on the economic viability of the property and the creditworthiness of the borrower 
in evaluating a proposed commercial real estate loan  we primarily emphasize the ratio of the property s projected net cash flows to the loan s debt service requirement 
the debt service coverage ratio normally is not less than and it is computed after deduction for a vacancy factor and property expenses as appropriate 
in addition  a personal guarantee of the loan or a portion thereof is sometimes required from the principal s of the borrower 
we require title insurance insuring the priority of our lien  fire  and extended coverage casualty insurance  and flood insurance  if appropriate  in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property 
in addition  business interruption insurance or other insurance may be required 
construction loans are underwritten against projected cash flows derived from rental income  business income from an owner occupant or the sale of the property to an end user 
we may mitigate the risks associated with these types of loans by requiring fixed price construction contracts  performance and payment bonding  controlled disbursements  and pre sale contracts or pre lease agreements 

table of contents consumer we offer a variety of first mortgage and junior lien loans to consumers within our markets with residential home mortgages comprising our largest consumer loan category 
these loans are secured by a primary residence and are underwritten using traditional underwriting systems to assess the credit risks of the consumer 
decisions are primarily based on ltv ratios  debt to income dti ratios  liquidity and credit score 
a maximum ltv ratio of is generally required  although higher levels are permitted with mortgage insurance 
we offer fixed rate mortgages and variable rate mortgages with interest rates that are subject to change every year after the first  third  fifth  or seventh year  depending on the product and are based on the london interbank offered rate libor 
variable rate mortgages are underwritten at fully indexed rates 
we do not offer interest only loans  payment option facilities  sub prime loans  or any product with negative amortization 
home equity loans are secured primarily by second mortgages on residential property of the borrower 
the underwriting terms for the home equity product generally permits borrowing availability  in the aggregate  up to of the appraised value of the collateral property at the time of origination 
we offer fixed and variable rate home equity loans  with variable rate loans underwritten at fully indexed rates 
decisions are primarily based on ltv ratios  dti ratios  liquidity  and credit scores 
we do not offer home equity loan products with reduced documentation 
automobile loans include loans and leases secured by new or used automobiles 
we originate automobile loans and leases primarily on an indirect basis through selected dealerships 
we require borrowers to maintain collision insurance on automobiles securing consumer loans  with us listed as loss payee 
our procedures for underwriting automobile loans include an assessment of an applicant s overall financial capacity  including credit history and the ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan 
although an applicant s creditworthiness is the primary consideration  the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral security to the proposed loan amount 
asset quality community based lending personnel  along with region based independent underwriting and analytic support staff  extend credit under guidelines established and administered by our risk and credit policy committee 
this committee  which meets quarterly  is made up of outside directors 
the committee monitors credit quality through its review of information such as delinquencies  credit exposures  peer comparisons  problem loans and charge offs 
in addition  the committee reviews and approves recommended loan policy changes to assure it remains appropriate for the current lending environment 
we lend primarily to small and medium sized commercial and commercial real estate clients in various industries including manufacturing  agribusiness  transportation  mining  wholesaling and retailing 
at december   we had no concentration of loans in any single industry exceeding of our portfolio and had no exposure to foreign borrowers or lesser developed countries 
our policy is to concentrate our lending activity in the geographic market areas we serve  primarily indiana  illinois and kentucky 
we continue to be affected by weakness in the economy of our principal markets 
management expects that trends in under performing  criticized and classified loans will be influenced by the degree to which the economy strengthens or weakens 

table of contents summary of under performing  criticized and classified assets asset quality dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans commercial commercial real estate residential real estate consumer total nonaccrual loans renegotiated loans not on nonaccrual past due loans still accruing days or more commercial commercial real estate residential real estate consumer total past due loans foreclosed properties total under performing assets classified loans includes nonaccrual  renegotiated  past due days and other problem loans other classified assets criticized loans total criticized and classified assets asset quality ratios non performing loans total loans under performing assets total loans and foreclosed properties under performing assets total assets allowance for loan losses under performing assets loans exclude residential loans held for sale and leases held for sale 
non performing loans include nonaccrual and renegotiated loans 
includes pooled trust preferred securities  non agency mortgage backed securities and corporate security at december  under performing assets are closely monitored by our management and consist of nonaccrual loans  where the ultimate collectibility of interest or principal is uncertain  loans renegotiated in some manner  primarily to provide for a reduction or deferral of interest or principal payments because the borrower s financial condition deteriorated  loans with principal or interest past due ninety days or more  and foreclosed properties 
under performing assets totaled million at december  and million at december  as a percent of total loans and foreclosed properties  under performing assets at december were for and for the nonaccrual category of under performing loans was million at december   compared to million at december  at december   the allowance for loan losses to under performing assets ratio stood at compared to at december  in the course of resolving nonperforming loans  we may choose to restructure the contractual terms of certain loans 
we attempt to work out an alternative payment schedule with the borrower in order to avoid foreclosure actions 
any loans that are modified are reviewed by us to identify if a troubled debt restructuring tdr has occurred  which is when for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower s financial difficulties  the bank grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider 
terms may be modified to fit the ability of the borrower to repay in line with its current financial status and could include reduction of the stated interest rate other than normal market rate adjustments  extension of maturity dates  or reduction of principal balance or accrued interest 
the decision to restructure a loan  versus aggressively enforcing the collection of the loan  may benefit us by increasing the ultimate probability of collection 

table of contents loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring are placed on nonaccrual status until the company determines the future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured  which generally requires that the borrower demonstrate a period of performance according to the restructured terms of six months 
all of our troubled debt restructurings were included with nonaccrual loans at december  and consisted of million of commercial loans and million of commercial real estate loans 
all of our troubled debt restructurings were included with nonaccrual loans at december  and consisted of million of commercial loans and million of commercial real estate loans 
in addition  the company modified one loan during the fourth quarter of that was not considered a troubled debt restructuring 
the loan had a balance of million at december  the loan modification was in the commercial loan portfolio and resulted in an insignificant delay in payments  which was considered along with other factors 
the loan was paid in full in the third quarter of management will continue its efforts to reduce the level of under performing loans and will also consider the possibility of sales of troubled and non performing loans  which could result in additional charge offs to the allowance for loan losses 
classified loans  including nonaccrual  renegotiated  past due days and other problem loans  were million at december   an increase of million from million at december  of this total  other problem loans  which are loans reviewed for the borrowers ability to comply with present repayment terms  totaled million at december   compared to million at december  other classified assets include million of investment securities that fell below investment grade rating at december  criticized loans  or special mention loans  were million at december   a decrease of million from million at december  management believes it has taken a prudent approach to the evaluation of under performing  criticized and classified loans  and the loan portfolio in general both in acknowledging the portfolio s general condition and in establishing the allowance for loan losses 
loan officers and credit underwriters jointly grade the larger commercial and commercial real estate loans in the portfolio periodically as determined by loan policy requirements or determined by specific guidelines based on loan characteristics as set by management and banking regulation 
periodically  these loan grades are reviewed independently by the loan review department 
for impaired loans  an assessment is conducted as to whether there is likely loss in the event of default 
if such a loss is determined to be likely  the loss is quantified and a specific reserve is assigned to the loan 
for the balance of the commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolio  loan grade migration analysis coupled with historic loss experience within the respective grades is used to develop reserve requirement ranges 
these reserve requirement ranges are adjusted for management s best estimate of the effects of current economic conditions  loan quality trends  results from internal and external review examinations  loan volume trends  credit concentrations and various other factors 
historic loss ratios adjusted for expectations of future economic conditions are used in determining the appropriate level of reserves for consumer and residential real estate loans

net charge offs include write downs on loans transferred to held for sale 
the allowance for loan losses increased million from million at december  to million at december  the primary reasons for the increase in the allowance from december  to december  were an increase of approximately million in general allocation related to credit deterioration in the commercial portfolio combined with an increase in specific loan allocations of approximately million in the commercial portfolio  which more than offset the million reduction for residential loans 
management believes that it has appropriately identified and reserved for its loan losses at december  management will continue its efforts to reduce the level of non performing loans and may consider the possibility of additional sales of troubled and non performing loans  which could result in additional write downs to the allowance for loan losses 
interest income of approximately million and million would have been recorded on nonaccrual and renegotiated loans outstanding at december  and  respectively  if such loans had been accruing interest throughout the year in accordance with their original terms

interest rate risk is our primary market risk and results from timing differences in the re pricing of assets and liabilities  changes in the slope of the yield curve  and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options 
we manage interest rate risk within an overall asset and liability management framework that includes attention to credit risk  liquidity risk and capitalization 
a principal objective of asset liability management is to manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changing interest rates 
asset and liability management activity is governed by a policy reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors 
the board of directors has delegated the administration of this policy to the funds management committee  a committee of the board of directors  and the executive balance sheet management committee  a committee comprised of senior executive management 
the funds management committee meets quarterly and oversees adherence to policy and recommends policy changes to the board 
the executive balance sheet management committee meets at least quarterly 
this committee determines balance sheet management strategies and initiatives for the company 
a group comprised of corporate and line management meets monthly to implement strategies and initiatives determined by the executive balance sheet management committee 
we use two modeling techniques to quantify the impact of changing interest rates on the company  net interest income at risk and economic value of equity 
net interest income at risk is used by management and the board of directors to evaluate the impact of changing rates over a two year horizon 
economic value of equity is used to evaluate long term interest rate risk 
these models simulate the likely behavior of our net interest income and the likely change in our economic value due to changes in interest rates under various possible interest rate scenarios 
because the models are driven by expected behavior in various interest rate scenarios and many factors besides market interest rates affect our net interest income and value  we recognize that model outputs are not guarantees of actual results 
for this reason  we model many different combinations of interest rates and balance sheet assumptions to understand our overall sensitivity to market interest rate changes 

table of contents old national s board of directors  through its funds management committee  monitors our interest rate risk 
policy guidelines  in addition to december  and results are as follows net interest income month policies interest rate change in basis points bp down down down up up up green zone yellow zone to to to to to to red zone na na na na na na net interest income month cumulative policies interest rate change in basis points bp down down down up up up green zone yellow zone to to to to to to red zone na na na na na na economic value of equity policies interest rate change in basis points bp down down down up up up green zone yellow zone to to to to to to red zone na na na na na na red zone policy limits represent our normal absolute interest rate risk exposure compliance limit 
policy limits defined as green zone represent the range of potential interest rate risk exposures that the funds management committee believes to be normal and acceptable operating behavior 
yellow zone policy limits represent a range of interest rate risk exposures falling below the bank s maximum allowable exposure red zone but above its normally acceptable interest rate risk levels green zone 
policy limits are applicable to negative changes in net interest income at risk and economic value of equity 
modeling for the down basis points  down basis points  and down basis points scenarios for both the net interest income at risk and economic value of equity are not applicable in the current rate environment because the scenarios floor at zero before absorbing the full   and basis point drop  respectively 
at december   modeling indicated old national was within the green zone policy limit for the month net interest income at risk values for up  up and up scenarios  which is considered normal and acceptable for net interest income at risk 
negative results for the month net interest income at risk indicate that net interest income decreases relative to net interest income modeled using interest rates as of december  results for the cumulative month net interest income at risk were positive for up  up and up scenarios 
this indicates that net interest income increases relative to net interest income modeled using interest rates as of december  positive increases to net interest income at risk in our scenarios are not applicable to policy limits 

table of contents at december   modeling indicated that old national was within the green zone policy limit for the up  up  and up economic value of equity scenarios  which is considered normal and acceptable for economic value of equity scenarios 
old national s economic value of equity eve scenarios indicated more negative changes to economic value in rising interest rate scenarios at december  compared to december  these changes in eve modeling results were primarily driven by mix changes within in the balance sheet 
additionally  eve results were also impacted by a smaller balance sheet  which included a reduction in the size of the investment portfolio and wholesale funding and a change in the mix within the loan portfolio 
in addition to policy defined scenarios  old national models other scenarios to measure interest rate risk 
for example  the company models a yield curve based on a month forward curve 
the forward curve represents the market s expectations of future interest rates 
as of december   old national s month cumulative net interest income at risk for this scenario resulted in a increase in net interest income over an unchanged interest rate curve 
in addition  old national models a ramp scenario where current interest rates are increased basis points each quarter over a month timeframe 
as of december   old national s month cumulative net interest income at risk for this scenario resulted in a decrease in net interest income over an unchanged interest rate curve 
we use derivatives  primarily interest rate swaps  as one method to manage interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business 
our derivatives had an estimated fair value gain of million at december   compared to an estimated fair value gain of million at december  in addition  the notional amount of derivatives decreased by million from see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivative financial instruments 
liquidity risk liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments  or may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources 
the funds management committee of the board of directors establishes liquidity risk guidelines and  along with the balance sheet management committee  monitors liquidity risk 
the objective of liquidity management is to ensure we have the ability to fund balance sheet growth and meet deposit and debt obligations in a timely and cost effective manner 
management monitors liquidity through a regular review of asset and liability maturities  funding sources  and loan and deposit forecasts 
we maintain strategic and contingency liquidity plans to ensure sufficient available funding to satisfy requirements for balance sheet growth  properly manage capital markets funding sources and to address unexpected liquidity requirements 
loan repayments and maturing investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds 
however  deposit flows  calls of investment securities and prepayments of loans and mortgage related securities are strongly influenced by interest rates  the housing market  general and local economic conditions  and competition in the marketplace 
we continually monitor marketplace trends to identify patterns that might improve the predictability of the timing of deposit flows or asset prepayments 
our ability to acquire funding at competitive prices is influenced by rating agencies views of our credit quality  liquidity  capital and earnings 
all of the rating agencies place us in an investment grade that indicates a low risk of default

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for the year ended december  certain accounting policies require management to use significant judgment and estimates  which can have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
we consider these policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgment and assumptions made are based upon historical experience or other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgment and assumptions  actual results could differ from estimates  which could have a material affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the following accounting policies materially affect our reported earnings and financial condition and require significant judgments and estimates 
management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board 
goodwill and intangibles description 
for acquisitions  we are required to record the assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  and the liabilities assumed at their fair value 
these often involve estimates based on third party valuations  such as appraisals  or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques that may include estimates of attrition  inflation  asset growth rates or other relevant factors 
in addition  the determination of the useful lives over which an intangible asset will be amortized is subjective 
under fasb asc sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and indefinite lived assets recorded must be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis  as well as on an interim basis if events or changes indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss must be recognized for any excess of carrying value over fair value of the goodwill or the indefinite lived intangible asset 
judgments and uncertainties 
the determination of fair values is based on internal valuations using management s assumptions of future growth rates  future attrition  discount rates  multiples of earnings or other relevant factors 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions 
changes in these factors  as well as downturns in economic or business conditions  could have a significant adverse impact on the carrying values of goodwill or intangible assets and could result in impairment losses affecting the financials of the company as a whole and the individual lines of business in which the goodwill or intangibles reside 
allowance for loan losses description 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable incurred losses in the consolidated loan portfolio 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is an estimate based on reviews of individual loans  pools of homogeneous loans  assessments of the impact of current and anticipated economic conditions on the portfolio and historical loss experience 
the allowance represents management s best estimate  but significant downturns in circumstances relating to loan quality and economic conditions could result in a requirement for additional allowance 
likewise  an upturn in loan quality and improved economic conditions may allow a reduction in the required allowance 
in either instance  unanticipated changes could have a significant impact on results of operations 
the allowance is increased through a provision charged to operating expense 
uncollectible loans are charged off through the allowance 
recoveries of loans previously charged off are added to the allowance 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that contractual interest and principal payments will not be collected either for the amounts or by the dates as scheduled in the loan agreement 
our policy for recognizing income on impaired loans is to accrue interest unless a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
a loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest becomes days past due unless it is well secured and in the process of collection  or earlier when concern exists as to the ultimate 
table of contents collectibility of principal or interest 
we monitor the quality of our loan portfolio on an on going basis and use a combination of detailed credit assessments by relationship managers and credit officers  historic loss trends  and economic and business environment factors in determining the allowance for loan losses 
we record provisions for loan losses based on current loans outstanding  grade changes  mix of loans and expected losses 
a detailed loan loss evaluation on an individual loan basis for our highest risk loans is performed quarterly 
management follows the progress of the economy and how it might affect our borrowers in both the near and the intermediate term 
we have a formalized and disciplined independent loan review program to evaluate loan administration  credit quality and compliance with corporate loan standards 
this program includes periodic reviews and regular reviews of problem loan reports  delinquencies and charge offs 
judgments and uncertainties 
we use migration analysis as a tool to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses for performing commercial loans 
migration analysis is a statistical technique that attempts to estimate probable losses for existing pools of loans by matching actual losses incurred on loans back to their origination 
judgment is used to select and weight the historical periods which are most representative of the current environment 
we calculate migration analysis using several different scenarios based on varying assumptions to evaluate the widest range of possible outcomes 
the migration derived historical commercial loan loss rates are applied to the current commercial loan pools to arrive at an estimate of probable losses for the loans existing at the time of analysis 
the amounts determined by migration analysis are adjusted for management s best estimate of the effects of current economic conditions  loan quality trends  results from internal and external review examinations  loan volume trends  credit concentrations and various other factors 
we use historic loss ratios adjusted for expectations of future economic conditions to determine the appropriate level of allowance for consumer and residential real estate loans 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions 
the allowance represents management s best estimate  but significant downturns in circumstances relating to loan quality and economic conditions could result in a requirement for additional allowance 
likewise  an upturn in loan quality and improved economic conditions may allow a reduction in the required allowance 
in either instance  unanticipated changes could have a significant impact on results of operations 
management s analysis of probable losses in the portfolio at december   resulted in a range for allowance for loan losses of million 
the range pertains to general fasb asc  receivables sfas reserves for both retail and performing commercial loans 
specific fasb asc  receivables sfas reserves do not have a range of probable loss 
due to the risks and uncertainty associated with the economy  our projection of fas loss rates inherent in the portfolio  and our selection of representative historical periods  we establish a range of probable outcomes a high end estimate and a low end estimate and evaluate our position within this range 
the potential effect to net income based on our position in the range relative to the high and low endpoints is a decrease of million and an increase of million  respectively  after taking into account the tax effects 
these sensitivities are hypothetical and are not intended to represent actual results 
derivative financial instruments description 
as part of our overall interest rate risk management  we use derivative instruments to reduce exposure to changes in interest rates and market prices for financial instruments 
the application of the hedge accounting policy requires judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness  identification of similar hedged item groupings and measurement of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and hedged items 
to the extent hedging relationships are found to be effective  as determined by fasb asc sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  changes in fair value of the derivatives are offset by changes in the fair value of the related hedged item or recorded to other comprehensive income 
management believes hedge effectiveness is evaluated properly in preparation of the financial statements 
all of the derivative financial instruments we use have an active market and indications of fair value can be readily obtained 
we are not using the short cut method of accounting for any fair value derivatives 

table of contents judgments and uncertainties 
the application of the hedge accounting policy requires judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness  identification of similar hedged item groupings and measurement of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and hedged items 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions 
to the extent hedging relationships are found to be effective  as determined by fasb asc sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  changes in fair value of the derivatives are offset by changes in the fair value of the related hedged item or recorded to other comprehensive income 
however  if in the future the derivative financial instruments used by us no longer qualify for hedge accounting treatment  all changes in fair value of the derivative would flow through the consolidated statements of income in other noninterest income  resulting in greater volatility in our earnings 
income taxes description 
we are subject to the income tax laws of the us  its states and the municipalities in which we operate 
these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities 
we review income tax expense and the carrying value of deferred tax assets quarterly  and as new information becomes available  the balances are adjusted as appropriate 
fasb asc fin prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not  and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of our provision and related income tax assets and liabilities 
judgments and uncertainties 
in establishing a provision for income tax expense  we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws 
we must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions 
disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review adjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions 
although management believes that the judgments and estimates used are reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves  our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement would result in a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
valuation of securities description 
the fair value of our securities is determined with reference to price estimates 
in the absence of observable market inputs related to items such as cash flow assumptions or adjustments to market rates  management judgment is used 
different judgments and assumptions used in pricing could result in different estimates of value 
when the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost for an extended period  we consider whether there is an other than temporary impairment in the value of the security 
if  in management s judgment  an other than temporary impairment exists  the portion of the loss in value attributable to credit quality is transferred from accumulated other comprehensive loss as an immediate reduction of current earnings and the cost basis of the security is written down by this amount 

table of contents we consider the following factors when determining an other than temporary impairment for a security or investment the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  the underlying fundamentals of the relevant market and the outlook for such market for the near future  our intent to sell the debt security or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery  and when applicable for purchased beneficial interests  the estimated cash flows of the securities are assessed for adverse changes 
quarterly  securities are evaluated for other than temporary impairment in accordance with fasb asc sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and fasb asc emerging issues task force no 
 recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interest in securitized financial assets and fasb asc fsp no 
fas and fas  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments 
an impairment that is an other than temporary impairment is a decline in the fair value of an investment below its amortized cost attributable to factors that indicate the decline will not be recovered over the anticipated holding period of the investment 
other than temporary impairments result in reducing the security s carrying value by the amount of credit loss 
the credit component of the other than temporary impairment loss is realized through the statement of income and the remainder of the loss remains in other comprehensive income 
judgments and uncertainties 
the determination of other than temporary impairment is a subjective process  and different judgments and assumptions could affect the timing and amount of loss realization 
in addition  significant judgments are required in determining valuation and impairment  which include making assumptions regarding the estimated prepayments  loss assumptions and interest cash flows 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions 
actual credit deterioration could be more or less severe than estimated 
upon subsequent review  if cash flows have significantly improved  the discount would be amortized into earnings over the remaining life of the debt security in a prospective manner based on the amount and timing of future cash flows 
additional credit deterioration resulting in an adverse change in cash flows would result in additional other than temporary impairment loss recorded in the income statement 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to it in this management s discussion and analysis
