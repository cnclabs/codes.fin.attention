item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
general we divide our business into three distinct segments for both management and reporting purposes fuel specialties  active chemicals and octane additives 
the fuel specialties and active chemicals businesses operate in markets where we actively seek growth opportunities 
the octane additives business is characterized by declining demand 
the fuel specialties business develops  manufactures  blends and markets a range of specialty chemical products used as additives to a wide range of fuels 
the business grew initially through a program of acquisitions and more recently  organically  through the development of new products  and increases in sales and profitability 
the active chemicals business provides effective technology based solutions for our customers processes or products focused in the personal care  household  industrial institutional  and fragrance ingredients markets 
this business has also grown through acquisitions and more recently through the development and marketing of innovative products to the personal care and fragrance industries 
the octane additives business is the world s only producer of tetra ethyl lead tel for use in automotive gasoline and trading in respect of our environmental remediation business 
we are continuing to manage the decrease in the sales of tel for use in automotive gasoline to maximize the cash flow through the decline 
continuous cost improvement measures have been  and will continue to be  taken to respond to declining market demand 
for the year ended december   the combined operating income of the fuel specialties and active chemicals segments of our business has grown by an average of per annum  as compared with the year ended december   and now drives the operating income generated by our businesses 
by comparison operating income for the octane additives segment declined from million to million over the same period 
the octane additives segment of our business will continue to decline as the last remaining countries that continue to allow tel for use in automotive gasoline move away from leaded gasoline 
we expect that we will cease all sales of tel for use in automotive gasoline in  and that we will continue to impair the octane additives business goodwill until or prior to that point 
however  we have succeeded in implementing our strategic plan of creating sufficient growth in the fuel specialties and active chemicals segments of our business to more than offset the decline in the octane additives business 
we use a variety of raw materials and chemicals in our manufacturing and blending processes and believe that sources for these are adequate for our current operations 
raw materials account for a substantial portion of our variable manufacturing costs 
these materials are  with 
table of contents the exception of ethylene in germany  readily available from more than one source 
we use long term contracts generally with fixed costs or formula based costs to help ensure availability and continuity of supply  and to manage the risk of cost increases 
for some raw materials the risk of cost increases is managed with commodity swaps 
nevertheless  raw materials are subject to cost fluctuations and we may be exposed to risk as costs of these raw materials increase as a result of factors that are not within our control 
we are subject to extensive regulation by local  state  federal and foreign government authorities both with respect to the methods by which we manufacture and market products and how we conduct our business 
in that regard  we are exposed to risks that we may incur liabilities and costs in order to conform to required regulations or in the event that we fail to comply with any laws or regulations 
critical accounting estimates our objective is to clearly present our financial information in a manner that enhances the understanding of our sources of earnings and cash flows together with our financial position 
we aim to achieve this by disclosing information required by the sec together with further information that provides insight into our businesses 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses innospec s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management evaluates on an on going basis its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
our consolidated financial statements and supplementary data disclose our accounting principles and the methods and estimates used in the preparation of those consolidated financial statements 
we believe those statements and disclosures represent fairly the results of operations  financial position and cash flows of the company 
the purpose of this portion of our report is to further emphasize some of the more critical areas where a significant change in facts and circumstances in our operating and financial environment could cause a change in results of operations or financial position 
the policies and estimates that the company considers the most critical in terms of subjectivity and judgment of assessment are provided below 

table of contents contingencies we are subject to legal  regulatory and other proceedings and claims 
the company discloses information concerning contingent liabilities in respect of these claims and proceedings for which an unfavorable outcome is more than remote and the potential loss could materially impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
we recognize liabilities for these claims and proceedings when it is probable that the company has incurred a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated and to fairly present  in conjunction with the disclosures of these matters in our consolidated financial statements  management s view of our exposure 
we review outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel as appropriate to assess probability and estimates of loss 
the company will recognize within selling  general and administrative expenses a liability related to claims and proceedings at such time as an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
when the reasonable estimate is a range  the recognized liability will be the best estimate within the range 
if no amount in the range is a better estimate than any other amount then the minimum amount of the range will be recognized 
the company recognizes its legal and other related professional expenses within selling  general and administrative expenses as and when the associated course of action is committed to 
we re evaluate these assessments each quarter or as new and significant information becomes available to determine whether a liability should be recognized or if any existing liability should be adjusted 
the actual cost of ultimately resolving a claim or proceeding may be substantially different from the amount of the recognized liability 
in addition  because it is not permissible to recognize a liability until the loss is both probable and estimable  in some cases there may be insufficient time to recognize a liability prior to the actual incurrence of the loss upon verdict and judgment at trial  for example  or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement 
environmental liabilities remediation provisions at december  amounted to million and relate principally to our ellesmere port site 
the company records environmental liabilities when they are probable and costs can be estimated reasonably 
the company has to anticipate the program of work required and the associated future expected costs  and has to comply with environmental legislation in the relevant countries 
the company views the costs of vacating our ellesmere port site as a contingent liability because there is no present intention to exit the site 
the company has further determined that  due to the uncertain product life of tel  particularly in the market for aviation gasoline  there exists such uncertainty as to the timing of such cash flows that it is not possible to estimate them sufficiently reliably to recognize a provision 

table of contents goodwill the company tests goodwill annually for impairment  or between years if events occur or circumstances change which suggest that an impairment may have occurred 
the company elected to perform its annual tests in respect of fuel specialties and active chemicals goodwill as at december each year 
in reviewing for any impairment charge the fair value of the reporting units underlying the segments is estimated using an after tax cash flow methodology based on management s best available estimates at that time 
the key assumptions underpinning these calculations include future revenue growth  gross margins and the company s weighted average cost of capital 
at december  we had million and million of goodwill relating to our fuel specialties and active chemicals businesses  respectively 
at this date we performed annual impairment tests and concluded that there has been no impairment of goodwill in respect of those reporting segments 
in light of the continuing decline in the octane additives market globally  as the company makes sales of octane additives in each quarter  the remaining sales and corresponding cash flows that can be derived from the octane additives business are reduced  and accordingly the fair value of the octane additives reporting unit is reduced 
as a result  the company determined that quarterly impairment tests be performed from january  and any impairment charge arising be recognized in the relevant quarter 
as a result of the octane additives impairment tests performed during  and impairment charges of million  million and million  respectively  have been recognized 
these charges are non cash in nature and have no impact on taxation 
there is million of goodwill remaining at december  which relates to the octane additives business 
given the quantum and predictability of the remaining future cash flows from the octane additives business the company expects goodwill impairment charges to be recognized in the income statement on an approximate straight line basis to december  we believe that the assumptions used in our annual and quarterly impairment tests are reasonable  but that they are judgmental  and that variations in any of the assumptions may result in materially different calculations of impairment charges  if any 
intangible assets  net of amortization at december  we had million of intangibles that are discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
these intangible assets relate to all of our business segments and are being amortized straight line over periods of up to years 
we continually assess the markets and products related to these intangibles  as well as their specific carrying values  and have concluded that these carrying values and amortization periods remain appropriate 
we also evaluate these intangibles for any potential impairment when events occur or circumstances change which suggest that an impairment may have occurred 
if events occur or circumstances change it may possibly cause a reduction in periods over which these intangibles are amortized or result in a non cash impairment of a portion of the intangibles carrying value 
a reduction in amortization periods would have no effect on cash flows 

table of contents pensions the company maintains a contributory defined benefit pension plan the plan covering a number of its current and former employees in the united kingdom  although it does also have other much smaller pension arrangements in the us and overseas 
the plan is closed to future service accrual but has a large number of deferred and current pensioners 
a full triennial actuarial valuation of the plan was performed as at december  and an update performed as at december   the results of which are reflected in these consolidated financial statements 
at december  the underlying plan asset value and projected benefit obligation pbo were million and million  respectively  resulting in a deficit of million 
movements in the underlying plan asset value and pbo are dependent on actual return on investments as well as our assumptions in respect of the discount rate  annual member mortality rates  future return on assets  future pension increases and future inflation 
a change in any one of these assumptions could impact the plan asset value  pbo and pension cost recognized in the income statement 
such changes could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 
a change in either the discount rate assumption  or level of price inflation assumption  would change the pbo by approximately million and the net pension charge for by approximately million 
further disclosure is provided in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance and uncertain income tax positions at december   we had a valuation allowance aggregating million against part of our foreign tax credit carry forwards within deferred tax 
the valuation allowance requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
objective evidence  such as operating results during the most recent periods  is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability  which are inherently uncertain 
in our view  there are uncertainties around whether all the foreign tax credits carry forwards can be utilized in future periods and this represents sufficient negative evidence to require a partial valuation allowance 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves evaluating uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be required 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we also recognize tax benefits to the extent that it is more likely than not that our positions will be sustained when challenged by the taxing authorities 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities  our effective tax rate in a given period may be materially affected 
an 
table of contents unfavorable tax settlement may require cash payments and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
we report interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income taxes 
for additional information regarding uncertain income tax positions see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

other income statement captions pension charge this non cash charge increased by million to million despite a decrease in the underlying current service cost 
this increased charge primarily reflects a lower expected future return on plan assets 
corporate costs fell by million due to a million gain on stock options forfeited upon resignation of the company s former ceo and a million prior years united kingdom sales tax settlement in  and million of advisory and financing costs expensed in in relation to two large potential acquisitions that the company decided not to pursue 
the remaining reductions relate to the favorable impact of exchange rates on the predominantly british pound sterling cost base in tandem with tight cost controls

the reduction is the result of an extension to the estimated future life of our octane additives business and the million reduction in intangible assets recognized in for contract related provisions no longer deemed necessary 
impairment of octane additives business goodwill the charge was lower than that recognized in primarily due to the higher operating income and associated cash flows in

income taxes in we assumed that none of the offp and fcpa settlement accrual would be tax deductible 
in addition  income taxes were also impacted by the adjustment of income tax provisions as a result of the settlement of certain united kingdom tax positions 
accordingly we believe that the change in the effective rate of tax to in from in is best explained by adjusting for these 
this adjusted effective tax rate has decreased by percentage points between the comparative periods primarily due to the positive impact of taxable profits in different geographical locations

the million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily reflects the million reclassification into long term accrued liabilities following the settlement of the offp and fcpa investigations  and payments made to the government authorities in aggregating to million 
the million decrease in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses was due to the timing of shipments in our octane additives business offset by the increased fourth quarter trading in our fuel specialties and active chemicals businesses 
the million increase in inventories was focused in our active chemicals and fuel specialties businesses as we balanced production levels in octane additives to meet fluctuations in demand 
cash at december  and we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
short term investments at december  and we had short term investments of million and nil  respectively 
debt on february   we entered into a three year finance facility which provides for borrowings by us of up to million including a term loan of million and revolving credit facility of million 
the revolving credit facility can be drawn down until the finance facility expires on february  
table of contents the company s finance facility contains restrictive clauses which may constrain our activities and limit our operational and financial flexibility 
the facility obliges the lenders to comply with a request for utilization of finance unless there is an event of default outstanding 
events of default are defined in the finance facility and include a material adverse change to our business  properties  assets  financial condition or results of operations 
the facility contains a number of restrictions that limit our ability  amongst other things  and subject to certain limited exceptions  to incur additional indebtedness  pledge our assets as security  guarantee obligations of third parties  make investments  undergo a merger or consolidation  dispose of assets  or materially change our line of business 
in addition  the facility also contains terms which  if breached  would result in the loan becoming repayable on demand 
it requires  among other matters  compliance with two financial covenant ratios measured on a quarterly basis 
these requirements are the ratio of net debt to ebitda shall not be greater than and the ratio of ebitda to net interest shall not be less than ebitda is a non gaap measure of liquidity defined in the finance facility 
management believes that the company has not breached these covenants throughout the period to december  and expects to not breach these covenants for the next months 
the finance facility is secured by a number of fixed and floating charges over certain assets of the company and its subsidiaries 
as at december   the company had million of debt outstanding under its finance facility and was in compliance with all financial covenants therein 
the debt maturity profile as at december   including the finance facility  is set out below in millions current portion of long term debt long term debt  net of current portion outlook at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million and debt of million resulting in net cash of million 
we expect net cash to remain stable in future quarters despite the need to build working capital from recent low levels  accelerate our spending on research and development  increase our capital expenditures and continue making cash payments following settlement of the offp and fcpa investigations 
accordingly  our focus continues to be on both generating and preserving cash 
the company expects to fund its operations over at least the next months from a combination of operating cash flows and its existing finance facility 
under the finance facility 
table of contents we have the ability to draw down the million revolving credit facility  of which million was drawn down at december   so long as we are in compliance with all financial covenants therein 
pension plans and other post employment benefits the company recognizes the funded status of defined benefit post retirement plans on the consolidated balance sheets  and changes in the funded status in comprehensive income 
the measurement date of the plan s funded status is the same as the company s fiscal year end 
contractual commitments the following represents contractual commitments at december  and the effect of those obligations on future cash flows in millions total thereafter operating activities planned funding of pension obligations remediation payments severance payments operating lease commitments raw material purchase obligations interest payments on debt financing activities long term debt obligations investing activities capital commitments total operating activities the amounts related to the pension plan refer to the likely levels of company funding of the united kingdom contributory defined benefit pension plan the plan 
the plan is closed to future service accrual but has a large number of deferred and current pensioners 
the company expects its annual cash contribution to be million in and million in it is not meaningful to predict an amount after five years since there are numerous uncertainties including future return on assets  pension increases  inflation and employment levels 
remediation payments represent those cash flows that the company is currently obligated to pay in respect of current and former facilities 
it does not include any discretionary remediation costs that the company may choose to incur 

table of contents severance payments represent those cash flows that the company is currently obligated to pay in respect of severance costs associated with exit or disposal activities and post employment benefits 
operating lease commitments relate primarily to office space  motor vehicles and various items of computer and office equipment which are expected to be renewed and replaced in the normal course of business 
raw material purchase obligations relate to certain long term raw material contracts which have been entered into by the company that stipulate fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum  or variable cost provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
the company uses interest rate swaps to hedge against the risk from variable interest rates on certain elements of its long term debt 
the estimated payments included in the table above reflect the variable interest charge on long term debt obligations and the effect of the interest rate swaps 
estimated commitment fees are also included and interest income is excluded 
due to the uncertainty regarding the nature of tax audits  particularly those which are not currently underway  it is not meaningful to predict the outcome of obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits 
further disclosure is provided in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
financing activities on february  we entered into a three year finance facility which provides for borrowings by us of up to million including a term loan of million and revolving credit facility of million 
the revolving credit facility can be drawn down until the finance facility expires on february  the term loan repayments are as follows million was paid on february   million was paid on february   and million is due on february  at december  long term debt comprised a million term loan and million drawn under the revolving credit facility 
investing activities capital commitments relate to certain capital projects that the company has committed to undertake 
environmental matters and plant closures the company is subject to environmental laws in all of the countries in which it operates 
under certain environmental laws the company is responsible for the remediation of hazardous substances or wastes at currently or formerly owned or operated properties 
most of our manufacturing operations have been conducted outside the us and  therefore  any liability pertaining to the investigation and remediation of contaminated properties is likely to be determined under non us law 

table of contents we evaluate costs for remediation  decontamination and demolition projects on a regular basis 
full provision is made for those costs to which we are committed under environmental laws 
full provision has been made for the committed costs of million at december  expenditure against provisions was million  million and million in the years  and  respectively 
we have also incurred personnel severance costs in relation to the management of the decline in the octane additives market and the restructuring of the fuel specialties and active chemicals businesses 
total severance expenditure was million  million and million in the years  and  respectively 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company operates manufacturing and blending facilities  offices and laboratories around the world 
the company sells a range of fuel specialties  active chemicals and octane additives to customers around the world 
the company uses floating rate debt to finance these global operations 
consequently  the company is subject to business risks inherent in non us activities  including political and economic uncertainty  import and export limitations  and market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the political and economic risks are mitigated by the stability of the countries in which the company s largest operations are located 
credit limits  ongoing credit evaluation and account monitoring procedures are used to minimize bad debt risk 
collateral is not generally required 
the company uses derivatives  including interest rate swaps  commodity swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts  in the normal course of business to manage market risks 
the derivatives used in hedging activities are considered risk management tools and are not used for trading purposes 
in addition  the company enters into derivative instruments with a diversified group of major financial institutions in order to monitor the exposure to non performance of such instruments 
the company s objective in managing exposure to changes in interest rates is to limit the impact of such changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
the company s objective in managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is to reduce volatility on earnings and cash flows associated with such changes 
the company offers fixed prices for some long term sales contracts 
as manufacturing and raw material costs are subject to variability the company uses commodity swaps to hedge the cost of some raw materials thus reducing volatility on earnings and cash flows 
the derivatives are considered risk management tools and are not used for trading purposes 
the company s objective is to manage its exposure to fluctuating costs of raw materials 
interest rate risk the company uses interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure 
as at december  the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  no bank overdraft and long term debt of million 
the long term debt comprises million senior term loan and million drawn under the revolving credit facility 
in the company entered into interest rate swap agreements  to convert floating rate debt to fixed rate  that cover million of the million remaining long term debt including current portion as at december  on the basis that million of the million long term debt including current portion is hedged against interest movements and that the company would receive interest on the million positive cash balances and short term investments  then the interest payable on unhedged debt of million is more than offset by the interest receivable on positive cash balances and short term investments 
on a gross basis  assuming no additional interest on the cash balances and short term investments  
table of contents a hypothetical absolute change of in us base interest rates on the unhedged debt of million for a one year period would impact net income and cash flows by approximately million before tax 
on a net basis  assuming additional interest on the cash balances and short term investments  a hypothetical absolute change of in us base interest rates for a one year period would impact net income and cash flows by approximately million before tax 
the above does not consider the effect of interest or exchange rate changes on overall activity nor management action to mitigate such changes 
exchange rate risk the company generates an element of its revenues and incurs some operating costs in currencies other than the us dollar 
the reporting currency of the company is the us dollar 
the company evaluates the functional currency of each reporting unit according to the economic environment in which it operates 
several major subsidiaries of the company operating outside of the us have the us dollar as their functional currency due to the nature of the markets in which they operate 
in addition  the financial position and results of operations of some of our foreign subsidiaries are reported in the relevant local currency and then translated to us dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
the primary foreign currencies in which we have exchange rate fluctuation exposure are the european union euro and british pound sterling 
changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets and liabilities  to the extent that such figures reflect the inclusion of foreign assets and liabilities which are translated into us dollars for presentation in our consolidated financial statements  as well as our results of operations 
the company s objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency rate changes 
accordingly  the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change to protect the us dollar value of its existing foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  commitments  and cash flows 
the company also uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset a portion of the company s exposure to certain foreign currency denominated revenues so that gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the us dollar value of the related foreign currency denominated revenues 
the objective of the hedging program is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the trading of our three business segments is inherently naturally hedged and accordingly changes in exchange rates would not be material to our earnings or financial position 
corporate costs  however  are largely denominated in british pound sterling 
a 
table of contents strengthening in the us dollar against british pound sterling would increase reported operating income by approximately million for a one year period excluding the impact of any foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
where a strengthening of the us dollar has been used as an illustration  a weakening would be expected to have the opposite effect on operating income 
raw material cost risk we use a variety of raw materials  chemicals and energy in our manufacturing and blending processes 
many of the raw materials that we use are derived from petrochemical based feedstocks which can be subject to periods of rapid and significant cost instability 
these fluctuations in cost can be caused by political instability in oil producing nations and elsewhere  or other factors influencing global supply and demand of these materials  over which we have no or little control 
we use long term contracts generally with fixed costs or formula based costs to help ensure availability and continuity of supply  and to manage the risk of cost increases 
we have entered into hedging arrangements for certain raw materials  but do not typically enter into hedging arrangements for all raw materials  chemicals or energy costs 
should the costs of raw materials  chemicals or energy increase  and should we not be able to pass on these cost increases to our customers  then operating margins and cash flows from operating activities would be adversely impacted 
should raw material costs increase significantly  then the company s need for working capital could similarly increase 
any of these risks could adversely impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows
