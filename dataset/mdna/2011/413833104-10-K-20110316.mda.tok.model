background and overview we incorporated under the laws of the state of new york in august in  we completed an ipo 
in  we divested all of our assets except otisville biotech  inc  and became a financial services company with the investment in otisville as the initial focus of our business activity 
in  we registered as an investment company under the act  commencing operations as a closed end  non diversified investment company 
in  we elected to become a bdc subject to the provisions of sections through of the act 
we are a venture capital company that specializes in making investments in companies commercializing and integrating products enabled by nanotechnology and microsystems 
we define venture capital investments as the money and resources made available to privately held start up firms and privately held and publicly traded small businesses with exceptional growth potential 
nanotechnology is the study of structures measured in nanometers  which are units of measurement in billionths of a meter 
microsystems are measured in micrometers  which are units of measurement in millionths of a meter 
we sometimes use tiny technology to describe both of these disciplines 
we consider a company to fit our investment thesis if the company employs or intends to employ technology that we consider to be at the microscale or smaller and if the employment of that technology is material to its business plan 
by making these investments  we seek to provide our shareholders with a specific focus on nanotechnology and microsystems through a portfolio of venture capital investments that address a variety of markets and products 
as of december    or percent  of our total assets at fair value consisted of private venture capital investments in equity or equity related securities  including unrealized appreciation of  as of december    or percent  of our total assets at fair value consisted of private venture capital investments in non convertible debt securities  net of unrealized depreciation of  as of december   of our total assets consisted of publicly traded venture capital investments 
as of december    or percent  of our total assets at fair value consisted of private venture capital investments  net of unrealized depreciation of  as of december   of our total assets consisted of non convertible debt securities 
as of december    or less than one percent  of our total assets at market value consisted of publicly traded venture capital investments  net of unrealized depreciation of  we believe that we are the only publicly traded bdc making venture capital investments exclusively in nanotechnology and microsystems 
we believe we provide five core benefits to our shareholders 
first  we are an established firm with a track record of investing in venture capital backed companies 
second  we provide shareholders with access to emerging companies that commercialize and integrate products enabled by nanotechnology and microsystems that are privately and publicly owned 
third  we have an existing portfolio of companies that we believe are comparable in stage to those found in the latter years of a private venture capital fund 
fourth  we are able to invest opportunistically in a range of types of securities to take advantage of market inefficiencies 
many venture capital firms structured as private partnerships are restricted to certain types of assets 
we believe our recent efforts to invest in venture debt securities fit this description 
fifth  we provide access to venture capital investments in a vehicle that  unlike private venture capital firms  is both transparent and liquid 
investment strategy we have discretion in the investment of our capital 
throughout our corporate history  we have made primarily early stage venture capital investments in a variety of industries 
these businesses can range in stage from pre revenue to generating positive cash flow 
these businesses tend to be thinly capitalized  unproven  small companies that lack management depth  have little or no history of operations and are developing unproven technologies 
these businesses may be privately held or publicly traded 
we historically have invested in equity securities of these companies that are generally illiquid due to restrictions on resale and to the lack of an established trading market 
our investments in equity and convertible debt securities are made using our cash reserves  currently invested in us treasury obligations 
we do not use leverage or debt to supplement our cash in investments in equity and convertible debt securities 
we refer to our portfolio of investments in equity and equity related securities in later sections of the management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as our equity focused portfolio of investments 
additionally  we provide non convertible debt financing to privately held or publicly traded companies that are generating cash or have near term visibility to reaching positive cash flow 
credit remains extremely expensive or unavailable for even the strongest small privately held and publicly traded companies 
in addition to fees and monthly principal and interest payments  we may receive warrants in these investments 
providing non convertible debt enables us to generate near term cash flow with a defined period for return on our investment 
we may use leverage or debt to help fund our investments in non convertible debt securities as these investments have defined periods of time for return on investment 
we refer to our portfolio of investments in non convertible debt in later sections of the management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as our venture debt portfolio of investments 
historical investments since our investment in otisville in through december   we have made a total of venture capital investments 
we have exited of these investments  realizing total gross proceeds of  on our cumulative invested capital of  in  we invested in our first nanotechnology company  nanophase technologies corporation 
recognizing the potential of nanotechnology  we continued to monitor developments in the field 
from august through december   all of our initial investments have been in companies commercializing or integrating products enabled by nanotechnology or microsystems 
from august through december   we have invested a total before any subsequent write ups  write downs or dispositions of  in these companies 
we currently have companies in our portfolio  including one investment made prior to at december   from first dollar in  the average and median holding periods for these investments were years and years  respectively 
historically  as measured from first dollar in to last dollar out  the average and median holding periods for the investments we have exited were years and years  respectively 
in the first quarter of  we had liquidity events in two of our portfolio companies 
biovex group  inc  was purchased by amgen  inc  on march   after approximately years in our portfolio 
neophotonics corporation completed an ipo on february   after approximately years in our portfolio 
investment pace we invested  in nanotechnology and microsystems in we invested  in nanotechnology and microsystems in the following is a summary of our annual initial and follow on investments in nanotechnology from january   to december  we consider a round led to be a round where we were the sole institutional investor or the leader of a set of investors in an investee company 
typically  but not always  the lead investor negotiates the price and terms of a deal with the investee company 
total incremental investments investments in our equity focused portfolio of investments in privately held and publicly traded companies no 
of new investments no 
of follow on investment rounds no 
of rounds led average dollar amount initial average dollar amount follow on investments in our venture debt portfolio of investments in privately held and publicly traded companies no 
of new investments average dollar amount at december   we had no equity investments in publicly traded companies 
importance of availability of liquid capital private venture capital funds are structured commonly as limited partnerships with a committed level of capital and finite lifetime 
capital is called from limited partners to make investments and pay for expenses of running the firm at various points within the lifetime of the fund 
for each initial investment  the fund must reserve additional capital for follow on investments at later stages of the life of the portfolio companies 
these follow on investments are required because often venture backed portfolio companies in areas in which we invest  whether privately held or publicly traded  operate with negative cash flow for lengthy periods of time 
in general  the cumulative total of initial invested capital and reserves cannot exceed the committed level of capital of the fund 
our strategy for investing capital is similar to this approach in some respects 
we make initial investments in privately held and publicly traded companies and project the amount of capital that may be required should the company mature successfully 
these projections  equivalent to the reserves of private venture capital funds  are reviewed weekly by management  are updated frequently and are a component of the data that guide our decisions on whether to make new and follow on investments 
as a publicly traded  internally managed venture capital company  our cash used to make investments and pay expenses is held by us and not called from external sources when needed 
accordingly  it is crucial that we operate the company with a substantial balance of liquid capital for this reason and for four additional reasons 
we manage the company and our investment criteria and pace such that our projected needs for capital to make new and follow on investments do not exceed the total of our liquid investments 
although we use best efforts to predict when this capital will be required for use in new and follow on investments  we cannot predict with certainty the timing for these investments 
we would be unable to make new or follow on investments in our portfolio companies without having substantial liquid resources of capital available to us 
venture capital firms traditionally invest beside other venture capital firms in a process called syndication 
the size of the fund and the amount of capital reserves available to syndicate partners is often an attribute that potential co investors consider when deciding on syndicate partners 
as we do not have committed capital from limited partners  we believe we must have adequate available liquid capital on our balance sheet to be able to have access to high quality deal flow 
we rarely commit the total amount of cumulative capital intended for investment in any portfolio company at one point in time 
instead  our investments consist of multiple rounds of financing of a given portfolio company  in which we typically participate if we believe that the merits of such an investment outweigh the risks 
we also commonly have preemptive rights to invest additional capital in our privately held portfolio companies 
these rights are useful to protect and potentially increase the value of our positions in our portfolio companies as they mature 
commonly  the terms of such financings in privately held companies also include penalties for those investors that do not invest in these subsequent rounds of financing 
without available capital at the time of investment  our ownership in the company would be subject to these penalties that can lead to a partial or complete loss of the capital invested prior to that round of financing 
we may have the opportunity to increase ownership in late rounds of financing in some of our most mature companies 
many private venture capital funds that invested in these companies are reaching the end of the term associated with their limited partnerships 
this issue may limit the available capital to these funds for follow on investments  and the ability to take advantage of potentially valuable terms given to those who have investable capital 
having permanent  liquid capital available for investment and access to the capital markets allows us to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise 
involvement with portfolio companies the act requires that bdcs offer to make available significant managerial assistance to portfolio companies 
we are actively involved with our portfolio companies through membership on boards of directors  as observers to the boards of directors and or through frequent communication with management 
as of december   we held at least a board seat or observer rights as part of our investments in of our portfolio companies percent 
we may hold two or more board seats in early stage portfolio companies or those in which we have significant ownership 
as of december   we held two board seats in ancora pharmaceuticals inc and enumeral biomedical corp 
we may transition off of the board of directors to an observer role as our portfolio companies raise additional capital from new investors  as they mature or as they are able to attract independent members who have relevant industry experience and contacts 
we also typically step off the board of directors upon the completion of an ipo 
we may be actively involved in the formation and development of business strategies of our earliest stage portfolio companies 
this involvement may include hiring management  licensing intellectual property  securing space and raising additional capital 
we also provide managerial assistance to late stage companies looking for potential exit opportunities by leveraging our status as a publicly traded company through our relationships with the banking community and our knowledge and experience implementing and complying with section of the sarbanes oxley act for larger companies 
commercialization of nanotechnology by our portfolio companies nanotechnology is a general purpose technology 
an innovation qualifies as a general purpose technology if it has the potential for pervasive use across a wide range of sectors in a way that fundamentally alters the modes of operations within those sectors 
nanotechnology is applicable to many industry clusters and can be used to address current and future market needs 
we have historically identified a number of existing and emerging market opportunities within industry clusters where we believe nanotechnology could yield disruptive capabilities and create value 
the two charts below identify these market opportunities and the pipeline of portfolio companies across industry clusters that seek to fulfill them  respectively 
we also include the percent of the value of our portfolio in each of the three industry clusters around which our portfolio has matured 

pgjpg 

pgjpg 
we refer to the three largest clusters of investment as nanotech for cleantechsm  nanotech for electronicssm and nanotech for healthcaresm  respectively 
these three clusters are comprised of multi billion dollar industries that have grown historically through innovation of technology 
we classify nanotech for cleantechsm companies as those that seek to improve performance  productivity or efficiency  and to reduce environmental impact  waste  cost  energy consumption or raw materials using nanotechnology enabled solutions 
cleantech is a term used commonly to describe products and processes that solve global problems related to resource constraints 
we classify nanotech for electronicssm companies as those that use nanotechnology to address problems in electronics related industries  including semiconductors 
we classify nanotech for healthcaresm companies as those that use nanotechnology to address problems in healthcare related industries  including biotechnology  pharmaceuticals and medical devices 
we have and may continue to make investments outside these industry areas  and we may not maintain these industry clusters or the weightings within these clusters in future quarters 
we believe the development and commercialization of nanotechnology enabled solutions are the result of the convergence of traditionally separate scientific disciplines such as biology  materials science  chemistry  electronics  information technology  and physics 
we believe such nanotechnology enabled advances in each of these industry clusters  and in general  could not otherwise occur within one discipline alone 
maturity of current equity focused venture capital portfolio our equity focused venture capital portfolio is composed of companies at varying maturities facing different types of risks 
we have defined these levels of maturity and sources of risk as early stage technology risk  mid stage market risk and late stage execution risk 
early stage companies have a high degree of technical  market and execution risk  which is typical of initial investments by venture capital firms  including us 
these companies often require substantial development of their technologies before they begin introducing products to market 
mid stage companies are those that have overcome most of the technical risk associated with their products and are now focused on addressing the market acceptance for their products 
for those companies developing therapeutics or medical devices  the focus is on bringing their products through the first phases of clinical trials 
late stage companies are those that have determined there is a market for their products  and they are now focused on sales execution and scale 
late stage healthcare and biotechnology companies are typically either in phase iii clinical trials  which are the pivotal trials before a possible fda approval and commercial launch of a product  or are generating revenue from the commercial sale of one or more products 
the charts below show our assessment of the stage of maturity of the companies in our equity focused portfolio of investments and the distribution of ownership of our portfolio companies within each of these stages of maturity  respectively 

pgjpg 

pgjpg 
we seek to create a portfolio of companies that enables consistent flows of potential exit events in multiple industry sectors that can be monetized as these companies mature 
we believe a portfolio of companies focused on a diverse set of industry clusters reduces the potential impact of cyclicality of any one cluster on the flow of potential exit events 
our current portfolio is comprised of companies at varying stages of maturity in a diverse set of industry clusters 
as our portfolio companies mature  we seek to invest in new early and mid stage companies that may mature into mid and late stage companies 
this continuous progression creates a pipeline of investment maturities that may lead to more frequent exit events of our portfolio companies 
this pipeline is demonstrated by the distribution of our current portfolio companies by stage within each industry cluster 

pgjpg 
we expect some of our portfolio companies to transition between stages of maturity over time 
this transition may be forward if the company is maturing and is successfully executing its business plan or may be backward if the company is not successfully executing its business plan or decides to change its business plan substantially from its original plan 
transitions backward are commonly accompanied by an increase in non performance risk  which reduces valuation 
we discuss non performance risk and its implications on value below in the section titled valuation of investments 
during the fourth quarter of  we transitioned two companies  sionyx  inc  and d wave systems  inc  from being classified as early stage companies to mid stage companies  and we transitioned innovalight  inc  from a mid stage company to a late stage company 
we classified our new portfolio company  ultora  inc  as an early stage company as of december  we currently have companies in our equity focused venture capital portfolio that generate revenues ranging from nominal to significant from commercial sales of products and or services  from commercial partnerships and or from government grants 
in aggregate  our portfolio companies had approximately million in revenue in  a percent increase from aggregate revenue of approximately million 
on january   amgen  inc  agreed to acquire biovex group  inc  for an upfront payment of million and milestone payments of million 
this transaction closed on march  on march   the company received its upfront payment of  which did not include  held in escrow 
if all the milestone payments were to be paid by amgen  we would receive  there can be no assurances as to how much of this amount we will ultimately realize 
on december   the value of our investment in biovex was  which included the upfront payment and certain discounts applied to future escrow and milestone payments biovex may be eligible to receive 
as of december   our cost basis in biovex was on february   neophotonics corporation completed an ipo by selling  shares of common stock at per share 
harris harris group purchased  shares in this transaction 
the common stock of neophotonics trades on the new york stock exchange under the symbol nptn 
as of december   harris harris group owned an aggregate of  shares of neophotonics  which converted to common stock on a one for one basis as of the ipo 
this position was valued at  as of december  the key inputs to our valuation of neophotonics were the share price as of the close of the first day of trading following the company ipo and a liquidity discount owing to the day lock up period 
as of march   neophotonics closing price was per share 
during the second half of  three of our privately held companies retained bankers to explore opportunities to sell those companies 
two of these three companies have received offers for acqusition through non bindin letters of intent 
there can be no assurance that these companies will successfully complete a sale 
a variety of factors  including general business conditions  could lead one or more of these companies to terminate such efforts or could lead to one or more of the potential acquirers to rescind their non binding offers to purchase those companies 
on march   solazyme  inc  filed a registration statement on form s to register its shares of common stock for an ipo 
there can be no assurance that this company will successfully complete an ipo  and a variety of factors  including stock market and general business conditions  could lead it to terminate such efforts to complete an ipo 
current business environment the fourth quarter of concluded with the public markets continuing to increase broadly in value 
amidst this improvement in the value of public equities  there were sustained positive signs in the exit market for venture backed companies with venture backed companies managing to complete ipos  up from three ipos in the same quarter of however  even within this improving general economic environment  the availability of capital for venture capital firms and venture backed companies continues to be restricted 
investors in venture capital funds are becoming more selective not only with the venture capital funds they invest in  but also with the amount of capital they invest in these funds 
in  the us venture capital industry only managed to raise a total of billion across funds  the lowest level in seven years  according to dow jones lp source 
although fundraising for late stage funds increased throughout  both fundraising for early stage and multi stage funds continued to slide in early stage funds raised by firms accounted for billion  a percent decrease from this trend is in part owing to the closely watched year benchmark for venture capital returns that stood at minus percent as of september   which is the most recent data available for this statistic from cambridge associates  llc 
historically  difficult venture environments have resulted in a higher than normal number of companies not receiving financing and being subsequently closed down with a loss to venture investors  and other companies receiving financing but at significantly lower valuations than the preceding financing rounds 
this issue is compounded by the fact that many existing venture capital firms have few remaining years of investment and available capital owing to the finite lifetime of the funds managed by these firms 
additionally  even if a firm was able to raise a new fund  commonly new funds are not permitted to invest new funds in existing investments 
this limitation of available capital can lead to fractured syndicates of investors 
a fractured syndicate can result in a portfolio company being unable to raise additional capital to fund operations 
this issue is especially acute in capital intensive industries that are enabled by nanotechnology  such as healthcare  semiconductors and electronics  and cleantech 
the portfolio company may be forced to sell before reaching its full potential or be shut down entirely if the remaining investors cannot financially support the company 
as such  the currently improving exit environment for venture backed companies through ipos and m a transactions and the currently improving public markets in general may not translate to an increase in the available capital to venture backed companies  particularly those that have investments from funds that are in the latter stage of life unless the markets continue to improve for some time into the future 
our overall goal remains unchanged  which is to maintain our leadership position in investing in nanotechnology and microsystems and to increase our net asset value 
the current environment for venture capital financings continues to favor those firms that have capital to invest regardless of the stage of the investee company 
we continue to finance our new and follow on equity and convertible debt investments from our cash reserves  currently invested in us treasury obligations 
we believe the turmoil of the venture capital industry and the current economic climate provide opportunities to invest this capital at historically low valuations in equity and convertible debt securities and at high yields in non convertible debt securities of new and existing privately held and publicly traded companies of varying maturities 
valuation of investments we value our privately held venture capital investments each quarter as determined in good faith by our valuation committee  a committee of all the independent directors  within guidelines established by our board of directors in accordance with the act 
see footnote to consolidated schedule of investments contained in consolidated financial statements 
the values of privately held  venture capital backed companies are inherently more difficult than publicly traded companies to assess at any single point in time because securities of these types of companies are not actively traded 
we believe  perhaps even more than in the past  that illiquidity  and the perception of illiquidity  can affect value 
management believes further that the long term effects of the difficult venture capital market and difficult  but improving  exit environments will continue to affect negatively the fundraising ability of weak companies regardless of near term improvements in the overall global economy and public markets  and that these factors can also affect value 
in each of the years in the period through  the company recorded the following gross write ups in privately held securities as a percentage of net assets at the beginning of the year boy  gross write downs in privately held securities as a percentage of net assets at the beginning of the year  and change in value of private portfolio securities as a percentage of net assets at the beginning of the year 
net asset value  boy gross write downs during year gross write ups during year gross write downs as a percentage of net asset value  boy gross write ups as a percentage of net asset value  boy net change as a percentage of net asset value  boy from december   to december   the value of our private venture capital portfolio increased by  from  to  approximately million of this amount was from new and follow on investments in our privately held portfolio companies 
the remaining million was from a net increase in the value of our portfolio companies 
the table below indicates some of the inputs used to determine value of our privately held portfolio companies and the portion of the change in value  on a quarter over quarter basis  relevant to those inputs 
we note that our valuation committee and ultimately our board of directors take into account multiple sources of quantitative and qualitative inputs to determine the value of our privately held portfolio companies 
q to q q to q q to q q to q value of privately held portfolio as of previous quarter value of privately held portfolio as of current quarter examples of inputs that contribute to changes in value total new and follow on investments due to terms of new equity rounds of financing due to terms of new equity rounds of financing due to in values of comparables or indications of value from potential acquirers due to in values of comparables or indications of value from potential acquirers due to in non performance risk due to in non performance risk other factors total change in value of privately held portfolio from quarter to quarter other factors include changes in accrued bridge note interest  currency fluctuations and the value of warrants 
the values of publicly traded comparables on december   and indications of value from potential or confirmed acquirers were significant factors in determining the values of five of our privately held portfolio companies 
one of these five companies is biovex group  inc the key input to the valuation of our investment in biovex group  inc  at december   was the terms of the definitive acquisition agreement between biovex and amgen that closed on march  the key inputs to the valuation of our investment in neophotonics corporation were the share price as of the close of the first day of trading following the company s ipo and a liquidity discount owing to the day lock up period 
as of march   the closing price of neophotonics common stock was per share 
neophotonics and the three other companies out of the five in this classification accounted for approximately million of the total value of our venture capital portfolio as of december  these values could differ materially if calculated on a different date due to changes in values and or operating performance of the publicly traded comparables or should potential acquisitions of a subset of these companies not be consummated 
as part of the valuation process  we consider non performance risk 
non performance risk is the risk that a portfolio company will be a unable to raise capital  will need to be shut down and will not return our invested capital  or b able to raise capital  but at a valuation significantly lower than the implied post money valuation 
our best estimate of the non performance risk of our portfolio companies has been quantified and included in the valuation of the companies as of december  in the future  as these companies receive terms for additional financings or are unable to receive additional financing and  therefore  proceed with sales or shutdowns of the business  we expect the contribution of the discount for non performance risk to vary in importance in determining the values of our securities of these companies 
as of december   non performance risk was a significant factor in determining the values of of our privately held portfolio companies 
these companies accounted for approximately million of the total value of our privately held venture capital portfolio 
we increased the non performance risk  thereby decreasing the value  of four companies 
we decreased the non performance risk  thereby increasing the value  of zero companies 
we maintained the same level of non performance risk in eight companies 
as of december   our top ten investments by value accounted for approximately percent of the value of our venture capital portfolio 
as of that date  we believe at least four of these ten companies will require capital by the end of top ten investments by value company name value as of december  cumulative of venture capital portfolio solazyme  inc  biovex group  inc  xradia  inc  sionyx  inc  bridgelux  inc  adestotechnologies corporation  d wave systems  inc  neophotonics  inc  laser light engines  inc  contour energy systems  inc  percent of value of venture capital portfolio the increase or decrease in the value of our venture capital investments does not affect the day to day operations of the company  as we had no debt as of december  we fund our venture capital investments and daily operating expenses from interest earned and proceeds from the sales of our investments in us government and agency obligations 
as of december   we held  in us government obligations  and we had an additional  in cash 
investment objective our principal objective is to achieve long term capital appreciation by making equity focused venture capital investments 
therefore  a significant portion of our current venture capital investment portfolio provides little or no income in the form of dividends or interest 
current income is a secondary objective 
we are implementing a strategy that we believe will provide greater regularity and shorter time periods between realizations of capital gains on investments 
as part of this strategy  we are seeking to increase our current income by providing debt financing to privately held and publicly traded small companies 
we seek to reach the point where future growth is financed through reinvestment of our capital gains from our venture capital investments and where current income offsets our annual expenses during periods of time between realizations of capital gains on our investments 
we currently earn interest income from fixed income securities  including us government and agency securities 
the amount of interest income we earn varies with the average balance of our fixed income portfolio and the average yield on this portfolio 
in previous years  we have been able to generate substantial amounts of interest income from our holdings of us treasury securities 
as of december   we held one short duration us treasury security yielding approximately percent 
as of december   yields for month  month  and month us treasury securities were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
with yields at this level  we expect to generate less interest income from us government securities than in previous fiscal quarters and years 
results of operations we present the financial results of our operations utilizing accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap for investment companies 
on this basis  the principal measure of our financial performance during any period is the net increase decrease in our net assets resulting from our operating activities  which is the sum of the following three elements net operating income loss the difference between our income from interest  dividends  and fees and our operating expenses 
net realized gain loss on investments the difference between the net proceeds of sales of portfolio securities and their stated cost  plus income from interests in limited liability companies 
net increase decrease in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments the net unrealized change in the value of our investment portfolio 
owing to the structure and objectives of our business  we generally expect to experience net operating losses and seek to generate increases in our net assets from operations through the long term appreciation of our venture capital investments 
we have relied  and continue to rely  primarily on proceeds from sales of investments  rather than on investment income  to defray a significant portion of our operating expenses 
because such sales are unpredictable  we attempt to maintain adequate working capital to provide for fiscal periods when there are no such sales 
during  we made our first venture debt investment 
while the interest income generated from this investment did not defray a significant portion of our operating expenses in  further investments in venture debt could generate more substantial investment income in future years 
the potential for  or occurrence of  inflation could result in rising interest rates for government backed debt 
this trend would have two effects on our business 
first  the spread between the interest rates we can obtain from investing low risk government debt versus high risk venture debt will compress  which would result in a reduction of the risk premium associated with investments in venture debt 
we may reduce the number and amount invested in venture debt should this risk premium decrease substantially as to not compensate us adequately for the risk associated with such investments 
second  funds drawn from our line of credit will accrue interest at a rate that fluctuates with the london interbank offered rate libor 
libor is expected to increase in times of inflation 
our venture debt investments may include both fixed and floating interest rates 
our interest income would decrease if the spread between the interest rate on funds from our line of credit and our venture debt investments decrease 
years ended december    and during the year ended december   we had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of  during the years ended december   and  we had net decreases in net assets resulting from operations of  and  respectively 
investment income and expenses during the years ended december    and  we had net operating losses of   and  respectively 
the variation in these results is primarily owing to the changes in investment income and operating expenses  including non cash expense of  in   in  and  in associated with the granting of stock options 
during the years ended december    and  total investment income was   and  respectively 
during the years ended december    and  total operating expenses were   and  respectively 
during  as compared with  investment income increased from  to  reflecting an increase in interest income from bridge notes and the participation agreement  offset by a decrease in our average holdings of us government securities as well as a substantial decrease in interest rates 
the average yield on our us government securities decreased from percent for the year ended december   to percent for the year ended december  during the twelve months ended december   our average holdings of such securities were  as compared with  during the year ended december  operating expenses  including non cash  stock based compensation expenses  were  and  for the twelve months ended december   and december   respectively 
the decrease in operating expenses for the twelve months ended december   as compared with the twelve months ended december   was primarily owing to decreases in salaries  benefits and stock based compensation expense  administration and operations expense and professional fees  offset by an increase in rent expense  directors fees and expenses  and custody fees 
salaries  benefits and stock based compensation expense decreased by  or percent  through december   as compared with december   primarily as a result of a decrease in non cash expense of  associated with the harris harris group  inc equity incentive plan the stock plan 
while the non cash  stock based  compensation expense for the stock plan increased our operating expenses by  this increase was offset by a corresponding increase to our additional paid in capital  resulting in no net impact to our net asset value 
the non cash  stock based  compensation expense and corresponding increase to our additional paid in capital may increase in future quarters 
administration and operations expense decreased by  or percent  for the year ended december   as compared with the year ended december   primarily as a result of a decrease in our directors and officers liability insurance expense and decreases in the expenses related to the annual report and proxy  offset by increases in the cost of non employee related insurance and expenses associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters in new york city 
professional fees decreased by  or percent  for the year ended december   as compared with the year ended december   primarily as a result of a decrease in accounting and legal fees  offset by an increase in certain consulting fees 
rent expense increased  or percent  for the year ended december  our rent expense of  for the year ended december   includes  of rent paid in cash and  of non cash rent expense  credits and abatements that we recognize on a straight line basis over the lease term 
our cash based rent expense in was  our rent paid in cash of  includes  of real estate tax escalation charges from to paid on our previous corporate headquarters located at west street in new york city 
for the year ended december   we had a loss of  as a result of abandoning our lease at our former office prior to the end of the lease term  which expired in april directors fees and expenses increased by  or percent  for the year ended december   as compared with the year ended december   primarily as a result of increases in directors travel related expenses

the decrease in operating expenses for the twelve months ended december   as compared with the twelve months ended december   was primarily owing to decreases in salaries  benefits and stock based compensation expense and to decreases in administration and operations expense and directors fees and expenses  offset by increases in professional fees  rent expense and custody fees 
salaries  benefits and stock based compensation expense decreased by  or percent  through december   as compared with december   primarily as a result of a decrease in non cash expense of  associated with the stock plan and a decrease in salaries and benefits owing primarily to a decrease in our headcount  mainly the retirement of charles e

the non cash  stock based  compensation expense and corresponding increase to our additional paid in capital may increase in future quarters 
administration and operations expense decreased by  or percent  for the year ended december   as compared with the year ended december   primarily as a result of a decrease in our directors and officers liability insurance expense and decreases in the cost of non employee related insurance and managing directors travel related expenses

liquidity and capital resources our liquidity and capital resources are generated and are generally available through our cash holdings  interest earned on our investments on us government securities  cash flows from the sales of us government securities and payments received on our venture debt investments  proceeds from periodic follow on equity offerings and realized capital gains retained for reinvestment 
we fund our day to day operations using interest earned and proceeds from the sales of our investments in us government securities and interest earned from our venture debt securities 
the increase or decrease in the valuations of our portfolio companies does not impact our daily liquidity 
at december   and december   we had no investments in money market mutual funds 
we have not issued any debt securities  and  therefore  are not subject to credit agency downgrades 
as a venture capital company  it is critical that we have capital available to support our best companies until we have an opportunity for liquidity in our investments 
as such  we will continue to maintain a substantial amount of liquid capital on our balance sheet 
however  to complement our equity focused portfolio investing  we seek to invest some of this capital in venture debt where we will have more defined investment return timelines than we currently have in our existing portfolio 
in addition  in the future  we may from time to time opt to borrow money to make investments  specifically in debt securities that generate cash flow and have a known timeframe for return on investment 
on february   we established a new million three year revolving credit facility with td bank  na  to be used in conjunction with our venture debt investments 
we believe that the difficult venture capital environment may continue to adversely affect the valuation of investment portfolios  tighter lending standards and reduced access to capital 
these conditions may lead to a further decline in net asset value and or decline in valuations of our portfolio companies 
although we cannot predict future market conditions  we continue to believe that our current cash and us government security holdings and our ability to adjust our investment pace will provide us with adequate liquidity to execute our current business strategy 
except for a rights offering  we are also generally not able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below our net asset value per share  exclusive of any distributing commission or discount  without shareholder approval 
as of december   our net asset value was per share and our closing market price was per share 
we do not currently have shareholder approval to issue or sell shares below our net asset value per share

the decrease in our primary liquidity from december   to december   is primarily owing to the use of funds for investments and payment of net operating expenses 
at december   and december   our secondary liquidity was and  respectively 
our secondary liquidity consists of our publicly traded securities 
although these companies are publicly traded  their stock may not trade at high volumes and prices can be volatile  or our stock may be subject to restrictions on transfer  such as lock up provisions  which may restrict our ability to sell our positions at any given time 
on october   we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share to the public for total gross proceeds of  net proceeds of this offering  after placement agent fees and offering costs of  were  we intend to use  and have been using  the net proceeds of this offering to make new investments in nanotechnology  as well as for follow on investments in our existing venture capital investments and for working capital 
through december   we have used all of the net proceeds from this offering for these purposes 
on october   we filed a post effective amendment to our shelf registration statement on form n to deregister  shares of common stock that were not sold in the public offering that closed on october  on july   we signed a five year lease for office space at florence street  suite  palo alto  california  commencing on august   and expiring on august  total rent expense for our office space in palo alto was  in   in and  in future minimum lease payments in each of the following years are   and on september   we signed a ten year lease for office space at broadway  new york  new york

critical accounting policies the company significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and in the footnote to the consolidated schedule of investments 
critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and those that require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
the company considers the following accounting policies and related estimates to be critical valuation of portfolio investments the most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments recorded 
as a bdc  we invest in primarily illiquid securities that generally have no established trading market 
investments are stated at value as defined in the act and in the applicable regulations of the sec and gaap 
value  as defined in section a of the act  is i the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available and ii the fair value as determined in good faith by  or under the direction of  the board of directors for all other assets 
see valuation procedures in the footnote to consolidated schedule of investments 
as of december   our financial statements include privately held venture capital investments valued at  the fair values of which were determined in good faith by  or under the direction of  the board of directors 
as of december   approximately percent of our net assets represent investments in portfolio companies valued at fair value by the board of directors 
determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment  although our valuation policy is intended to provide a consistent basis for determining fair value of the portfolio investments 
factors that may be considered include  but are not limited to  the cost of the company s investment  transactions in the portfolio company s securities or unconditional firm offers by responsible parties  the financial condition and operating results of the company  the long term potential of the business and technology of the company  the values of similar securities issued by companies in similar businesses  multiples to revenues  net income or ebitda that similar securities issued by companies in similar businesses receive  the proportion of the company s securities we own and the nature of any rights to require the company to register restricted securities under the applicable securities laws  the achievement of milestones  and the rights and preferences of the class of securities we own as compared with other classes of securities the portfolio has issued 
in addition  with respect to our debt investments for which no readily available market quotations are available  we will generally consider the financial condition and current and expected future cash flows of the portfolio company  the creditworthiness of the portfolio company and its ability to meet its current debt obligations  the relative seniority of our debt investment within the portfolio company s capital structure  the availability and value of any available collateral  and changes in market interest rates and credit spreads for similar debt investments 
historically  difficult venture capital environments have resulted in companies not receiving financing and being subsequently closed down with a loss of investment to venture investors  and other companies receiving financing but at significantly lower valuations than the preceding rounds  leading to very deep dilution for those who do not participate in the new rounds of investment 
our best estimate of this non performance risk has been quantified and included in the valuation of our portfolio companies as of december  all investments recorded at fair value are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value 
hierarchical levels related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets  are as follows level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities  or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability 
level unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
as of december   all of our privately held portfolio investments were classified as level in the hierarchy  indicating a high level of judgment required in their valuation 
the values assigned to our assets are based on available information and do not necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized  as these amounts depend on future circumstances and cannot be reasonably determined until the individual investments are actually liquidated or become readily marketable 
upon sale of investments  the values that are ultimately realized may be different from what is presently estimated 
this difference could be material 
stock based compensation determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards on the date of grant requires judgment 
historically  we have used the black scholes merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options 
management uses the black scholes merton option pricing model in instances where we lack historical data necessary for more complex models and when the share award terms can be valued within the model 
other models may yield fair values that are significantly different from those calculated by the black scholes merton option pricing model 
management uses a binomial lattice option pricing model in instances where it is necessary to include a broader array of assumptions 
we used the binomial lattice model for the year nqsos granted on march  these awards included accelerated vesting provisions that were based on market conditions 
at the date of the grant  management s analysis concluded that triggering of the market condition acceleration clause was probable 
option pricing models require the use of subjective input assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  expected dividend rate  and expected risk free rate of return 
variations in the expected volatility or expected term assumptions have a significant impact on fair value 
as the volatility or expected term assumptions increase  the fair value of the stock option increases 
the expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return are not as significant to the calculation of fair value 
a higher assumed dividend rate yields a lower fair value  whereas higher assumed interest rates yield higher fair values for stock options 
in the black scholes merton model  we use the simplified calculation of expected term as described in the sec s staff accounting bulletin because of the lack of historical information about option exercise patterns 
in the binomial lattice model  we use an expected term that assumes the options will be exercised at two times the strike price because of the lack of option exercise patterns 
future exercise behavior could be materially different than that which is assumed by the model 
expected volatility is based on the historical fluctuations in the company stock 
the company stock has historically been volatile  which increases the fair value of the underlying share based awards 
gaap requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share based awards that will be forfeited owing to employee turnover 
quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported share based compensation  as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization after the grant date is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if the actual forfeiture rate proves to be higher than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment will be made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate  which would result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements 
if the actual forfeiture rate proves to be lower than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment will be made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate  which would result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements 
such adjustments would affect our operating expenses and additional paid in capital  but would have no effect on our net asset value 
pension and post retirement benefit plan assumptions the company provides a retiree medical benefit plan for employees who meet certain eligibility requirements 
the company also provides an executive mandatory retirement benefit plan for certain individuals employed by us in a bona fide executive or high policy making position 
several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability values related to our post retirement benefit plans 
these factors include assumptions we make about the discount rate  the rate of increase in healthcare costs  and mortality  among others 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the post retirement medical benefit and pension liabilities could be effectively settled considering the timing of expected payments for plan participants 
in estimating this rate  we consider the citigroup pension liability index in the determination of the appropriate discount rate assumptions 
the weighted average rate we utilized to measure our post retirement medical benefit obligation as of december   and to calculate our expense was percent 
we used a discount rate of percent to calculate our pension obligation for the executive mandatory retirement benefit plan

on march   the company made a  follow on investment in a privately held tiny technology portfolio company 
on march   solazyme  inc  filed a registration statement on form s to register its shares of common stock for an ipo 
there can be no assurance that this company will successfully complete an ipo  and a variety of factors  including stock market and general business conditions  could lead it to terminate such efforts to complete an ipo 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our business activities contain elements of risk 
we consider the principal types of market risk to be valuation risk  interest rate risk and foreign currency risk 
although we are risk seeking rather than risk averse in our investments  we consider the management of risk to be essential to our business 
valuation risk value  as defined in section a of the act  is i the market price for those securities for which market quotations are readily available and ii fair value as determined in good faith by  or under the direction of  the board of directors for all other assets 
see the valuation procedures in the footnote to consolidated schedule of investments contained in item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data 
because there is typically no public market for our interests in the small privately held companies in which we invest  the valuation of the equity interests in that portion of our portfolio is determined in good faith by our board of directors with the assistance of our valuation committee  comprised of the independent members of our board of directors  in accordance with our valuation procedures 
in the absence of a readily ascertainable market value  the determined value of our portfolio of equity interests may differ significantly from the values that would be placed on the portfolio if a ready market for the equity interests existed 
determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment  although our valuation policy is intended to provide a consistent basis for determining fair value of the portfolio investments 
factors that may be considered include  but are not limited to  readily available public market quotations  the cost of the company s investment  transactions in the portfolio company s securities or unconditional firm offers by responsible parties  the financial condition and operating results of the company  the long term potential of the business and technology of the company  the values of similar securities issued by companies in similar businesses  multiples to revenues  net income or ebitda that similar securities issued by companies in similar businesses receive  the proportion of the company s securities we own and the nature of any rights to require the company to register restricted securities under the applicable securities laws  the achievement of milestones  and the rights and preferences of the class of securities we own as compared with other classes of securities the portfolio has issued 
in addition  with respect to our debt investments for which no readily available market quotations are available  we will generally consider the financial condition and current and expected future cash flows of the portfolio company  the creditworthiness of the portfolio company and its ability to meet its current debt obligations  the relative seniority of our debt investment within the portfolio company s capital structure  the availability and value of any available collateral  and changes in market interest rates and credit spreads for similar debt investments 
any changes in valuation are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations as net decrease in unrealized depreciation on investments 
changes in valuation of any of our investments in privately held companies from one period to another may be volatile 
investments in privately held  immature companies are inherently more volatile than investments in more mature businesses 
such immature businesses are inherently fragile and easily affected by both internal and external forces 
our investee companies can lose much or all of their value suddenly in response to an internal or external adverse event 
conversely  these immature businesses can gain suddenly in value in response to an internal or external positive development 
the values assigned to our assets are based on available information and do not necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized  as these amounts depend on future circumstances and cannot be reasonably determined until the individual investments are actually liquidated or become readily marketable 
upon sale of investments  the values that are ultimately realized may be different from what is presently estimated 
this difference could be material 
interest rate risk interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates 
as of december   our one venture debt investment  geo semiconductor inc  was at a fixed rate 
as of december   we had no debt outstanding and funded our investment in geo semiconductor from cash on our balance sheet 
a change in interest rates would  therefore  not have a material effect on our net investment income 
in the future  some of our venture debt investments may be at variable rates 
because we intend to fund a portion of our venture debt investments with borrowings  our net investment income will be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income in future quarters 
we generally also invest in both short and long term us government and agency securities 
to the extent that we invest in short and long term us government and agency securities  changes in interest rates result in changes in the value of these obligations that result in an increase or decrease of our net asset value 
the level of interest rate risk exposure at any given point in time depends on the market environment  the expectations of future price and market movements  and the quantity and duration of long term us government and agency securities held by the company  and it will vary from period to period 
if the average interest rate on us government securities at december   were to increase by  and basis points  the average value of these securities held by us at december   would decrease by approximately   and  respectively  and the portion of our net asset value attributable to such securities would decrease correspondingly 
in addition  market interest rates for high yield corporate debt are an input in determining value of our investments in debt securities of privately held and publicly traded companies 
significant changes in these market rates could affect the value of our debt securities as of the date of measurement of value 
our investment income could be adversely affected should such debt securities include floating interest rates 
we do not currently have any investments in debt securities with floating interest rates 
foreign currency risk most of our investments are denominated in us dollars 
we currently have one investment denominated in canadian dollars 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk related to potential changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the potential loss in fair value on this investment resulting from a percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is  at december
