item legal proceedings ecopetrol and gran tierra colombia  the contracting parties of the guayuyaco association contract  are engaged in a dispute regarding the interpretation of the procedure for allocation of oil produced and sold during the long term test of the guayuyaco and guayuyaco wells 
there is a material difference in the interpretation of the procedure established in clause of attachment b of the guayuyaco association contract 
ecopetrol interprets the contract to provide that the extended test production up to a value equal to of the direct exploration costs of the wells is for ecopetrol s account only and serves as reimbursement of its back in to the guayuyaco discovery 
gran tierra colombia s contention is that this amount is merely the recovery of of the direct exploration costs of the wells and not exclusively for benefit of ecopetrol 
there has been no agreement between the parties  and ecopetrol has filed a lawsuit in the contravention administrative court in the district of cauca regarding this matter 
gran tierra colombia filed a response on april  in which it refuted all of ecopetrol s claims and requested a change of venue to the courts in bogota 
closing arguments were presented by all parties during we are awaiting the court s decision 
at this time no amount has been accrued in the financial statements as gran tierra does not consider it probable that a loss will be incurred 
ecopetrol is claiming damages of approximately million 
we have several other lawsuits and claims pending for which we currently cannot determine the ultimate result 
we record costs as they are incurred or become determinable 
we believe the resolution of these matters would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and supplementary data as set out in part ii item of this annual report on form k 
overview we are an independent international energy company incorporated in the united states and engaged in oil and natural gas acquisition  exploration  development and production 
we are headquartered in calgary  alberta  canada and operate in south america in colombia  argentina  peru  and brazil 
in september  we acquired our initial oil and gas interests and properties  which were in argentina 
during  we increased our oil and gas interests and property base through further acquisitions in colombia  argentina and peru 
we funded acquisitions of our properties in colombia and argentina through a series of private placements of our securities that occurred between september and june in  we made a new field discovery  costayaco  in the chaza block of the putumayo basin in colombia 
effective november   we completed the acquisition of solana resources limited solana  an international resource company engaged in the acquisition  exploration  development and production of oil and natural gas in colombia and incorporated in alberta  canada 
at the date of acquisition  solana held various working interests in nine blocks in colombia including a working interest in the chaza block  which includes the costayaco field  and a working interest in the guayuyaco block  which includes the juanambu field 
during the third quarter of  we opened a business development office in rio de janeiro  brazil 
in june  we expanded our land position in the putumayo basin and added new frontier exploration acreage in colombia through successful bids on three blocks in colombia 
in august and october respectively  we made new colombian field discoveries in moqueta in the chaza block putumayo basin and jilguero in the garibay block 
also in august  we finalized a farm in agreement with alvorada petroleo sa relating to the on shore reconcavo basin in brazil  pending regulatory approval from brazil s agencia nacional de petroleo gas natural e bioncombustiveis anp 
in peru in september  we acquired a working interest in three blocks and  in december  we acquired a interest in one block 
both transactions in peru are subject to government approval 
on january   we announced that we had entered into an arrangement agreement to acquire petrolifera petroleum ltd 
petrolifera 
petrolifera is a canadian based international oil and gas company listed on the toronto stock exchange which owns working interests in exploration and production blocks  three located in colombia  three in peru and five in argentina 
the arrangement agreement is subject to petrolifera shareholder and regulatory  stock exchange and court approvals  and is expected to close in march see subsequent events below for further details of this transaction 
business strategy our plan is to continue to build an international oil and gas company through acquisition and exploitation of under developed prospective oil and gas assets  and to develop these assets with exploration and development drilling to grow commercial reserves and production 
our initial focus is in select countries in south america  currently colombia  argentina  peru  and brazil  we will consider other regions for future growth should those regions make strategic and commercial sense in creating additional value 
we have applied a two stage approach to growth  initially establishing a base of production  development and exploration assets by selective acquisitions  and secondly achieving additional reserve and production growth through drilling 
we intend to duplicate this business model in other areas as opportunities arise 
we pursue opportunities in countries with proven petroleum systems  attractive royalty  taxation and other fiscal terms  and stable legal systems

the conversion ratio for natural gas to oil does not assume price equivalency and the price for a barrel of oil equivalent for natural gas may differ significantly from the price of a barrel of oil 
funds flow from operations is a non gaap measure which does not have any standardized meaning prescribed under united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
management uses this financial measure to analyze operating performance and the income loss generated by gran tierra s principal business activities prior to the consideration of how non cash items affect that income loss  and believes that this financial measure is also useful supplemental information for investors to analyze operating performance and gran tierra s financial results 
investors should be cautioned that this measure should not be construed as an alternative to net income loss or other measures of financial performance as determined in accordance with gaap 
gran tierra s method of calculating this measure may differ from other companies and  accordingly  it may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies 
funds flow from operations  as presented  is net income loss adjusted for depletion  depreciation  accretion and impairment  deferred taxes  stock based compensation  unrealized loss gain on financial instruments and unrealized foreign exchange losses gains 
a reconciliation from funds flow from operations to net income is as follows page of year ended december  funds flow from operations non gaap measure s net income adjustments to reconcile net income to funds flow from operations depletion  depreciation  accretion and impairment deferred taxes stock based compensation unrealized gain loss on financial instruments unrealized foreign exchange loss funds flows from operations financial highlights for the year ended december  in  production of crude oil net after royalty and inventory adjustments averaged  barrels of oil per day bopd  an increase of over  due mainly to production from new development wells in the costayaco field in the chaza block in colombia where gran tierra has a working interest 
production of natural gas averaged barrels of oil equivalent per day boepd from colombia 
revenue and other income increased by from due to increased production and higher oil prices 
a foreign exchange loss of million  of which million is an unrealized non cash foreign exchange loss  was recorded in primarily due to the translation of a deferred tax liability denominated in colombian pesos 
the devaluation of in the us dollar against the colombian peso in resulted in the foreign exchange loss 
this represents a decrease from the foreign exchange loss recorded in  of which million was an unrealized non cash foreign exchange loss related primarily to the same deferred tax liability

in the last half of  a successful workover program enhanced the productivity of the costayaco field 
in september and october  a planned water injection facility was completed and water injection commenced from costayaco and costayaco into the t sand for reservoir maintenance and maximization of oil recovery 
costayaco and costayaco drilling commenced in december moqueta field exploration and delineation in june  we completed initial testing on the moqueta exploration well in the chaza block in colombia 
the moqueta delineation well was drilled in july from the existing moqueta pad 
the moqueta appraisal well was completed and tested in october  and confirmed oil bearing reservoirs in the villeta u and t sandstones and caballos reservoir sandstones 
the moqueta development well was in progress at december  and testing will be complete in march additional seismic was also acquired during the year 
construction of the moqueta to costayaco pipeline is expected to commence in the first quarter of and first oil production is anticipated in the second quarter of dantayaco field exploration testing of dantayaco was completed and the well plugged and abandoned in january pacayaco field exploration pacayaco commenced drilling in november and was suspended pending acquisition and interpretation of seismic 
the acquisition and interpretation is now complete and either a new well or a sidetrack of the existing well will be drilled late in the second quarter of rio guineo exploration seismic relating to this lead was acquired during the year 
garibay block testing of jilguero in the garibay block was completed in october and long term production testing began in january rio magdalena block popa  an appraisal well in the rio magdalena block  has been drilled and logged and gas bearing reservoirs identified

production represents production volumes adjusted for inventory changes 
page of consolidated results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the results for the year ended december  net income of million  or per share basic and per share diluted  was recorded in compared to million  or per share basic and per share diluted  in a increase in revenue and other income to million from million recorded in was partially offset by an million increase in operating expenses  a million increase in general and administrative expenses  a million increase in dd a  and a million increase in income tax expense 
revenue and other income increased as a result of a increase in crude oil production combined with a improvement in crude oil prices 
crude oil and ngl production  net after royalties  in increased to million barrels compared to million barrels in  due to increased production from our colombia operations 
average realized crude oil prices for increased to per barrel from per barrel in  reflecting higher west texas intermediate wti oil prices 
the additional government royalty for the costayaco field described in segmented operations colombia began in the fourth quarter of and was paid for only three months of versus the full year of as a result  our share of production was reduced by a total of  boe s relating to this additional royalty in as compared to only  boe s in since our production volumes are reported net after royalties and this royalty structure was not in place for an equal amount of time in and  certain changes between these years  including volumes  changes in per boe operating costs  and per boe general and administrative costs  will not be readily comparable 
for instance  the increase in the costayaco field production will not appear as high in comparison with as it would appear without the additional royalty volumes deducted 
similarly  the per boe operating and general and administrative costs will appear higher on a per boe basis in than in as the costs are divided over a smaller base after royalties are deducted 
operating expenses for amounted to million  a increase from the prior year total of million 
the increase in operating expenses occurred primarily in colombia and was due to an enhanced workover program related to the costayaco area  an increase in transportation costs related to increased production and pipeline maintenance  and an increase in producing wells in costayaco 
operating expenses on a boe basis in were  a increase from reflecting both the increase in total operating costs and the effect of the additional government royalty payable on per boe calculations  partially offset by an increase in production 
dd a expense for increased to million compared to million in the increase in production levels was partially offset by an increase of reserves at year end and a reduction of future development costs included in the depletable base as compared to dd a expense in included a million ceiling test impairment for our argentina cost center  including million relating to the abandonment of the gte 
st 
vmor sidetrack operations  as compared to a million charge in on a boe basis  dd a in was compared to for  representing a increase resulting from the ceiling test impairment loss offset partially by increased reserves and decreased future development costs 
g a expenses of million for was higher than due to increased employee related costs reflecting the expansion of operations in peru  brazil  and colombia and higher business development costs 
g a expenses per boe increased to per boe compared to per boe for the increase in general and administrative costs on a per boe basis over the prior year was compounded by the additional royalty paid in the foreign exchange loss of million for  of which million is an unrealized non cash foreign exchange loss  compares to million recorded in  of which million is an unrealized non cash foreign exchange loss 
these losses originate in colombia and relate to foreign exchange losses resulting from the translation of a deferred tax liability 
income tax expense for amounted to million compared to million recorded in this represents an increase of in annual income tax expense  primarily as a result of higher profits and the application of a valuation allowance against previously recognized deferred tax assets associated with argentina

the variance from the us statutory rate for results from foreign currency translation losses that are neither taxable nor deductible for tax purposes in each of the respective jurisdictions  the valuation allowances as described above  enhanced tax depreciation incentive in colombia  and colombia third party royalty payments that are not deductible for tax purposes 
similar factors cause the variance from the us statutory rate for consolidated results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the results for the year ended december  as a result of the solana acquisition  we increased our working interest to in the costayaco field and in the juanambu field  in colombia  which resulted in increased production  revenue  operating costs  and dd a in page of net income of million  or per share basic and per share diluted  was recorded in compared to million  or per share basic and per share diluted  in a foreign exchange loss of million  of which million is an unrealized non cash foreign exchange loss  an increase of million in dd a to million  higher operating and general and administrative expenses  and increased income tax expense  more than offset the higher oil revenues in revenue and interest increased to million in compared to million in this was due to an increase of in crude oil production partially offset by a decrease in crude oil prices 
crude oil and ngl production  net after royalties  in increased to million barrels compared to million barrels in  due mainly to increased production from our colombia operations 
average realized crude oil prices for decreased to per barrel from per barrel in  reflecting lower wti oil prices 
operating expenses for amounted to million  a increase from the prior year 
the increase in operating expenses is due to expanded operations and increased production levels in colombia

for the year ended december   production of crude oil and ngls  net after royalties  increased by to million barrels compared to million barrels in the increase in production is primarily due to the increase in wells on stream in costayaco and the success of the costayaco workover program 
production levels are after government royalties ranging from to and third party royalties of to 
the additional government royalty paid in discussed in consolidated results of operations reduced the increase in total production from the costayaco field as compared to the prior year 
gran tierra s colombian operating results for the year ended december  were principally driven by the increase in production volumes and the associated increase in workover  transportation  operating  g a and dd a expenses 
in  colombia production included costayaco       january  and june  juanambu and  and the santana block 
in  colombia production included costayaco  july  september  and juanambu outages on the ecopetrol operated trans andean pipeline ota result when sections of the pipeline are damaged 
outages reduced our deliveries to ecopetrol for days in days in june and days in september  as compared to days in days in july and august and days in june 
in january  the juanambu and costayaco fields were also shut in for days due to a general strike in the region where our operations are located 
the overall decrease in sales as a result of the disruptions is estimated to be approximately of total sales in and of total sales in revenue and interest were positively affected by an increase in net realized crude oil prices in compared to the average net realized prices for crude oil  which are based on wti prices  increased by to per barrel for the year ended december  compared to increased production combined with the increased net realized crude oil price resulted in our revenue and interest from colombia for the year ended december  increasing by to million from levels 
as a result of achieving gross field production of five million barrels in our costayaco field during the month of september  gran tierra became subject to an additional government royalty payable 
the additional royalty is calculated on of the field production revenue over an inflation adjusted trigger point

the additional government royalty paid in as compared to further increased the per boe operating cost amounts from for  dd a expense increased to million from million in increased production levels partially offset by higher crude oil reserve levels and a lower future development cost added to the depletable base  accounted for the increase in dd a expense 
on a per boe basis  the dd a expense in colombia decreased by to for  compared with for  due to higher production offset by increased proved reserves and lower future development costs 
higher g a expenses incurred to manage the increased level of development and operating activities resulted in g a expense increasing to million for the year ended december  from million incurred in on a per boe basis  g a expense in increased by to from in  due to higher costs partially offset by higher production

the unrealized non cash foreign exchange loss resulted primarily from the translation of a deferred tax liability recognized on the purchase of solana 
this deferred tax liability  a monetary liability  is denominated in the local currency of the colombian foreign operations and as a result  foreign exchange gains and losses have been calculated on conversion to the us dollar functional currency 
a strengthening in the colombian peso against the us dollar results in foreign exchange losses  estimated at  for each one peso decrease in the exchange rate of the colombian peso to one us dollar at december  page of segmented results of operations colombia for the year ended december  compared to the results for the year ended december  for the year ended december   income before income taxes from colombia amounted to million compared to income before taxes of million recorded in an increase in production revenue was more than offset by increased expenses including a million increase in foreign exchange loss to million  of which million is an unrealized non cash foreign exchange loss  primarily due to the translation of deferred taxes 
also  a million increase in dd a  primarily a result of the amortization of the fair value of solana s property  plant and equipment recorded upon our acquisition of solana  partially offset the increase in production revenue 
higher operating expenses due to increased colombian production and increased general and administrative expenses from expanded activities also contributed to a reduction in income before income taxes 
for the year ended december   production of crude oil and ngls  net after royalties  increased by to million barrels compared to million barrels in the incremental production volumes from solana properties for the year ended december  were million barrels of oil  compared to  barrels of oil subsequent to the acquisition of solana on november  these production levels are after government royalties ranging from to and third party royalties of to 
gran tierra s colombian operating results for the year ended december  are principally impacted by the inclusion of production from three new development wells in the costayaco field  including solana s share of production from costayaco  and solana s share of production from juanambu in the guayuyaco block 
in  colombia production included production from costayaco      and juanambu along with production from the santana block 
our production in and was impacted by political and economic factors in colombia 
in the second and third quarter of  and the first and second quarter of  sections of the ecopetrol operated trans andean pipeline were damaged  which temporarily reduced our deliveries to ecopetrol 
on november   we temporarily suspended production operations in the costayaco and juanambu oil fields 
this was as a result of a declaration of a state of emergency and force majeure by ecopetrol  due to a general strike in the region where our operations are located 
on january   crude oil transportation resumed in southern colombia as a result of the lifting of the strike at the orito facilities operated by ecopetrol 
as a result of these factors  deliveries to ecopetrol in were reduced to approximately  bopd  net after royalties  for days between july and august  and reduced to approximately  bopd  net after royalties  for days in june  and we were shut in for the first days of january 
during the first quarter of  deliveries to ecopetrol were reduced to approximately  bopd  net after royalties  for days and in the second quarter of deliveries were reduced to approximately  bopd  net after royalties  for days 
revenue and interest were negatively impacted by a decline in net realized crude oil prices in compared to the average net realized prices for crude oil  which are based on wti prices  decreased by to per barrel for the year ended december  compared to however  substantially increased production resulted in our revenue and interest from colombia for the year ended december  increasing by to million from as a result of achieving gross field production of five million barrels in our costayaco field during the month of september  gran tierra is now subject to an additional government royalty payable 
this royalty is calculated on of the field production revenue over an inflation adjusted trigger point

at december   million has been capitalized and accrued in relation to this contract  the terms of which  are consistent with market conditions 
in connection with the solana acquisition  we acquired additional office space of  square feet used by solana as its headquarters in calgary 
on february   we entered into a sublease for that office space with a company  of which one of gran tierra s directors is a shareholder and director 
the term of the sublease runs from february  to august  and the sublease payment is  per month plus approximately  for operating and other expenses 
the terms of the sublease were consistent with market conditions in the calgary real estate market 
page of subsequent events on january   we entered into an agreement to acquire all the issued and outstanding shares and warrants of petrolifera petroleum limited petrolifera 
petrolifera is a canadian based international oil and gas company that trades on the toronto stock exchange and has oil and gas assets in argentina  colombia  and peru 
under the terms of the agreement  petrolifera shareholders will receive of a share of gran tierra energy  for every petrolifera share held 
in addition  we will issue replacement warrants for the outstanding warrants to purchase petrolifera common shares  in the amount of of a gran tierra warrant for each petrolifera warrant 
a total of approximately million of gran tierra s shares are expected to be issued in the transaction  which represents approximately an increase in shares outstanding 
total consideration for the transaction will be approximately million  including the assumption of petrolifera s debt  working capital and investments as of september  the agreement is subject to regulatory  court  stock exchange  and petrolifera securityholder approvals and is scheduled to close in march on january   we entered into an agreement to sublease office space to a company for which gran tierra s president and chief executive officer serves as an independent director 
the term of the sublease runs from february  to january  and  at  per month  the terms are consistent with market conditions in the calgary  alberta  canada real estate market 
outlook business environment our revenues have been positively impacted by the increase in crude oil prices from the prior year 
crude oil prices are volatile and unpredictable and are influenced by concerns about financial markets and the impact of the downturn in the worldwide economy on oil demand growth 
further  following the acquisition of petrolifera through a share exchange  announced january and expected to close in march  we expect to retire petrolifera s bank debt  which will reduce our cash by approximately million 
however  based on projected production  prices  costs and our current liquidity position  we believe that our current operations and capital expenditure program can be maintained from cash flow from existing operations and cash on hand  barring unforeseen events or a severe downturn in oil and gas prices 
should our operating cash flow decline  we would examine measures such as reducing our capital expenditure program  issuance of debt  disposition of assets  or issuance of equity 
our future growth and acquisitions may depend on our ability to raise additional funds through equity and debt markets 
determination of the borrowing base under our credit facility will most likely be dependent on our success in maintaining or increasing oil and gas reserves and on future oil prices 
should we be required to raise debt or equity financing to fund capital expenditures or other acquisition and development opportunities  such funding may be affected by the market value of our common stock 
if the price of our common stock declines  our ability to utilize our stock to raise capital may be negatively affected 
also  raising funds by issuing stock or other equity securities would further dilute our existing stockholders  and this dilution would be exacerbated by a decline in our stock price 
any securities we issue may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to our existing equity securities 
borrowing money may also involve pledging of some or all of our assets 
volatility in the credit markets may increase costs associated with renewing or issuing debt  or affect our  or third parties we seek to do business with  ability to access those markets 
work program and capital expenditure program in december  prior to the finalization and announcement of the petrolifera acquisition  we announced the details of gran tierra s work program 
gran tierra s work program is intended to create both growth and value in our existing assets through increasing our reserves and production from exploration financed by cash flow  while retaining financial flexibility with a strong cash position and no debt  so that we can be positioned to undertake further development opportunities and to pursue acquisition opportunities 
however  actual capital expenditures may vary significantly from our work program if unexpected events or circumstances occur  such as new opportunities present themselves  or anticipated opportunities do not come to fruition  which may therefore either increase or decrease the amount of capital expenditures we incur in capital commitments and other exploration and development opportunities arising from the petrolifera acquisition were not contemplated in the original capital program and may have a significant impact on the amount and allocation of capital expenditures for each country 
the effect of the acquisition on the capital program will be assessed on an ongoing basis 
excluding potential exploration success  production in is expected to range between  and  boepd net after royalty 
gran tierra has planned a capital spending program of million for exploration and development activities in colombia  peru  argentina and brazil 
planned capital expenditures are million in colombia  million in peru  million in argentina  and million in brazil 
we expect that our committed and discretionary capital program can be funded from cash flow from operations and cash on hand 
the details of the capital programs planned for each country do not contemplate any effect of the petrolifera acquisition and the portfolio of prospects and commitments that the acquisition includes 
the following outlook represents the capital program based upon the current portfolio of gran tierra properties 
page of outlook colombia the capital program in colombia is million 
facility construction associated with ongoing development of the moqueta field and further facility work at costayaco is expected to be million 
million is budgeted for seismic and million for exploration and development drilling 
the drilling program includes four gross development wells and a six well exploration program that comprises four gross exploration wells and two stratigraphic test wells 
the exploration drilling program in colombia includes exploration wells  stratigraphic test wells and seismic acquisitions including km of d seismic and km of d seismic 
in addition to the above exploration activity we plan to spend approximately million on infrastructure  which includes flow lines  gas reinjection facilities  road access construction and full field development planning 
outlook argentina the capital program in argentina is million 
gran tierra s planned work program for includes costs related to the re entry and sidetrack of the gte 
st 
vmor well and related facilities upgrades  as well as the drilling of a development well in palmar largo  workovers in el vinalar  facility construction  and geophysical work 
in february  the sidetrack and re entry operations at the gte 
st 
vmor well were suspended and the well bore will be abandoned while gran tierra evaluates other options associated with field development 
the capital budget may be revised based on the results of the evaluation 
outlook peru the capital program in peru is million  including million related to drilling exploration wells and an additional million related to seismic 
gran tierra began drilling the first exploration well in block in february and plans to drill the second exploration well on block in the third quarter of of block was also relinquished in february seismic activity is planned to continue in blocks   and with exploration drilling environmental impact assessments to be conducted concurrently in blocks and upon approval of assignment of interests to gran tierra by perupetro sa  gran tierra plans to drill one exploration well on block in the fourth quarter of outlook brazil the capital program in brazil is million and includes million budgeted for drilling and completions and the remainder relates to acquisition costs of the working interest ownership as described below 
upon the anticipated regulatory approval from brazil s agencia nacional de petroleo  gas natural e biocombustiveis anp  gran tierra will hold a working interest in blocks rec t    and in the onshore reconcavo basin 
the first exploration well in block is planned for the second quarter of and will be followed by up to three additional exploration wells including two wells on block and one well on block additionally  two appraisal wells on block are planned to further develop the existing alv ba well discovery on the block 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements under generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the critical accounting policies used by management in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regards to estimates used 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in oil and gas accounting and reserves determination  establishment of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired as part of acquisitions  impairment  asset retirement obligations  goodwill impairment  deferred income taxes  share based payment arrangements  and warrants have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
these areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates  so we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates 
our critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates related to those policies are discussed below 
page of actual results could differ from these estimates  however  historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results 
on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates 
we also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
oil and gas accounting reserves determination we follow the full cost method of accounting for our investment in oil and natural gas properties  as defined by the us securities and exchange commission sec  as described in note to our annual consolidated financial statements 
full cost accounting depends on the estimated reserves we believe are recoverable from our oil and gas reserves 
the process of estimating reserves is complex 
it requires significant judgments and decisions based on available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
to estimate the economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and related future net cash flows  we incorporate many factors and assumptions including expected reservoir characteristics based on geological  geophysical and engineering assessments future production rates based on historical performance and expected future operating and investment activities future commodity prices future oil and gas quality differentials assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies future development and operating costs we believe our assumptions are reasonable based on the information available to us at the time we prepare our estimates 
however  these estimates may change substantially as additional data from ongoing development activities and production performance becomes available and as economic conditions impacting oil and gas prices and costs change 
management is responsible for estimating the quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and for preparing related disclosures 
estimates and related disclosures are prepared in accordance with sec requirements and generally accepted industry practices in the united states as prescribed by the society of petroleum engineers 
reserve estimates are audited at least annually by independent qualified reserves consultants 
our board of directors oversees the annual review of our oil and gas reserves and related disclosures 
the board meets with management periodically to review the reserves process  results and related disclosures and appoints and meets with the independent reserves consultants to review the scope of their work  whether they have had access to sufficient information  the nature and satisfactory resolution of any material differences of opinion  and in the case of the independent reserves consultants  their independence 
reserves estimates are critical to many of our accounting estimates  including determining whether or not an exploratory well has found economically producible reserves calculating our unit of production depletion rates 
proved reserves estimates are used to determine rates that are applied to each unit of production in calculating our depletion expense 
assessing  when necessary  our oil and gas assets for impairment 
estimated future cash flows are determined using proved reserves 
the critical estimates used to assess impairment  including the impact of changes in reserves estimates  are discussed below oil and gas accounting and impairment the accounting for and disclosure of oil and gas producing activities requires that we choose between gaap alternatives 
we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas operations 
under this method  separate cost centers are maintained for each country in which we incur costs 
all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of properties including costs of surrendered and abandoned leaseholds  delay lease rentals  dry holes and overhead related to exploration and development activities are capitalized 
the sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development costs of oil and natural gas properties for each full cost center are depleted using the unit of production method 
changes in estimates of proved reserves  future development costs or asset retirement obligations are accounted for prospectively in our depletion calculation 
investments in unproved properties are not depleted pending the determination of the existence of proved reserves 
unproved properties are assessed periodically to ascertain whether impairment has occurred 
unproved properties  the costs of which are individually significant  are assessed individually by considering the primary lease terms of the properties  the holding period of the properties  and geographic and geologic data obtained relating to the properties 
where it is not practicable to individually assess the amount of impairment of properties for which costs are not individually significant  these properties are grouped for purposes of assessing impairment 
the amount of impairment assessed is added to the costs to be amortized in the appropriate full cost pool 
page of the acquisition of solana was accounted for using the purchase method  with gran tierra being the acquirer  whereby the solana assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values at the acquisition date with the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and intangible net assets acquired recorded as goodwill 
calculation of fair values of assets and liabilities  which was done with the assistance of independent advisors  is subject to estimates which include various assumptions including the extent of proved and unproved reserves of the acquired company as well as the future production and development costs and the future oil and gas prices 
while these estimates of fair value for the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed have no effect on our liquidity or capital resources  they can have an effect on the future results of operations 
generally  the higher the fair value assigned to both oil and gas properties and non oil and gas properties  the lower future net income will be as a result of higher future depreciation  depletion and accretion expense 
also  a higher fair value assigned to the oil and gas properties  based on higher future estimates of oil and gas prices  will increase the likelihood of a full cost ceiling write down in the event that future oil and gas prices drop below our price forecast that we used to originally determine fair value 
companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test calculation each quarter on a country by country basis 
the ceiling limits these pooled costs to the aggregate of the after tax  present value  discounted at  of future cash flows attributable to proved reserves  known as the standardized measure  plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties less any associated tax effects 
cash flow estimates for our impairment assessments require assumptions about two primary elements constant prices and reserves 
it is difficult to determine and assess the impact of a decrease in our proved reserves on our impairment tests 
the relationship between the reserves estimate and the estimated discounted cash flows is complex because of the necessary assumptions that need to be made regarding period end production rates  twelve month unweighted average prices and costs 
if these capitalized costs exceed the ceiling  we will record a write down to the extent of such excess as a non cash charge to earnings 
any such write down will reduce earnings in the period of occurrence and result in lower dd a expense in future periods 
a write down may not be reversed in future periods  even though higher oil and natural gas prices may subsequently increase the ceiling 
due to the complexity of the calculation  we are unable to provide a reasonable sensitivity analysis of the impact that a reserves estimate decrease would have on our assessment of impairment 
a reduction in oil and natural gas prices and or estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves would reduce the ceiling limitation and could result in a ceiling test write down 
we assessed our oil and gas properties for impairment as at december  and found no impairment write down was required based on our assumptions for our colombia cost center 
as a result of assessing our oil and gas property impairment for our argentina cost center  a ceiling test impairment loss of million was recorded as a result of the abandonment of the gte 
st 
vmor sidetrack operations  an increase in estimated future operating costs to produce our remaining argentine proved reserves and a decrease in reserve volumes 
we assessed our oil and gas properties for impairment as at december  and and found that an impairment write down of million was required in for our argentina cost center and that no impairment write downs were required in based on our assumptions 
estimates of standardized measure of our future cash flows from proved reserves for our december  ceiling tests were based on realized crude oil prices of and per mcf in colombia and for oil production in argentina 
asset retirement obligations we are required to remove or remedy the effect of our activities on the environment at our present and former operating sites by dismantling and removing production facilities and remediating any damage caused 
estimating our future asset retirement obligations requires us to make estimates and judgments with respect to activities that will occur many years into the future 
in addition  the ultimate financial impact of environmental laws and regulations is not always clearly known and cannot be reasonably estimated as standards evolve in the countries in which we operate 
we record asset retirement obligations in our consolidated financial statements by discounting the present value of the estimated retirement obligations associated with our oil and gas wells and facilities 
in arriving at amounts recorded  we make numerous assumptions and judgments with respect to ultimate settlement amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement and expected changes in legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
the asset retirement obligations result in an increase to the carrying cost of our property  plant and equipment 
the obligations are accreted with the passage of time 
a change in any one of our assumptions could impact our asset retirement obligations  our property  plant and equipment and our net income 
it is difficult to determine the impact of a change in any one of our assumptions 
as a result  we are unable to provide a reasonable sensitivity analysis of the impact a change in our assumptions would have on our financial results 
page of goodwill goodwill represents the excess of purchase price of business combinations over the fair value of net assets acquired and we test for impairment at least annually 
the impairment test requires allocating goodwill and certain other assets and liabilities to reporting units 
we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the net book value of the reporting unit 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the net book value  including goodwill  we write down the goodwill to the implied fair value of the goodwill through a charge to expense 
because quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units  we estimate the fair values of the reporting units based upon estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit 
the goodwill on our financial statements was a result of the solana and argosy acquisitions  and relates entirely to the colombia reporting segment 
this reporting segment is not at risk of failing the step goodwill impairment test under financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  intangibles goodwill and others 
the calculated fair value of the colombian business unit was significantly in excess of its book values 
differences in the our actual future cash flows  operating results  growth rates  capital expenditures  cost of capital and discount rates as compared to the estimates utilized for the purpose of calculating the fair value of each business unit  as well as a decline in our stock price and related market capitalization  could affect the results of our annual goodwill assessment and  accordingly  potentially lead to future goodwill impairment charges 
income taxes we follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences in reported amounts for financial statement and tax purposes 
we carry on business in several countries and as a result  we are subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions 
the determination of our income tax provision is inherently complex and we are required to interpret continually changing regulations and make certain judgments 
while income tax filings are subject to audits and reassessments  we believe we have made adequate provision for all income tax obligations 
however  changes in facts and circumstances as a result of income tax audits  reassessments  jurisprudence and any new legislation may result in an increase or decrease in our provision for income taxes 
to assess the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
our effective tax rate is based on pre tax income and the tax rates applicable to that income in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
an estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to our quarterly operating results 
in the event that there is a significant unusual or discrete item recognized  or expected to be recognized  in our quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or discrete item 
we consider the resolution of prior year tax matters to be such items 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves when it is more likely than not that we will not realize the full tax benefit of the position 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances 
share based payment arrangements we record share based payment arrangements in accordance with the asc  compensation stock compensation  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options based on estimated fair values 
asc requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statement of operations 
under asc  share based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of share based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period 
compensation expense is recognized using the accelerated method 
as share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
under asc  we utilize a black scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
our determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
we are responsible for determining the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our share based payment awards 
page of warrants we follow the fair value method of accounting for warrants issued to purchase our common stock 
new accounting pronouncements variable interest entities in june  the fasb issued revised accounting standards to improve financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities 
the standards replace the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise  if any  has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity  or  the right to receive benefits from the entity 
the standards was implemented prospectively on january  and did not materially impact gran tierra s consolidated financial position  operating results or cash flows 
fair value measurements in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this asu amends existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurements by adding required disclosures about items transferred into and out of levels and in the fair value hierarchy  adding separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements relative to level measurements  and clarifying  among other things  the existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation 
this is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
the implementation of this update on january  did not materially impact gran tierra s disclosures 
subsequent events in february  the fasb issued asu  subsequent events topic 
the amendments remove the requirements for an sec filer to disclose a date  in both issued and revised financial statements  through which subsequent events have been reviewed 
this asu was effective upon issuance 
the implementation of this update did not materially impact gran tierra s disclosures 
stock compensation in april  the fasb issued asu  compensation stock compensation topic 
the amendments clarify that an employee share based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entity s equity securities trades should not be considered to contain a condition that is not a market  performance  or service condition 
therefore  an entity would not classify such an award as a liability if it otherwise qualifies as equity 
this asu is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  the implementation of this update is not expected to materially impact gran tierra s consolidated financial position  operating results or cash flows 
receivables in july  the fasb issued asu  receivables topic 
the update is intended to provide financial statement users with greater transparency about an entity s allowance for credit losses and the credit quality of its financing receivables 
the disclosures as of the end of a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after december  the implementation of this update did not materially impact gran tierra s disclosures 
business combinations in december  the fasb issued asu  business combinations topic  disclosures of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
the update is intended to conform reporting of pro forma revenue and earnings for material business combinations included in the notes to the financial statements and expand disclosure of non recurring adjustments that are directly attributable to the business combination 
the pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity are presented as if the acquisition date had occurred as of the beginning of the annual reporting period 
if comparatives are presented  the pro forma disclosures for both periods presented should be reported as if the acquisition had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
this asu is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the implementation of this update is not expected to materially impact gran tierra s disclosures 
page of gran tierra has reviewed all other recently issued  but not yet adopted  accounting standard updates in order to determine their effects  if any  on its consolidated financial statements 
based on that review  gran tierra believes that the implementation of these standards will not materially impact gran tierra s consolidated financial position  operating results  cash flows  or disclosure requirments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our principal market risk relates to oil prices 
essentially of our revenues are from oil sales at prices which are defined by contract relative to wti and adjusted for transportation and quality  for each month 
in argentina  a further discount factor which is related to a tax on oil exports establishes a common pricing mechanism for all oil produced in the country  regardless of its destination 
we consider our exposure to interest rate risk to be immaterial as we hold only cash and cash equivalents 
interest rate exposures relate entirely to our investment portfolio  as we do not have short term or long term debt 
our investment objectives are focused on preservation of principal and liquidity 
by policy  we manage our exposure to market risks by limiting investments to high quality bank issuers at overnight rates  or government securities of the united states or canadian federal governments such as guaranteed investment certificates or treasury bills 
we do not hold any of these investments for trading purposes 
we do not hold equity investments 
foreign currency risk is a factor for our company but is ameliorated to a large degree by the nature of expenditures and revenues in the countries where we operate 
we have not engaged in any formal hedging activity with regard to foreign currency risk 
our reporting currency is us dollars and essentially of our revenues are related to the us price of west texas intermediate oil 
in colombia  we receive of our revenues in us dollars 
the majority of our capital expenditures in colombia are in us dollars and the majority of local office costs are in local currency 
in argentina  reference prices for oil are in us dollars and revenues are received in argentine pesos according to current exchange rates 
the majority of capital expenditures within argentina have been in us dollars with local office costs generally in pesos 
while we operate in south america exclusively  the majority of our acquisition expenditures have been valued and paid in us dollars 
additionally  foreign exchange gains losses result from the fluctuation of the us dollar to the colombian peso due to our deferred tax liability  a monetary liability  which is mainly denominated in the local currency of the colombian foreign operations 
as a result  a foreign exchange gain loss must be calculated on conversion to the us dollar functional currency 
a strengthening in the colombian peso against the us dollar results in foreign exchange losses  estimated at  for each one peso decrease in the exchange rate of the colombian peso to one us dollar
