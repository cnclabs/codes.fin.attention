item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the world s leading vertically integrated producers  marketers and distributors of high quality fresh and fresh cut fruit and vegetables  as well as a leading producer and marketer of prepared fruit and vegetables  juices  beverages and snacks in europe  africa and the middle east 
we market our products worldwide under the del monte brand  a symbol of product innovation  quality  freshness and reliability since our global sourcing and logistics system allows us to provide regular delivery of consistently high quality produce and value added services to our customers 
our major producing operations are located in north  central and south america  asia and africa 
production operations are aggregated on the basis of our products bananas  other fresh produce  prepared foods and other products and services 
other fresh produce includes pineapples  melons  tomatoes  non tropical fruit including grapes  apples  pears  peaches  plums  nectarines  avocados  citrus and kiwis  fresh cut produce and other fruit and vegetables 
prepared foods include prepared fruit and vegetables  juices  beverages  snacks  poultry and meat products 
other products and services includes a plastic product and box manufacturing business  a grain business and third party ocean freight services 
strategy our strategy is focused on a combination of maximizing revenues from our existing infrastructure  entering new markets and strict cost control initiatives 
we plan to continue to capitalize on the growing global demand for fresh produce and expand our reach into existing and new markets 
we expect sales growth of fresh produce in key markets by increasing sales volume and per unit sales prices as permitted by market conditions 
our acquisitions substantially increased our production capability of bananas  pineapples and continue to provide the potential over time for further operating efficiencies and synergies 
in addition  our number one position in the gold pineapple market has been further strengthened 
our strategy includes increasing volumes from existing production and distribution facilities in order to improve operating efficiencies and reduce per unit costs 
we plan additional investments in production facilities in order to expand our product offering in established markets and continue with our recent expansion in growth markets  such as the middle east  africa and countries formerly part of the soviet union 
net sales our net sales are affected by numerous factors  including mainly the balance between the supply of and demand for our produce and competition from other fresh produce companies 
our net sales are also dependent on our ability to supply a consistent volume and quality of fresh produce to the markets we serve 
for example  seasonal variations in demand for bananas as a result of increased supply and competition from other fruit are reflected in the seasonal fluctuations in banana prices  with the first six months of each year generally exhibiting stronger demand and higher prices  except in those years where an excess supply exists 
during  there were generally higher supplies of bananas in the markets 
our overall banana sales volume increased by and our average per unit sales prices decreased 
in the processed foods business  we generally realize the largest portion of our net sales and gross profit in the third and fourth quarters of the year 
during  our prepared food net sales increased as a result of increased demand for our jordanian poultry and processed meat products  canned pineapples and beverage products in sub saharan africa 
since our financial reporting currency is the us dollar  our net sales are significantly affected by fluctuations in the value of the currency in which we conduct our sales versus the dollar  with a weak dollar versus such currencies resulting in increased net sales in dollar terms 
including the effect of our foreign currency hedges  net sales for were positively impacted by million  as compared to  principally as a result of a stronger japanese yen and korean won  partially offset by a weaker euro and british pound  versus the us dollar 
our net sales growth in recent years has been achieved primarily through increased sales volume in existing markets of other fresh produce  primarily pineapples and non tropical fruit  and favorable pricing on our del monte gold extra sweet pineapple combined with increased sales volume and per unit sales prices of bananas in existing and new markets 
during  our net sales were positively affected by higher sales volume of bananas and gold pineapples that resulted from our recent acquisitions and production expansion  which were offset principally by lower net sales of melons and other products and services 
our net sales growth in recent years is also attributable to a broadening of our product line with the expansion of our fresh cut produce business and our expansion into new markets 
we expect our net sales growth to continue to be driven by increased sales volumes in our banana  other fresh produce and the prepared food segments 
in the middle east  we expect to continue to increase our net sales of our fresh produce and prepared food product offerings as a result of our expansion in the saudi arabian and other regional markets 
we also expect to increase our sales by developing new products in the prepared food segment  targeting the convenience store and foodservice trade in selected european and middle east markets 
cost of products sold cost of products sold is principally composed of two elements  product and logistics costs 
product cost for our produce is primarily composed of cultivation the cost of growing crops  harvesting  packaging  labor  depreciation and farm administration 
product cost for produce obtained from independent growers is composed of produce and packaging costs 
logistics costs include land and sea transportation and expenses related to port facilities and distribution centers 
sea transportation cost is the most significant component of logistics costs and is comprised of the cost of vessel operating expenses and chartering refrigerated vessels 
vessel operating expenses for our owned vessels include operations  maintenance  depreciation  insurance  fuel the cost of which is subject to commodity price fluctuations  and port charges 
for chartered vessels  operating expenses include the cost of chartering the vessels  fuel and port charges 
variations in containerboard prices  which affect the cost of boxes and other packaging materials  and fuel prices can have a significant impact on our product cost and our profit margins 
also  variations in the production yields  fertilizers and other input costs and the cost to procure products from independent growers can have a significant impact on our costs 
containerboard  plastic  resin and fuel prices have historically been volatile 
during  fuel prices decreased by and containerboard decreased as compared with  reducing cost of products sold by million 
this decrease in cost of products sold that resulted from lower fuel and containerboard prices was offset by an increase in production costs due to lower yields and higher input costs and increased cost of produce from independent growers of approximately million and a charge of million related to growing crop inventory as a result of our decision to discontinue pineapple operations in brazil 
during  cost of fuel increased by and containerboard increased by  increasing our cost of product sold by million 
in addition  we incurred million of increased costs for inventory write offs and other costs associated with exit activities in brazil  floods in guatemala and damages caused by an earthquake in chile  partially offset by insurance reimbursements 
in general  changes in our volume of products sold can have a disproportionate effect on our gross profit 
within any particular year  a significant portion of our cost of products sold is fixed  both with respect to our operations and with respect to the cost of produce purchased from independent growers from whom we have agreed to purchase all the products they produce 
accordingly  higher volumes produced on company owned farms directly reduce the average per box cost  while lower volumes directly increase the average per box cost 
in addition  because the volume that will actually be produced on our farms and by independent growers in any given year depends on a variety of factors  including weather  that are beyond our control or the control of our independent growers  it is difficult to predict volumes and per box costs 
since our financial reporting currency is the us dollar  our costs are affected by fluctuations in the value of the currency in which we have significant operations versus the dollar  with a weak dollar versus those currencies resulting in increased costs 
during  cost of products sold was negatively impacted by approximately million as a result of a weaker us dollar versus the various currencies in which we have significant operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses primarily include the costs associated with selling in countries where we have our own sales force  advertising and promotional expenses  professional fees  general corporate overhead and other related administrative functions

provision for benefit from income taxes the provision for benefit from income taxes in was a benefit of million and includes a benefit of million as a result of a change in estimate  combined with reversals of uncertain tax positions and release of valuation allowance in certain jurisdictions 
income taxes consist of the consolidation of the tax provisions  computed on a separate entity basis  in each country in which we have operations 
since we are a non us company with substantial operations outside the united states  a substantial portion of our results of operations is not subject to us taxation 
several of the countries in which we operate have favorable tax rates 
we are subject to us taxation on our operations in the united states 
from time to time  tax authorities in various jurisdictions in which we operate audit our tax returns and review our tax positions 
there are audits presently pending in various countries 
there can be no assurance that any tax audits  or changes in existing tax laws or interpretations in countries in which we operate  will not result in an increased effective tax rate for us

based on our operating plan  combined with our borrowing capacity under our credit facility  we believe we will have sufficient resources to meet our cash obligations in the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
primarily as a result of the discontinuance of our brazil melon operations  we paid approximately million in termination benefits in we expect to make additional payments of approximately million principally related to the previously announced closure of our hawaii pineapple operations and the under utilized facility in the united kingdom 
these cash outlays and other expected cash outlays in the range of million to million  as a result of the reduction of planted areas due to plant disease in the philippines banana operation  will be funded from operating cash flows and available borrowings under credit facilities 
the principal capital expenditures planned for consist primarily of the expansion of production facilities in costa rica  guatemala  chile  kenya  jordan and greece and for our distribution and fresh cut facilities in saudi arabia  north america and the united kingdom

we generated cash from operations of million in and had million available under our credit facility as of december  the fair value of our derivatives decreased from a net asset of million as of january  to a net liability of million as of december   related to our foreign currency and bunker fuel cash flow hedges 
for foreign currency hedges  these fluctuations are primarily driven by the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar compared to the euro  british pound and japanese yen currencies being hedged relative to the contracted exchange rates 
for bunker fuel hedges  these fluctuations are driven by the increase or decrease in bunker fuel prices relative to the contracted bunker fuel price 
during  we predominately entered into derivative contracts to hedge the british pound  euro and japanese yen  as well as to hedge bunker fuel prices 
the change in was primarily related to the weakening of the us dollar compared to the japanese yen relative to the contracted hedge position coupled with the fact that the bunker fuel derivatives fully settled in of which the settlement resulted in a realized gain of million  which impacted our cost of products sold 
we enter into derivative instruments with counterparties that are highly rated and do not expect a deterioration of our counterparty s credit rating  however  the deterioration of our counterparty s credit would affect the consolidated financial statements in the recognition of the fair value of the hedges that would be transferred to earnings as the contracts settle 
we expect that net losses of million and million of the fair value of hedges will be transferred to earnings in and along with the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions 
other we are involved in several legal and environmental matters that  if not resolved in our favor  could require significant cash outlays and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity
