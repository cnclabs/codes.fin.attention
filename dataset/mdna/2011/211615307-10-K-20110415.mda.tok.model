item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations references to a note are to the notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
table of contents company overview as discussed in item business  the company operates primarily in two industry groups  hvac and construction products 
within each of these two industry groups  the company has identified two reportable segments the heating and cooling segment and the evaporative cooling segment in the hvac industry group and the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment and the door segment in the construction products industry group 
the heating and cooling segment produces and sells gas fired wall furnaces  console heaters and fan coils from the company s wholly owned subsidiary  wfc of colton  california 
the evaporative cooling segment produces and sells evaporative coolers from the company s wholly owned subsidiary  pmi of phoenix  arizona 
sales of these two segments are nationwide  but are concentrated in the southwestern united states 
concrete  aggregates and construction supplies are offered from numerous locations along the southern front range of colorado operated by the company s wholly owned subsidiaries collectively referred to as tmc 
the company sold its concrete operations in the denver market  rmrm on july  the operations of rmrm are reported as discontinued operations for both of the reported years 
doors are fabricated and sold along with the related hardware from colorado springs and pueblo through the company s wholly owned subsidiary  mdhi of pueblo  colorado 
sales of these two segments are highly concentrated in the front range area in colorado although door sales are also made throughout the united states 
sales of all four segments are affected by the level of construction activity in the areas served and general economic conditions  however sales of furnaces and evaporative coolers are less affected by the level of construction activity as a large portion of their sales are for replacements 
weather conditions in the areas served also affect sales 
sales in all four segments were affected by these factors in both and in addition to the above reporting segments  an unallocated corporate classification is used to report the unallocated expenses of the corporate office which provides treasury  insurance and tax services as well as strategic business planning and general management services and an other classification is used to report a real estate operation 
expenses related to the corporate information technology group are allocated to all locations  including the corporate office 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operations in was  despite a net loss of  the positive cash flow in is reflective of depreciation and amortization charges of  the reduced cash flow as compared to that generated in was due to the reduction of working capital during as discussed below 
net working capital items increased in spite of the recovery of  of prior years federal income taxes resulting from the carryback of the company s net operating loss 
accounts receivable increased by  due to higher sales in the fourth quarter of compared to the comparable quarter 
cash provided from operations in was  despite a net loss of  the principal source of cash flow from operations was a reduction in net working capital 
inventories were reduced by  in total as all of the company s business segments reduced inventories in response to a weak economy and more specifically lower sales in all but the evaporative cooling segment 
the most significant inventory reduction was in the heating and cooling segment in response to a significant reduction in fan coil demand  a reduced production schedule for furnaces and stronger than expected furnace sales in the fourth quarter of inventories were reduced in that segment by  as a result of the lower sales  accounts receivable decreased by  the accounts receivable and inventory reduction were offset to some extent by a  reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses  which is also reflective of the lower level of sales 
investing activities during used cash of  compared to the  of cash generated from investing activities during the company continued to limit capital expenditures during as sales volume remains depressed 
capital expenditures during included  for the buyout of three leased loaders in the cacs segment 
the remaining expenditures were primarily for routine replacement or refurbishing of equipment in all of the segments 
investing activities in generated a net positive cash flow of  cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment were  including  received from the sale of a portion of the company s sand property in colorado springs see discussion under results of operations 
the company also sold its denver based ready mix business  rmrm in july for total consideration of  cash of  and a note receivable of  were received at the closing 
after deducting  cash retained by rmrm at the time of the closing the net cash proceeds from the sale were  capital expenditures in were  primarily in the cacs segment including  to purchase two aggregates plants that were previously leased   to complete the slurry wall associated with the new mining phase at the pueblo aggregates operation   to purchase mixer trucks that were previously leased and  for the land movement monitoring system for the pikeview quarry 
the door segment spent  in for a new roof for its colorado springs fabrication and office facility 

table of contents during  financing activities used  to reduce long term debt by  including  of scheduled principal repayments  and pay  against the revolving bank loan 
during  net cash used in financing activities was  funded debt  consisting of long term debt and a revolving bank loan  was reduced by a total of  long term debt was reduced by  including scheduled principal repayments of  in addition  of the proceeds from the sale of rmrm and the colorado springs sand property were used to pay down the long term debt 
the remaining  reduction in long term debt was paid at the time of the april  refinancing with proceeds from the revolving bank loan 
the revolving bank loan was reduced by  including the  borrowed to pay down the long term debt 
in the company deposited cash of  with its casualty insurer to secure self insured claims under its casualty insurance program 
previously  these claims were secured by a bank letter of credit 
the company paid  in financing fees and other expenses associated with the refinancing 
budgeted capital spending for is approximately  projected depreciation  depletion and amortization are approximately  planned capital expenditures in the cacs segment include conveyer belts for the pueblo aggregates operation and retrofitting certain equipment for use in the pikeview quarry expected to be reopened during capital expenditures in the other three segments include various production equipment  tooling and dies 
the company expects to fund the planned capital expenditures from operating cash flow or funds available from the revolving credit facility 
sales of the company s hvac products are seasonal except for fan coils 
sales of furnaces  heaters and evaporative coolers are sensitive to weather conditions particularly during the peak selling season 
fan coil sales are  to a significant extent  dependent on commercial construction  particularly for hotels 
revenues in the cacs segment are primarily dependent on the level of construction activity along the front range in southern colorado 
the level of construction activity over the past two years has been depressed due to the economic downturn  tighter credit markets and large quantity of repossessed homes for sale 
this situation has prevailed throughout most of the united states 
price competition tends to intensify in this segment when demand is weak 
inclement weather during the winter months in southern colorado can result in significantly reduced sales in those months even under robust economic conditions 
sales for the door segment are not as seasonal nor are they much affected by weather conditions 
historically  the company has experienced operating losses during the first quarter except when the weather is mild and demand strong along the front range 
operating results typically improve in the second and third quarters reflecting more favorable weather conditions in southern colorado and the seasonal sales of the evaporative cooling segment 
fourth quarter results can vary based on weather conditions in colorado as well as in the principal markets for the company s heating equipment 
the company typically experiences operating cash flow deficits during the first half of the year reflecting operating results  the use of sales dating programs extended payment terms related to the evaporative cooling segment and payments of the prior year s accrued incentive bonuses and company profit sharing contributions  if any 
as a result  the company s borrowings against its revolving credit facility tend to peak during the second quarter and then decline over the remainder of the year 
revolving credit and term loan agreement on april   the company entered into a secured credit agreement credit agreement under which the bank lender initially provided a total credit facility of  consisting of a  revolving credit facility with credit availability reduced by letters of credit that may be issued by the lender on the company s behalf and a  term loan 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by the company s accounts receivable  inventories  machinery  equipment  vehicles  certain real estate and the common stock of all of the company s subsidiaries 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are limited to of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventories 
effective april   inventory borrowings are limited to a maximum of  borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest based on a london interbank offer rate libor or prime rate based option 
under the prior three amendments to the credit agreement amended credit agreement  the interest rate is over libor but with a libor floor of the company s effective libor borrowing rate is currently 
the prime rate option is over prime but with a prime floor of the company s current effective borrowing rate is 
the amended credit agreement also reduced the credit available under the revolving credit facility line to  however  the maturity date of the credit facility was extended to december  the amended credit agreement requires the company to maintain certain levels of tangible net worth  achieve minimum adjusted quarterly ebitda earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization and limits the amount of annual capital expenditures 
additional borrowings  acquisition of stock of other companies  purchase of treasury shares and payment of cash dividends are either limited or require prior approval by the lender 
payment of accrued interest is due monthly or at the end of the applicable libor period on both the revolving credit borrowings and the term debt borrowings 
principal payments under the term loan are due quarterly with a final payment of all remaining unpaid principal at the maturity date 
outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility as of january  were  the highest balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility during was  average outstanding revolving credit during the year was  the 
table of contents weighted average interest rates on the outstanding revolving credit and term debt in and were and  respectively  including the effect of the interest rate swap discussed below 
at all times since the inception of the credit agreement  the company had sufficient qualifying and eligible assets such that the maximum revolving credit facility was immediately available and is expected to be available for the foreseeable future 
the lender required the company to enter into an interest rate swap transaction to hedge the interest rate on  of term debt 
on may  the company entered into an interest rate swap transaction for a notional amount of  whereby the company pays a fixed rate of on  and receives a floating rate equivalent to the day libor rate but not less than 
since the inception of this agreement the day libor rate has remained below 
hence  the effect of the transaction has been  thus far  to increase the company s effective interest rate on  of its outstanding term debt by 
the notional amount decreases as follows september  december  march  the interest rate swap transaction terminates on april  in april the company deposited cash of  with its casualty insurance carrier to serve as collateral for the self insured obligations under the company s casualty insurance program 
this deposit was funded with borrowings under the revolving credit line 
previously these obligations were secured by a bank letter of credit 
the company was in compliance with all covenants of the amended credit agreement at january  the company obtained a fifth amendment to the credit agreement effective april  in order to extend the maturity date of the revolving credit and to amend other terms 
the fifth amendment provides for the following the company must maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of tested quarterly on a trailing twelve months basis commencing with the fiscal quarter ending july  the company must maintain a minimum tangible net worth of  plus of future net income 
at january   the company s tangible net worth  as defined  was  annual capital expenditures may not exceed  the maximum revolving credit facility line will remain at  until january   when it will be reduced to the maturity date of the credit facility is extended to may  a performance based interest rate pricing grid has been added based upon the leverage ratio achieved 
the libor borrowing rate ranges from to over libor  with a libor floor of 
the prime or base borrowing rate ranges from to over the prime rate  with a prime rate floor of 
the interest rate swap transaction will remain in effect as described above 
the term loan principal repayment schedule is revised 
see note for the amended schedule 
the company has entered into an agreement to distribute a product currently being developed by a third party 
should the product be successfully developed such that it results in a commercially salable product  the company  through a newly formed subsidiary  is likely to incur start up costs and other expenses prior to the realization of revenues by this new business venture 
should such expenses cause the company to fail to meet the fixed charge ratio noted above  the fifth amendment allows the company to cure such default by obtaining unsecured subordinated loans and to include the amount of such subordinated loans fixed charge cure amount in the calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio 
definitions under the credit agreement as amended are as follows tangible net worth is defined as net worth plus subordinated debt minus intangible assets goodwill  intellectual property  prepaid expenses and deferred charges minus all obligations owed to the company or any of its subsidiaries by any affiliate or any or its subsidiaries and minus all loans owed by its officers  stockholders  subsidiaries or employees note there are no loans owed by any of the referenced parties at january  or as of the date of this filing except for a loan of  to an officer of one of the company s subsidiaries made subsequent to the end of fiscal 
adjusted ebitda is defined as net income plus interest  income taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization plus other non cash charges approved by the lender 
fixed charge coverage ratio is defined as  for any computation period  the ratio of a the sum for such period of i adjusted ebitda  plus ii the aggregate fixed charge cure amount  if any  with respect to any quarterly period during such computation period  minus iii the sum of income taxes paid in cash by the loan parties excluding the aggregate amount of federal income taxes paid during such computation period with respect to the amended federal income tax return and the resultant amendment to the carryback of the company s net operating loss to the extent such amount 
table of contents does not exceed  in the aggregate  and all unfinanced capital expenditures to b the sum of scheduled principal payments of the term debt 
the company has prepared a projection of cash sources and uses for the next months 
under this projection  the company believes that its existing cash balance  anticipated cash flow from operations and borrowings available under the credit agreement  will be sufficient to cover expected cash needs  including servicing debt and planned capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
the company also expects to be in compliance with all debt covenants  as amended  during this period or  in the event of a default related to the fixed charge coverage ratio resulting from the new venture  discussed above  the company believes it will be able to obtain unsecured subordinated debt sufficient in amount to cure the default  if any  as provided for in the fifth amendment 
reconciliation of fair value of reporting units to market capitalization the company estimates that the aggregate fair value of its four reporting units as of january  is approximately  the fair value of the cacs reporting unit was determined as described in the critical accounting policies discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets below 
the fair value of all other reporting units was estimated by management based on a discounted cash flow valuation using a discount rate in all cases 
after deducting all outstanding funded debt  which totaled  as of january   the calculation yields a net fair value of the equity of the reporting units of  the company s market capitalization as of january  was approximately  based on a december  share price of and  common shares outstanding 
it is the company s opinion that its share price reflects the negative impact of its corporate office expenses as many of these would not be required to operate the individual companies 
it is also the company s opinion that the value of its operating businesses is not diminished as a result of the corporate expenses 
therefore  in the company s opinion  in reconciling the fair value of the operating units to the market capitalization an adjustment to the market capitalization for the corporate expenses is appropriate 
using the five year average corporate office expenses after the related income tax benefit and applying a capitalization rate results in an adjusted market capitalization of  as of january  in the company s opinion  the difference between the net fair value of the reporting units and the adjusted market capitalization represents the value of the control premium 
as of january  the control premium is approximately of the adjusted market capitalization 
the company believes this level of control premium is reasonable and falls within a range based upon actual control premiums involving merger transactions of companies in the sic codes under which we operate 
a reconciliation of the fair value of the reporting units to the adjusted market capitalization is shown in the table below 
amounts are in thousands except share data 
market capitalization market capitalization based on based on the lowest january  year to date closing price closing price of per share per share estimated fair value of reporting units less outstanding funded debt as of and net fair value of reporting units market capitalization  and  common shares outstanding adjustment for corporate expenses after income tax effect adjusted market capitalization control premium fair value of reporting units as determined above control premium as a percentage of adjusted market capitalization a significant portion of the company s common stock is closely held 
the three largest shareholders and other officers and directors together own approximately of the outstanding shares 
the remaining shares available float represent only of the outstanding shares 
generally  there is limited trading activity in the company s shares 
on some trading days there is no trading activity 
the company s share price is subject to sharp volatility on trades of a few hundred shares or less 
for these reasons  it is the opinion of the company that its market capitalization at any given time is not indicative of the aggregate fair value of the reporting units 

table of contents insurance policies the company maintained insurance policies since march  with the following per incident deductibles and policy limits per occurrence policy aggregate deductible limits limits product liability general liability workers compensation statutory auto and truck liability no limit should the aggregate out of pocket payments related to the above policies exceed  during a policy year  deductibles on future claims are waived and the policies pay all amounts up to the policy limits 
should any  or all policy limits be exceeded  the company maintains an umbrella policy which covers the next  of claims 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements that are likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
results of operations in the ensuing discussions of the results of operations we define the term gross profit as the amount determined by deducting cost of sales before depreciation  depletion and amortization from sales 
the gross profit ratio is gross profit divided by sales 
discussion of consolidated results from continuing operations vs 
consolidated sales in were  an increase of less than compared to sales at three of the company s four business segments were lower in only the heating and cooling segment realized an increase in sales 
a continuing depressed level of construction in southern colorado resulted in lower sales at both the both business segments within the construction products group 
the loss of a national retail account and some carryover of inventory at some customers from the previous season lead to lower sales for the evaporative cooling segment 
the consolidated gross profit ratio in was  an increase of a full percentage points compared to for as seen throughout most of the year the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies cacs and the heating and cooling segment achieved an improvement in their gross profit ratio compared though to unusually low levels realized in the company s other two business segments experienced lower gross profit ratios due to increased raw material costs  lower production volumes or competitive pricing pressures 
consolidated selling and administrative expenses were  higher in as a percentage of consolidated sales these expenses were compared to in the prior year 
consolidated selling and administrative expenses would have been lower in absent higher legal expenses in the heating and cooling and cacs segment 
the operating profit for was  compared to an operating loss of  in however  of significance is that the operating result for included a  gain on the sale of a portion of the company s sand property in colorado springs 
in gains from the sale of property and equipment were only  net interest expense in was  compared to  in including  of interest expense attributable to the discontinued operation 
higher interest rates under the current credit agreement largely offset a reduction in average outstanding funded debt 
in  the weighted average interest rate on outstanding funded debt was approximately compared to in including the interest of the discontinued operation 
average outstanding funded debt in was  compared to  in the reduction in outstanding indebtedness was due principally to reduced capital spending  proceeds from the sale of rmrm in july and a reduction in working capital 
the company s effective income tax rate reflects federal and state statutory income tax rates adjusted for non deductible expenses  tax credits and other tax items 
the effective income tax rate related to the loss from continuing operations in was a benefit of compared to a benefit of related to the loss from continuing operations 

table of contents in november  the company filed a lawsuit against an insurance company with regard to a business interruption claim resulting from an incident that lead to the cessation of operations at the pikeview quarry in december of the litigation is currently in the discovery process 
no recovery has been anticipated or recorded in the company s financial statements 
the company operates four businesses in two industry groups 
the businesses are seasonal  weather sensitive and subject to cyclical factors 
the following addresses various aspects of operating performance focusing on the reportable segments within each of the two industry groups 
construction products industry group the table below presents a summary of operating information for the two reportable segments within the construction products industry group for the fiscal years and amounts in thousands 
concrete  aggregates and construction supplies door revenues from external customers segment gross profit gross profit as percent of sales segment operating loss income operating loss income as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets revenues from external customers segment gross profit gross profit as percent of sales segment operating loss income operating loss income as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment vs 
sales in the cacs segment fell by  due to the continuing weak construction market 
housing starts in the served market area remained at or near record lows 
the preponderance of the shipments in was to industrial  military or other publicly financed construction projects 
ready mix concrete volume in was virtually the same as in the average price of ready mix concrete fell by reflecting a more intense level of competition  lower cement costs and a change in product mix 
the gross profit per cubic yard declined by cents as lower cement prices helped to offset most of the effect of the lower selling prices 
sales of aggregates sand  crushed limestone and gravel  including internal consumption  were slightly higher in compared to though both years were ones of very low volume 
the combined gross profit from all aggregate operations in was  compared to a gross profit of  in higher sand production volume  including industrial sands  increased production capability at the black canyon limestone quarry  improved operating efficiency at the pueblo gravel operation and reduced costs at the idle pikeview quarry all contributed to the enhanced gross profit 
selling and administrative expenses were reduced by  as the result of compensation and employee benefit reductions and reduced provisions for uncollectable accounts 
the prices of two commodities  cement and diesel fuel  can have a significant effect on the results of operations of this segment 
the company negotiates cement prices with producers who have production facilities in or near the concrete markets that we serve 
the company may negotiate separate cement prices for large construction projects depending on the demand for and availability of cement from the local producers 
the company buys diesel fuel from local distributors 
it may from time to time enter into a short term arrangement with a distributor whereby the price of diesel fuel is fixed for a period of up to six months 
the company does not otherwise hedge diesel fuel prices 
changes in the cost of these two commodities have a direct effect on the results of operations depending upon whether competitive conditions prevailing in the marketplace enable the company to adjust its selling prices to recover the increased costs 

table of contents door segment vs 
door sales in were  less than the previous year 
the decline in sales is related to the weak construction market particularly within the state of colorado 
the lower sales volume and more competitive bidding environment resulted in a decrease in gross profit ratio by one full percentage point 
the door segment sales backlog at the end of was approximately  compared to approximately  at the end of hvac industry group the table below presents a summary of operating information for the two reportable segments within the hvac industry group for the fiscal years and amounts in thousands 
heating and cooling evaporative cooling revenues from external customers segment gross profit gross profit as percent of sales segment operating income operating income as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets revenues from external customers segment gross profit gross profit as percent of sales segment operating loss income operating loss income as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets heating and cooling segment vs 
sales in the heating and cooling segment increased by  compared to sales of furnaces and heaters were higher in cooler weather in april and may in the principal market areas extended the heating season and contributed to the higher sales 
a higher finished goods inventory level and better product availability entering the heating season resulted in a stronger furnace and heater sales in the last four months of the fan coil market was moderately stronger in compared to  when construction projects were deferred or suspended due to the uncertainty of the economy or financing markets 
the segment s gross profit ratio improved from in to in principally due to the increased furnace production level and some improvement in manufacturing operations 
selling and administrative expenses in were approximately  higher than the previous year 
the increased sales  additional sales incentives for key furnace customers and increased legal expenses related to some employment matters and product liability claims were the principal contributors to the increased selling and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of sales such expenses were in  compared to in evaporative cooling segment vs 
sales of evaporative coolers decreased by approximately in compared to the prior year 
the loss of a national retail account and a carryover of inventory at some customers from the previous season were the principal reasons for the lower sales 
the gross profit ratio in was compared to in the lower ratio was the result of the lower sales and production volume and steel price increases experienced in the latter part of a beneficial change in product mix offset some of the impact of the lower volume and higher steel costs 
selling and administrative expenses were approximately  lower in 
table of contents principally due to reduced commissions and cooperative advertising allowances both of which vary with sales volume 
as a percentage of sales these expenses were and in and  respectively 
both businesses in the hvac group are sensitive to changes in prices for a number of different raw materials  commodities and purchased parts 
prices of steel and copper in particular can have a significant effect on the results of operations of this group 
we are not currently a party to any hedging arrangements with regard to copper or steel 
outlook overall the company expects sales in to be approximately the same as the construction market along the front range in southern colorado is not expected to substantially improve in the coming year 
the company believes that price competition will remain sharp in the construction products industry group as it typically does when the construction market is slow 
we expect cement prices to increase and fuel prices to remain at the current high level 
in order to prevent our profit margins from deteriorating further we plan on increasing the prices we charge for ready mix concrete in the second quarter of the company continues to work on a mining and reclamation plan to reopen the pikeview quarry 
the plan requires the approval of the department of natural resources of the state of colorado 
if such approval is obtained  and there is no assurance that it will be obtained  the company anticipates resuming operations at the pikeview quarry in we estimate that approximately  of capital spending will be required to recommence operations at pikeview 
we are unable to predict the outcome of the litigation with regard to the pikeview quarry business interruption claim sales in the hvac industry group are also expected to be essentially unchanged from hotel construction is expected to remain at a low level 
this will be a negative influence on fan coil sales 
sales of furnaces  heaters and evaporative coolers are primarily for replacement purposes and therefore are not reliant on new construction 
however  a continuing high level of unemployment could reduce demand for these products 
sales of furnaces and evaporative coolers are influenced by weather conditions particularly during the usual selling season 
overall capital spending in is expected to be approximately  including the equipment required for the planned reopening of the pikeview quarry 
critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission requires all registrants  including the company  to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies and methods 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company annually assesses goodwill for potential impairment as of the last day of its fiscal year 
in addition  to the extent that events occur  either involving the relevant reporting unit or in their industries  the company revisits its assessment of the recorded goodwill to determine if impairment has occurred and should be recognized 
as of january   the company has recorded  of goodwill consisting of  related to the cacs reporting unit and  related to the door reporting unit 
in the company charged  against earnings from discontinued operations representing the allocable portion of goodwill related to rmrm which was sold in july for purposes of measuring the fair value of the cacs reporting unit the company engages the services of an independent investment banking firm 
the fair value of this reporting unit is determined by applying three valuation methods 
these are discounted cash flow dcf valuation  an analysis of comparable transactions within the industry and comparable enterprise valuations of other public companies in the industry 
the dcf valuation involves projecting future cash flows 
the cash flow projection entails key assumptions with regard to unit sales volumes  gross profit rate per unit or per sales dollar  capital expenditures and the discount rate 
the cash flow projection assumes a gradual recovery in construction activity along the front range in southern colorado  the reporting unit s principal market area 
however  projected unit volumes do not reach levels achieved in this reporting unit during the peak of the previous business cycle 
the projections assume that the company will resume operations at the pikeview quarry in or will be able to increase production at its other aggregate operations 
the cash flow projections assume some increase in gross profit rates compared to current levels due to an increase in volume  an improvement in the relationship of selling prices for concrete relative to cement unit costs and some cost reductions 
the projected gross profit rates do not exceed levels previously attained 
projected capital expenditures are compatible with the projected unit sales volume 
the cash flow forecasts are adjusted by a discount rate that takes into consideration both the time value of money and the investment risk 
the valuation of the cacs segment  assuming discount rates ranging between and  approximates million to million 
the independent investment banking firm concluded that there were very few transaction consummated during that could be viewed as comparable to the cacs segment 

table of contents currently  as a result of rapidly deteriorating ebitda earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization within the construction materials industry  many industry analysts are now applying multiples of mid cycle or average ebitda in valuing transactions 
cacs s year average ebitda mid cycle is million 
while historic ebitda multiples suggest that the year average is times ebitda  the industry multiples more often seen applied to mid cycle ebitda is times to times 
when applying this ebitda multiple to the cacs mid cycle ebitda  the calculated value is between million to million 
the comparison to other publicly traded construction materials companies that are comparable to cacs a total of six companies were identified had total enterprise values expressed as a multiple of ebitda ranging from times to times as of december  the average ebitda multiple was times and the median ebitda multiple was times 
the comparison of public companies methodology results in a valuation of cacs of million to million 
the fair value of the door reporting unit is estimated by the company based on its own discounted cash flow dcf projection 
the cash flow projection involves key assumptions regarding sales  costs  expenses and capital expenditures 
management believes that the projections are reasonable and the projected cash flows approximate prior experience 
the discount rate used to determine the dcf valuation as of january  was 
the estimated fair value based on the discounted cash flow projection indicates a fair value for the reporting unit that exceeds the carrying value of the net assets in the reporting unit by management believes that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values are reasonable  however  a prolonged period of depressed construction activity along the front range in southern colorado  inability to resume production at the pikeview quarry  inability to increase production at the company s other aggregate operations or changes in the aforementioned assumptions and estimates  as well as the effects of unpredictable future events or circumstances could materially affect the estimated fair value 
long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets the company reviews long lived assets by asset group for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
determining whether impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions  including determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset  the amount and useful life over which cash flows will occur and the asset s residual value  if any 
in turn  measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value  which is based on the best information available given the company s historical experience and internal business plans 
the company has determined that there was no impairment of such long lived assets in liabilities the company purchases insurance coverage for workers compensation  general product and automobile liability  retaining certain levels of risk self insured portion 
see the above section titled insurance policies for information related to per incident deductibles and policy limits 
provision for workers compensation claims is estimated by management based on information provided by the independent third party administrator and periodic review of all outstanding claims 
the company s independent claims administrator tracks all claims and assigns a liability to each individual claim based upon facts known at the time of estimation 
in addition  management periodically reviews each individual claim with both the third party claims administrator and legal counsel and the third party administrator revises the estimated liability accordingly 
the company also retains an independent expert who applies actuarial methodology to the claims data provided by the company s independent claims administrator to estimate the ultimate aggregate settlement amount of the claims using specific loss development factors based on the company s prior experience 
the company then establishes its reserve for workers compensation claims based upon the actuarial evaluation and management s knowledge of the outstanding claims 
management tracks changes to the incurred and paid amounts of individual workers compensation claims up to the date of final closure 
in recent years  the net amounts that the claims have ultimately settled for have indicated that the reserve recorded by the company has been sufficient 
with regard to product liability  provisions for both claims and unasserted claims that would be covered under the self insured portion of the policies are reviewed at least annually and are recorded in accordance with accounting guidance on contingent liabilities provided in the fasb accounting standards codification codification 
management also incorporates information from discussions with legal counsel handling the individual claims when revising its estimates 
provision for automobile claims is estimated based upon information provided by the company s independent claims administrator and the company s own experience 
the number of automobile claims and the amounts involved are not material 
historically  there have not been many instances of significant variances between actual final settlements and our estimates regarding automobile and product liability claims 
the company maintains a reserve for future reclamation work to be performed at its various aggregate operations based upon an estimate of the total expense that will be incurred to reclaim the disturbed areas 
actual reclamation costs are charged to expense 
the adequacy of the recorded reserve is assessed annually 
the assessment may be done more frequently if events or circumstances arise that may indicate a change in estimated costs  recoverable material or the period of mining activity 
for the annual assessment of the 
table of contents reserve  company engages an independent professional to assist in reevaluating the estimates of both the quantities of recoverable material and the cost of reclamation 
our assessment of the adequacy of the reclamation reserves is based on management s assumptions with the assistance of the independent professional 
the analysis requires the use of significant assumptions and estimates about the mining plans  homogeneity of the deposits  third party costs to perform work  method of reclamation to be used  etc 
management believes that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the reserve are reasonable  however  changes in the aforementioned assumptions and estimates  as well as the effects of unknown future events or circumstances  including legislative requirements  could materially affect estimated costs  the quantities of recoverable material or the period of mining 
depletion of rock and sand deposits and amortization of deferred development costs are computed by the units of production method based upon estimated recoverable quantities of rock and sand 
sales the company recognizes revenue as products are shipped to customers 
sales are recorded net of estimates of applicable provisions for discounts  volume incentives  returns and allowances based upon current program terms and historical experience 
at the time of revenue recognition  the company also provides an estimate of potential bad debt and warranty expense as well as an amount anticipated to be granted to customers under cooperative advertising programs based upon current program terms and historical experience 
additionally  the hvac companies offer discounts for early payment of amounts due under dating and other extended payment programs
