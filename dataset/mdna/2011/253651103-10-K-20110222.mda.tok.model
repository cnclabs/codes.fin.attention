additionally  the company entered into a derivative transaction to hedge interest rate risk on  of the senior notes  which was treated as a cash flow hedge 
this reduced the effective interest rate by basis points from to percent 
the company s financing agreements contain various restrictive financial covenants  including net debt to capitalization and net interest coverage ratios 
as of december   the company was in compliance with the financial covenants in its debt agreements 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not participate in transactions that facilitate off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events 
these estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported  disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
such estimates include the value of purchase consideration  valuation of trade receivables  inventories  goodwill  intangible assets  other long lived assets  legal contingencies  guarantee obligations  indemnifications and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes  pension and postretirement benefits and customer incentives  among others 
these estimates and assumptions are based on management s best estimates and judgment 
management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors  including the current economic difficulties in the united states credit markets and the global markets 
management monitors the economic conditions and other factors and will adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate 
illiquid credit markets  volatile foreign currency and equity  and declines in the global economic environment have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions 
as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision  actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
changes in those estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that  of its significant accounting policies  its policies concerning revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  goodwill  taxes on income and pensions and postretirement benefits are the most critical because they are affected significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates 
additional information regarding these policies is included below 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as of december  continued unaudited dollars in thousands  except per share amounts revenue recognition in general  the company records revenue when it is realized  or realizable and earned 
in contracts that involve multiple deliverables  which can include products  services and or software  revenue recognized for each deliverable is based upon the relative selling prices of each deliverable 
the company determines the selling price of deliverables within a multiple deliverable arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe price when sold on stand alone basis or the estimated selling price where vsoe is not established for undelivered items 
total arrangement consideration is allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method  which allocates any discount in the arrangement proportionately to each deliverable on the basis of each deliverable s selling price 
there have been no material changes to these estimates for the periods presented and the company believes that these estimates generally should not be subject to significant changes in the future 
however  changes to deliverables in future arrangements could materially impact the amount of earned or deferred revenue 
in contracts that involve software and service deliverables  amounts deferred for software support are based upon vsoe of the value of the deliverables  which requires judgment about whether the deliverables can be divided into more than one unit of accounting and whether the separate units of accounting have value to the customer on a stand alone basis 
there have been no material changes to these deliverables for the periods presented 
however  changes to deliverables in future arrangements and the ability to establish vsoe could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for potential credit losses  and such losses have been minimal and within management s expectations 
since the company s receivable balance is concentrated primarily in the financial and government sectors  an economic downturn in these sectors could result in higher than expected credit losses 
the concentration of credit risk in the company s trade receivables with respect to financial and government customers is largely mitigated by the company s credit evaluation process and the geographical dispersion of sales transactions from a large number of individual customers 
inventory reserves at each reporting period  the company identifies and writes down its excess and obsolete inventory to its net realizable value based on forecasted usage  orders and inventory aging 
with the development of new products  the company also rationalizes its product offerings and will write down discontinued product to the lower of cost or net realizable value 
goodwill the company tests all existing goodwill at least annually for impairment using the fair value approach on a reporting unit basis 
the company s reporting units are defined as domestic and canada  brazil  latin america  asia pacific  and emea 
the company uses the discounted cash flow method and the guideline company method for determining the fair value of its reporting units 
the determination of implied fair value of the goodwill for a particular reporting unit is the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities  which is the same manner as the allocation in a business combination 
implied fair value goodwill is determined as the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of its assets and liabilities 
the company uses the most current information available and performs the annual impairment analysis as of november each year 
however  actual circumstances could differ significantly from assumptions and estimates made and could result in future goodwill impairment 
the company tests for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the carrying value of a reporting unit below its reported amount 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment based on a two step test 
in the first step  the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its net book value 
the fair value is determined based upon discounted estimated future cash flows as well as the market approach or guideline public company method 
the company s step impairment test of goodwill of a reporting unit is based upon the fair value of the reporting unit  defined as the price that would be received to sell the net assets or transfer the net liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the assessment date november 
in the event that the net carrying amount exceeds the fair value  a step test must be performed whereby the fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill must be estimated to determine if it is less than its net carrying amount 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as of december  continued unaudited dollars in thousands  except per share amounts the valuation techniques used in the step impairment test and  if necessary  step impairment test have incorporated a number of assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable and to reflect forecasted market conditions at the assessment date 
assumptions in estimating future cash flows are subject to a high degree of judgment 
the company makes all efforts to forecast future cash flows as accurately as possible with the information available at the time a forecast is made 
to this end  the company evaluates the appropriateness of its assumptions as well as its overall forecasts by comparing projected results of upcoming years with actual results of preceding years and validating that differences therein are reasonable 
key assumptions relate to price trends  material costs  discount rate  customer demand  and the long term growth and foreign exchange rates 
a number of benchmarks from independent industry and other economic publications were also used 
changes in assumptions and estimates after the assessment date may lead to an outcome where impairment charges would be required in future periods 
specifically  actual results may vary from the company s forecasts and such variations may be material and unfavorable  thereby triggering the need for future impairment tests where the conclusions may differ in reflection of prevailing market conditions 
management concluded during the company s annual goodwill impairment test for that of the company s goodwill within the emea reporting unit was fully impaired and the company recorded a  non cash impairment charge during the fourth quarter 
due to the operational challenges experienced in the emea region over the past few quarters and the negative business impact related to potential fcpa compliance issues within the region  management has reduced its near term earnings outlook for the emea business unit  resulting in the goodwill impairment 
the annual goodwill impairment tests for and resulted in no impairment in any of the company s reporting units 
the valuation techniques used in the impairment tests incorporate a number of estimates and assumptions that are subject to change  although the company believes these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and reflect forecasted market conditions at the assessment date 
any changes to these assumptions and estimates due to market conditions or otherwise  may lead to an outcome where impairment charges would be required in future periods 
because actual results may vary from our forecasts and such variations may be material and unfavorable  the company may need to record future impairment charges with respect to the goodwill attributed to any reporting unit 
taxes on income deferred taxes are provided on an asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences  operating loss carry forwards and tax credits 
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
the company operates in numerous taxing jurisdictions and is subject to examination by various us  federal  state and foreign jurisdictions for various tax periods 
additionally  the company has retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in connection with various divestitures of businesses 
the company s income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which the company does business 
due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction  the differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions  as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters  the company s estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments 
the company regularly assesses its position with regard to tax exposures and records liabilities for these uncertain tax positions and related interest and penalties  if any  according to the principles of accounting standards codification asc the company has recorded an accrual that reflects the recognition and measurement process for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
additional future income tax expense or benefit may be recognized once the positions are effectively settled 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as of december  continued unaudited dollars in thousands  except per share amounts at the end of each interim reporting period  the company estimates the effective tax rate expected to apply to the full fiscal year 
the estimated effective tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned  as well as tax planning strategies 
current and projected growth in income in higher tax jurisdictions may result in an increasing effective tax rate over time 
if the actual results differ from estimates  the company may adjust the effective tax rate in the interim period if such determination is made 
pensions and postretirement benefits annual net periodic expense and benefit liabilities under the company s defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis 
assumptions used in the actuarial calculations have a significant impact on plan obligations and expense 
annually  management and the investment committee of the board of directors review the actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to the assumptions  if warranted 
the discount rate is determined by analyzing the average return of high quality ie  aa rated fixed income investments and the year over year comparison of certain widely used benchmark indices as of the measurement date 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is determined using the plans current asset allocation and their expected rates of return based on a geometric averaging over years 
the rate of compensation increase assumptions reflects the company s long term actual experience and future and near term outlook 
pension benefits are funded through deposits with trustees 
postretirement benefits are not funded and the company s policy is to pay these benefits as they become due 
the following table represents assumed health care cost trend rates at december healthcare cost trend rate assumed for next year rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline the ultimate trend rate year that rate reaches ultimate trend rate the healthcare trend rates are reviewed based upon the results of actual claims experience 
the company used healthcare cost trends of and percent in and  respectively  decreasing to an ultimate trend of percent in for both medical and prescription drug benefits using the society of actuaries long term trend model with assumptions based on the medicare trustees projections 
assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the healthcare plans 
a one percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects one percentage one percentage point increase point decrease effect on total of service and interest cost effect on postretirement benefit obligation recently issued accounting guidance with the exception of those stated below  there have been no recent accounting guidance or changes in accounting guidance during the year ended december   as compared to the recent accounting guidance described in the annual report on form k as of december  that are of material significance  or have potential material significance 
refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for accounting guidance adopted during the year ended december  in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts asu 
asu clarifies the requirement to test for impairment of goodwill 
asc topic has required that goodwill be tested for impairment if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
under asu 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as of december  continued unaudited dollars in thousands  except per share amounts  when the carrying amount of a reporting unit is zero or negative an entity must assume that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  perform an additional test to determine whether goodwill has been impaired and calculate the amount of that impairment 
the modifications to asc topic resulting from the issuance of asu are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those years 
early adoption is not permitted 
the adoption of asu is not expected to have an impact on the financial statements of the company

risk factors 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in thousands the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its international operations denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
a hypothetical percent movement in the applicable foreign exchange rates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in and year to date operating profit of approximately  and  respectively 
the sensitivity model assumes an instantaneous  parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates 
exchange rates rarely move in the same direction 
the assumption that exchange rates change in an instantaneous or parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on amounts denominated in a foreign currency 
the company s risk management strategy uses derivative financial instruments such as forwards to hedge certain foreign currency exposures 
the intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures  with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging these exposures 
the company does not enter into derivatives for trading purposes 
the company s primary exposures to foreign exchange risk are movements in the euro usdollar  british pound usdollar and pound us dollar swiss franc 
there were no significant changes in the company s foreign exchange risks in compared with the company s venezuelan operations consist of a fifty percent owned subsidiary  which is consolidated 
on january   the venezuelan government announced the devaluation of its currency  the bolivar  and the establishment of a two tier exchange structure 
subsequently  during may  the venezuelan government seized control of the parallel market  thereby creating a new government controlled rate 
transitioning from the parallel rate to the new government controlled rate did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in the future  if the company converts bolivares at a rate other than the new government controlled rate  the company may realize additional gains or losses that would be recorded in the statement of income 
the company manages interest rate risk with the use of variable rate borrowings under its committed and uncommitted credit facilities and interest rate swaps 
variable rate borrowings under the credit facilities totaled  and  at december  and  respectively  of which  was effectively converted to fixed rate using interest rate swaps 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in interest expense of approximately  and  for and  respectively  including the impact of the swap agreements 
the company s primary exposure to interest rate risk is movements in the london interbank offered rate libor  which is consistent with prior periods 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company hedged  of the fixed rate borrowings under its private placement agreement  which was treated as a cash flow hedge 
this reduced the effective interest rate by basis points from to percent
