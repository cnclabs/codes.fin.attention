readers are also urged to carefully review and consider our discussions regarding the various factors that affect our business  which are described in this section and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a designer  manufacturer and seller of clean technology plate heat exchangers and related systems in the prc 
our products are used by our customers in the industrial  residential and commercial markets in china to improve energy utilization and efficiencies and reduce pollution by reducing the need for coal fired boilers 
we design  manufacture  sell and service phes  phe units  which combine phes with various pumps  temperature sensors  valves and automated control systems  and heat meters for use in commercial and residential buildings 
we also design  manufacture and sell spiral heat exchangers and tube heat exchangers 
our products and systems are an increasingly important element in providing a clean technology  mission critical solution to energy consumption and air pollution problems in china and are commonly used in a wide variety of industrial processes where heat transfer is required 
common applications include energy conversion for hvac and industrial use in petroleum refining  petrochemicals  metallurgy  food and beverage and chemical processing 
our phe units are custom designed by our own in house engineers and sold under our taiyu brand name  while our phes are sold under both our taiyu brand as well as the sondex brand name 
we are an authorized dealer of sondex phes in china 
we were incorporated in the state of nevada on august   under the name pacific goldrim resources  inc  as an exploration stage corporation that intended to engage in exploration for silver  lead and zinc 
on april   we changed our name to smartheat inc and acquired all of the equity interests in taiyu  a privately held company formed under the laws of the prc engaged in the design  manufacture  sale and servicing of plate heat exchange products in china phe 
after the relevant prc government agency approved our subscription of of the registered capital increase of taiyu on july   prc approval of taiyu becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of smartheat was obtained on june   when the transfer by the three original owners of taiyu of their remaining ownership of taiyu to smartheat was officially recognized 
as an expansion of our business  we acquired sandeke  a shanghai based manufacturer of phes on september  on june   we completed an asset purchase transaction with siping beifang to set up a new manufacturing facility under our newly incorporated subsidiary  smartheat siping 
on august   we formed jinhui  a joint venture in beijing of which we own with total registered capital of rmb million million  to provide consulting services and expand our sales of phes into new industries and regions of china 
on april   we formed smartheat investment  an investment holding company and wholly owned subsidiary in shenyang with registered capital of million 
on april   smartheat investment formed a wholly owned subsidiary in shenyang named smartheat energy with registered capital of million for the research  development  manufacturing and sales of energy products 
we expect smartheat energy to commence operations in on may   we formed smartheat shanghai trading co  ltd 
smartheat trading to market and expand sales of our taiyu branded products  which has yet to commence operations 
our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of high value products  the impact of seasonal spending patterns  the timing and size of projects our customers perform  changes in overall spending levels in the industry and other unpredictable factors that may affect customer ordering patterns 
our revenues may fluctuate significantly due to the seasonal nature of central heating services in the prc  because the equipment used in residential buildings must be delivered and installed prior to the beginning of the heating season in late fall 
additionally  any significant delays in the commercial launch or any lack or delay of commercial acceptance of new products  unfavorable sales trends in existing product lines  or impacts from the other factors mentioned above  could adversely affect our revenue growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenue 
we have not been adversely affected by these trends or weaker demand from steel processing  petrochemical and hvac 
significant accounting policies while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating this management discussion and analysis 
basis of presentation our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap 
principle of consolidation the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of smartheat  taiyu  sandeke  smartheat siping  jinhui  smartheat investment  smartheat energy and smartheat trading 
the company refers collectively to smartheat  taiyu  sandeke  smartheat siping  jinhui  smartheat investment  smartheat energy and smartheat trading 
all significant inter company accounts and transactions were eliminated in consolidation 
use of estimates in preparing the financial statements in conformity with us gaap  management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates  required by management  include the recoverability of long lived assets  allowance for doubtful accounts  and the reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventories 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
accounts receivable our policy is to maintain reserves for potential credit losses on accounts receivable 
management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves 
accounts receivable are net of unearned interest 
unearned interest represents imputed interest on accounts receivable with due dates over one year from the invoice date discounted at our borrowing rate for the year 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a moving weighted average basis 
cost of work in progress and finished goods comprises direct material  direct labor and an allocated portion of production overheads 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost  net of accumulated depreciation 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred  additions  renewals and betterments are capitalized 
when property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of  the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts  and any gain or loss is included in operations 
depreciation of property and equipment is provided using the straight line method with a salvage value and estimated lives as follows building years vehicles years office equipment years production equipment years revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab codified in financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 
sales revenue is recognized when phes and heat meters are delivered  and for phe units when customer acceptance occurs  the price is fixed or determinable  no other significant obligations of the company exist and collectibility is reasonably assured 
payments received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are recorded as unearned revenue 
our agreements with our customers generally provide that of the purchase price is due upon placement of an order  upon delivery and upon installation and acceptance of the equipment after customer testing 
as a common practice in the heating manufacturing business in china  payment of the final of the purchase price is due no later than the termination date of the standard warranty period  which ranges from to months from the acceptance date 
our standard warranty is provided to all customers and is not considered an additional service  rather  it is an integral part of the product sale 
we believe the existence of the standard product warranty in a sales contract does not constitute a deliverable in the arrangement and thus there is no need to apply the eitf codified in fasb asc topic separation and allocation model for a multiple deliverable arrangement 
sfas codified in fasb asc topic specifically addresses the accounting for standard warranties and neither sab nor eitf supersedes sfas we believe accounting for our standard warranty pursuant to sfas does not impact revenue recognition because the cost of honoring the warranty can be reliably estimated 
we provide after sales services at a charge after the expiration of the warranty period  with after sales services mainly consisting of cleaning plate heat exchangers and repairing and exchanging parts 
we recognize such revenue when service is provided 
the revenue earned from these services was not material 
foreign currency translation and comprehensive income loss our functional currency is the chinese yuan renminbi rmb 
for financial reporting purposes  rmb were translated into united states dollars usd as the reporting currency 
assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the reporting period 
translation adjustments arising from the use of different exchange rates from period to period are included as a component of shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in income 
there has been no significant fluctuation in exchange rate for the conversion of rmb to usd after the balance sheet date 
we use statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income codified in fasb asc topic 
comprehensive income is comprised of net income and all changes to the statements of shareholders equity  except those due to investments by shareholders  changes in paid in capital and distributions to shareholders 
recent accounting pronouncements on july   we adopted accounting standards update asu no 
 topic generally accepted accounting principles amendments based on statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles asu no 

asu no 
re defines authoritative us gaap for nongovernmental entities to be only comprised of the fasb accounting standards codification codification and  for sec registrants  guidance issued by the sec 
the codification is a reorganization and compilation of all then existing authoritative us gaap for nongovernmental entities  except for guidance issued by the sec 
the codification is amended to effect non sec changes to authoritative us gaap 
adoption of asu no 
only changed the referencing convention of us gaap in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
on february   the fasb issued asu subsequent events topic  amendments to certain recognition and disclosure requirements  effective immediately 
the amendments in the asu remove the requirement for an sec filer to disclose a date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in both issued and revised financial statements 
revised financial statements include financial statements revised as a result of either correction of an error or retrospective application of us gaap 
the fasb believes these amendments remove potential conflicts with the sec s literature 
the adoption of this asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on march   the fasb issued asu no 
derivatives and hedging topic  scope exception related to embedded credit derivatives 
this asu clarifies the guidance within the derivative literature that exempts certain credit related features from analysis as potential embedded derivatives requiring separate accounting 
the asu specifies that an embedded credit derivative feature related to the transfer of credit risk that is only in the form of subordination of one financial instrument to another is not subject to bifurcation from a host contract under asc  derivatives and hedging embedded derivatives recognition 
all other embedded credit derivative features should be analyzed to determine whether their economic characteristics and risks are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract and whether bifurcation is required 
the asu is effective for us on july  the adoption of this asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb codified the consensus reached in emerging issues task force issue no 
 milestone method of revenue recognition 
fasb asu no 
provides guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research and development transactions 
fasb asu no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   and is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved after the adoption date 
we do not expect this asu will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations upon adoption of this update on january  results of operations year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the following table sets forth the results of our operations for the years indicated as a percentage of net sales of sales of sales sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses income from operations other income expenses  net income tax expense noncontrolling interest net income sales 
net sales in were million  consisting of million for phe units  million for phes  and million for heat meters  while our net sales in  were million  consisting of million for phe units  million for phes  and million for heat meters  an overall increase of million or 
the increase in sales came primarily from two of our product lines  phes and phe units  and benefited from the continued government stimulus in energy saving industry  strong economic growth in china and our successful market expansion 
our sales from our phes brought us additional sales of million or increase in sales in  compared with our phe unit sales increased by million or compared to last year due to our continuous effort on market expansion 
our heat meter products brought us an additional million in sales or increase in sales compared with according to article of china s energy conservation law issued in  new apartments and retrofitted apartments must install heat meters  but the implementation of this government mandated process takes time and differs by region  which may cause our growth rate to fluctuate  however  we expect heat meter sales will witness significant growth in the coming years and we believe we will benefit from this growth as we are one of the top heat meter manufacturers 
we have a strict review process for approving each sales contract  especially with respect to the determination of a selling price 
sales price under each contract is determined in proportion to our estimated cost in order to ensure our gross profit 
our selling price varies on each sale  which depends mainly on each customer s specific needs and our negotiation of the contract amount and term 
we have been continuously expanding the heat supply market in more regions as a result of the prc government s economic stimulus plan stressing increased domestic infrastructure construction as well as continuous research and development on new products

the amount paid for inventory was due to the increase in our sales and production 
net cash flow used in investing activities was million in compared to net cash used in investing activities of million in the increase of net cash flow used in investing activities was due mainly to the acquisition of the land use right of million  purchase of property and equipment of million and million deposited into the bank as restricted cash

the increase in accounts receivable was due to the increase in our sales with most of our accounts receivables due within one year from the sales recognition date 
we also increased payment for advance to suppliers and inventory in order to be prepared for the increased demand of our products 
net cash flow used in investing activities was million in compared to net cash used in investing activities of million in the increase of net cash flow used in investing activities in the was due mainly to purchase of property and equipment for smartheat siping and increase in restricted cash was mainly deposits from customers for securing payment from customers and deposits we paid to a commercial bank for the bank issuing the bank acceptance to its vendors

our agreements with our customers generally provide that of the purchase price is due upon the placement of an order  upon delivery and upon installation and acceptance of the equipment after customer testing 
as a common practice in the heating manufacturing business in china  payment of the final of the purchase price is due no later than the termination date of the standard warranty period  which ranges from to months from the acceptance date 
our receipts for payment on our products depend on the complexity of the equipment ordered  which impacts manufacturing  delivery  installation and testing times and warranty periods 
for example  phes are less complex than phe units and therefore have a shorter manufacturing  acceptance  warranty and payment schedule 
we may experience payment delays from time to time with a range from to months from the due date 
however  we do not believe the delays have a significant negative impact on our liquidity as the payment delays are very common in the heating manufacturing industry in china and the collection of payment can be reasonably assured based on our historical collection experience 
our accounts receivable and inventory turnover are relatively low and days sales outstanding ratio relatively high 
consequently  collection on our sales is slow and capital is tied up in inventories  which may result in pressure on cash flows 
for  we had accounts receivable turnover of on an annualized basis  with days sales outstanding of and inventory turnover of on an annualized basis 
for  we had accounts receivable turnover of on an annualized basis  with days sales outstanding of and inventory turnover of on an annualized basis 
for  we had accounts receivable turnover of on an annualized basis  with days sales outstanding of and inventory turnover of on annualized basis 
the low accounts receivable turnover and high days outstanding is due to the seasonality our sales and postponement of payments from certain customers 
the low inventory turnover for compared to was due to increased inventory on hand for the readiness of the high production season with an increased number of large orders in approximately of our revenue is generated in the third and fourth quarters 
we are in the manufacturing and processing business 
we purchase substantial amounts of raw materials before the high season starts to meet production needs 
there is no concern about inventory obsolescence because our products can be sold for a profit without time limitation as long as there is continued demand 
additionally  we have increased our sales force for developing new customers  which we believe will reduce on hand inventory levels and increase inventory turnover going forward 
therefore  we believe the potential risks and uncertainties associated with lower inventory turnover are limited 
we recognize the final of the purchase price as a retention receivable  which is due no later than the termination of our warranty period 
the deferral of the final payment is a common practice in the heating manufacturing business in china 
sometimes our customers are required to deposit of the sales price on high value products  like an assembled heat exchanger unit or the main part of a plate heat exchanger  into designated bank accounts as restricted cash for securing the payment after such period expires 
based on our historical experience  there have been no defaults on such deferrals 
therefore  we believe the potential risks and uncertainty associated with defaults on such receivables are not material 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any other financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties 
we have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as stockholders equity or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
furthermore  we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support to such entity 
we do not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing  hedging or research and development services with us 
contractual obligations we were obligated for the following short term loans as of december  and from a commercial bank in the prc for rmb  of which rmb  was entered into on april   and was due on april   and rmb  was entered into on june   and was due on june  these loans had an interest rate of 
we pledged our building in the value of rmb  or  for these loans 
we paid the loans in full when they matured 
from a commercial bank in the prc for rmb  entered into on june  the loan currently bears interest at with maturity on june  the loan was guaranteed by third party 
from a commercial bank in the prc for rmb  entered into on october  the loan currently bears interest at with maturity on october  from a commercial bank in the prc for rmb  entered into on october  the loan currently bears interest at with maturity on october  from a commercial bank in the prc for rmb  entered into on august  the loan currently bears interest at with maturity on june  we pledged our building and land use rights for this loan 
the short term borrowings outstanding at december   were  and the weighted average interest rate was 
the maximum short term borrowings outstanding during were  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal operations are in china and substantially all of our revenues and expenses are denominated in renminbi  the functional currency of our subsidiaries in china 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the renminbi and the us dollar will affect our financial results reported in us dollar terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we currently do not engage in forward foreign exchange agreements or other hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
hedging transactions that we may enter into in the future may have limited effectiveness  and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all 
in addition  our foreign currency exchange losses may be magnified by chinese exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert renminbi into foreign currencies 
we are exposed to the price risk that the rising cost of commodities has on certain of our raw materials  including stainless steel used to produce plates for our phes and phe units 
we monitor the commodities markets for pricing trends and changes  but we do not engage in hedging transactions to protect against raw material fluctuations 
instead  we attempt to mitigate the short term risks of price swings by purchasing raw materials in advance based on production needs and projected sales 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash investments 
a significant amount of our cash and cash equivalents  included restricted cash  is held in commercial bank accounts in the prc 
our cash investments policy emphasizes the preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations
