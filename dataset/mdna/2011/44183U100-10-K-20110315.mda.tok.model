item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are an independent energy company focused on the development  exploration  exploitation  acquisition  and production of natural gas and crude oil in the us gulf coast region and in south america 
our oil and gas reserves and operations are concentrated primarily in the south american country of colombia and in the onshore gulf coast region  particularly texas and louisiana 
our mission is to deliver outstanding net asset value per share growth to our investors via attractive oil and gas investments 
our strategy is to focus on early identification of  and entrance into  existing and emerging resource plays  particularly in south america and the us gulf coast 
we typically seek to partner with larger operators in development of resources or retain interests  with or without contribution on our part  in prospects identified  packaged and promoted to larger operators 
by entering these plays earlier and partnering with  or promoting to  larger operators  we believe we can capture larger resource potential at lower cost and minimize our exposure to drilling risks and costs and ongoing operating costs 
we  along with our partners  actively manage our resources through opportunistic acquisitions and divestitures where reserves can be identified  developed  monetized and financial resources redeployed with the objective of growing reserves  production and shareholder value 
generally  we generate nearly all our revenues and cash flows from the sale of produced natural gas and crude oil  whether through royalty interests  working interests or other arrangements 
we may also realize gains and additional cash flows from the periodic divestiture of assets 
recent developments production levels  commodity prices and revenues our production levels  commodity prices realized and revenues during  as compared to  benefited from improved market conditions during as compared to when sharply lower prices prevailed  particularly during the first half of  following the global economic crisis that began in late as a result of depressed commodity prices during the first half of  our operator in colombia temporarily shut in production from a majority of our colombian properties and we had no sales in colombia from february  through april  our december sale of our interest in entities holding four concessions in colombia resulted in sharp declines in our production levels and revenues during the last half of december  and will continue to produce lower production and revenue levels unless and until we can successfully drill wells and bring on line new and or additional production from our other properties

leasehold activity during  we acquired an interest in one additional block in colombia  the lla block  one tea  the macaya tea  and increased our interest in the cpo block in colombia 
macaya tea 
during  we elected to participate for our percentage interest in the macaya technical evaluation agreement the tea 
the tea was entered into in february by and between the colombian national hydrocarbons agency the anh and hupecol operating co 
llc  and encompasses a  acre region located to the southeast of the serrania block  which is located in the municipalities of uribe and la macarena in the department of meta in the republic of colombia 
as a result of the election to participate  we agreed to pay our proportionate share  or  of the acquisition costs and costs for the minimum work program contained in the tea 
lla block 
during  we elected to participate for our percentage interest in the lla block in colombia the lla block 
the lla block was awarded to hupecol by the anh during the lla block is adjacent to the la cuerva block operated by hupecol 
the award of the lla block includes a phase i commitment to shoot square kilometers of d seismic on the block 
as a result of the election to participate  we agreed to pay our proportionate share  or  of all costs of exploiting the block  except the d seismic costs  where we agreed to pay two times our proportional cost 
cpo farmout 
effective july   we entered into a farmout agreement the farmout agreement with sk energy co 
ltd sk energy pursuant to which sk energy agreed to assign to our company an additional interest in the approximately  acre cpo block in the llanos basin of colombia  increasing our current interest in the cpo block from to 
sk energy serves as operator on the cpo block under a joint operating agreement the joa 
under the terms of the farmout agreement  we are responsible for paying our proportionate interest in all future development and operating costs ongoing costs 
in addition to payment of our proportionate interest in ongoing costs  as a condition of assignment of the additional interest in the cpo block  we are responsible for reimbursement to sk energy  or payment  of i of certain defined past costs relating to development of the cpo block the past costs  and ii of seismic acquisition costs incurred with respect to the phase one cost of the cpo block between june  and june  the seismic acquisition costs 
the phase one seismic acquisition was completed during the assignment of the additional interest in the cpo block was conditioned upon the approval by the anh and the republic of korea by july   and payment of our proportionate interest in past costs  which was due on the earlier of i october   or ii days following anh approval 
in november  we were invoiced for  and paid   as our share of the past costs attributable to our additional interest in cpo in december the company received anh approval of our additional interest in block cpo along with the assignment from sk bringing our total interest to in the block 
pursuant to the terms of  and in conjunction with  the farmout agreement and the joa  we entered into a separate agreement with gulf united energy  inc gulf united whereby we waived our right of first refusal under the joa for the specific purpose of permitting gulf united to acquire a interest in the cpo block 
under the agreement with gulf united  as a condition of our agreement to waive our preferential rights  gulf united agreed to pay to us  not later than days following anh approval  i our share of past costs incurred through july   and ii our share of seismic acquisition costs incurred through july  anh approval of the gulf united assignment had not yet been received at december  or through the date of this filing 
it is anticipated that upon gulf united receiving anh approval  it will reimburse us for the  invoiced by sk energy for past costs  plus any additional cost accrued under the terms of the farmout agreement 

table of contents asset sales during  we divested our direct interest in acreage in karnes county  texas and our indirect interest in the dorotea  cabiona  leona and las garzas blocks in colombia 
hupecol dorotea and cabiona  llc and hupecol llanos  llc 
during the fourth quarter of  hupecol dorotea cabiona holdings  llc hupecol d c holdings sold all of its interest in hupecol dorotea and cabiona  llc hdc  llc and hupecol llanos holdings  llc hupecol llanos holdings sold all of its interest in hupecol llanos  llc hl  llc 
we hold a ownership interest in each of hupecol d c holdings and hupecol llanos holdings and  prior to the sale  held indirect interests in identical amounts in hdc  llc and hl  llc 
hdc  llc and hl  llc hold interests in the dorotea  cabiona  leona and las garzas blocks  and related assets  in colombia 
the dorotea  cabiona  leona and las garzas blocks cover an aggregate of approximately  acres 
at december   the estimated proved reserves associated with the blocks totaled  barrels of oil  which represented of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves 
as a result of the sale  we received net proceeds  after deduction of fees and expenses of  before escrow holdbacks  realized a gain on the sale of  and eliminated from oil and gas properties costs subject to amortization associated with the underlying assets totaling  production from the dorotea  cabiona  leona and las garzas blocks accounted for   and  of our revenues during  and fifteen percent of the sales price was held in escrow pursuant to the purchase and sales agreement to fund potential claims arising from the sale with escrowed amounts to be released over a three year period based on amounts remaining in escrow after claims 
in addition to the fifteen percent escrowed  hupecol withheld of the proceeds in escrow for any contingencies that may arise  and it is expected that the company will receive the withheld by hupecol in the company is not aware of any claims that would reduce the escrow amounts as of december  our proportionate interest in the sales proceeds that were withheld and deposited into escrow totaled  and have been recorded as escrow receivables 
following completion of the sale of hdc  llc and hl  llc  we have no continuing interest in the dorotea  cabiona  le ona and las garzas blocks 
karnes county  texas 
in november  we sold our working interest and our of s overriding royalty interest orri in  gross acres in karnes county  texas and our right to a orri in an ami covering approximately  gross acres in karnes county  texas 
we received gross proceeds of million from the sale of our karnes county  texas holdings 
our karnes county  texas holdings were acquired in at a cost of  and  at the time of sale  we had no wells  no production and no reserves associated with the acreage 
seismic activity during  our operators in colombia acquired approximately square miles of additional d and d seismic and geological data 
the additional data relates primarily to the cpo  serrania and la cuerva concessions where we hold   and working interests  respectively 
our share of the costs of such data acquisition was approximately million 
compensation expense in june  our board of directors approved  and we paid  cash bonuses to our senior management team totaling  and  effective june   we increased the base salary of members of our senior management team by 
in august  we expanded our management team with the appointment of a then consultant to serve as senior vice president of exploration 

table of contents also in june  we modified the non cash compensation arrangements for our non employee directors to provide for annual grants of stock options to purchase  shares of common stock 
the option grants vest on the grant date  are exercisable at the fair market value on the grant date and have a term of ten years 
pursuant to such revised compensation arrangements  we granted  stock options to non employee directors on june  and granted  stock options to a newly appointed non employee director in july in august  we granted  stock options to the newly appointed member of our management team 
as a result of these option grants and the amortization of the cost associated with options granted in prior years that remain subject to vesting  we recognized non cash compensation expense for to taling  dividends during  we declared and paid cash dividends to our shareholders of per share  or an aggregate of  development and operating outlook while we continually seek to identify and evaluate opportunities  both domestically and in south america  to acquire interests in early stage high potential resource plays  our focus since the beginning of has been  and continues to be  the development of our colombian assets 
in particular  we have been  and are  focused on development of our cpo and serrania prospects in colombia where we have increased our interest in cpo during  conducted extensive seismic acquisition and analysis  invested in infrastructure and conducted preliminary work in preparation for drilling wells on both of our cpo and serrania prospects 
consistent with our past operating plans  we selectively divest holdings on an opportunistic basis where we believe that favorable prices can be realized from assets and proceeds redeployed to grow our asset base and produce superior returns 
to that end  during  we divested our interest in undeveloped domestic acreage and four blocks in colombia which were in various stages of development  which divestitures produced approximately million of net proceeds including million held in escrow to our company 
during  we plan to invest approximately million in the development of our colombian prospects  including cpo  serrania and four prospects operated by hupecol 
as of january   substantially all seismic  infrastructure and pre drilling work had been completed on both our cpo and serrania prospects and our plans are to drill test wells on the cpo block and test wells on the serrania block during subject to the results of those test wells  we expect to begin developmental drilling of those prospects 
while our asset sales provided funding that we believe will satisfy our financial commitments relating to the cpo and serrania prospects  as well as our remaining hupecol holdings  the interests sold during accounted for approximately of our net oil production and oil revenues during  as well as of our lease operating expenses 
accordingly  until we bring production on line from drilling and development of our cpo  serrania and remaining hupecol prospects  our future production  revenues and lease operating expenses will be substantially lower than levels 
there can be no assurance as to the ultimate success of our drilling and development operations on our cpo  serrania and remaining hupecol prospects or the timing of such drilling and development operations 
critical accounting policies the following describes the critical accounting policies used in reporting our financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  accounting standards allow more than one alternative accounting method for reporting 
such is the case with accounting for oil and gas activities described below 
in those cases  our reported results of operations would be different should we employ an alternative accounting method 

table of contents full cost method of accounting for oil and gas activities 
we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property acquisition  exploration and development activities 
under this method  all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in connection with the exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized 
capitalized costs include lease acquisition  geological and geophysical work  delay rentals  costs of drilling  completing and equipping successful and unsuccessful oil and gas wells and related internal costs that can be directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities  but does not include any cost related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
gain or loss on the sale or other dispositio n of oil and gas properties is not recognized unless significant amounts of oil and gas reserves are involved 
no corporate overhead has been capitalized as of december  the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  plus estimated future development costs relating to proved reserves  are amortized on a units of production method over the estimated productive life of the reserves 
unevaluated oil and gas properties are excluded from this calculation 
the capitalized oil and gas property costs  less accumulated amortization  are limited to an amount the ceiling limitation equal to the sum of a the present value of estimated future net revenues from the projected production of proved oil and gas reserves  calculated using the average oil and natural gas sales price received by the company as of the first trading day of each month over the preceding twelve months such prices are held constant throughout the life of the properties and a discount factor of  b the cost of unproved and uneva luated properties excluded from the costs being amortized  c the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized  and d related income tax effects 
costs in excess of this ceiling are charged to proved properties impairment expense 
unevaluated oil and gas properties 
unevaluated oil and gas properties consist principally of our cost of acquiring and evaluating undeveloped leases  net of an allowance for impairment and transfers to depletable oil and gas properties 
when leases are developed  expire or are abandoned  the related costs are transferred from unevaluated oil and gas properties to oil and gas properties subject to amortization 
additionally  we review the carrying costs of unevaluated oil and gas properties for the purpose of determining probable future lease expirations and abandonments  and prospective discounted future economic benefit attributable to the leases 
unevaluated oil and gas properties not subject to amortization include the following at december  and at december  at december  acquisition costs evaluation costs retention costs total the carrying value of unevaluated oil and gas prospects includes  and  expended for properties in south america at december  and december   respectively 
we are maintaining our interest in these properties and development has or is anticipated to commence within the next twelve months 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc topic we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the volatility of our common stock price over the expected life of the options  dividend yield  an appropriate risk free interest rate and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized on the statements of operations 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  oil and gas revenues 
total oil and gas revenues increased  to  in from  in the increase in revenue is principally due to higher average sales prices for oil and gas during reflecting increased commodity pricing due to improved global macroeconomic conditions compared to and increased oil production due to new wells brought onto production and production from our colombian properties for the full period in as compared to  when production was temporarily shut in for days due to market conditions

joint venture expenses 
joint venture expenses totaled  in compared to  in the joint venture expenses represent our allocable share of the indirect field operating and region administrative expenses billed by the operator of the colombian concessions 
the decrease in joint venture expenses was attributable to the decrease in the number of producing wells during depreciation and depletion expense 
depreciation and depletion expense decreased by to  in from  in the decrease in depreciation and depletion was due to an increase in reserves due to exploration and development 
this resulting increase in our reserves from exploration and development activities lowered our depreciation rate per barrel 
impairment expense 
during  we recorded a provision for impairment of oil and gas properties of  most of which was attributable to our south american properties 
impairments related to reduced commodity prices at year end and lower reserve estimates for our colombian wells  reduced reserve estimates for our us properties as a result of lower commodity prices and lower than expected production volumes  as well as the lack of commercial production on our caddo lake prospect

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 
at december   we had a cash balance of  and working capital of  compared to a cash balance of  and working capital of  at december  the increase in cash and working capital during the period was primarily attributable to the receipt of  net proceeds excluding escrowed monies from the sale of our karnes county  texas property and our indirect interest in four concessions in colombia and operating cash flow  partially offset by payment of drilling costs  acquisition costs  seismic costs and other costs related to the planned drilling of prospects in colombia and the payment of dividends

capital and exploration expenditures and commitments 
our principal capital and exploration expenditures relate to our ongoing efforts to acquire  drill and complete prospects 
we expect that future capital and exploration expenditures will be funded principally through funds generated from operations and funds on hand  including funds generated from our sale of certain properties and our sale of common stock 
during  we invested approximately million for the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties  which included expenses related to drilling of wells in colombia million  seismic and geological costs in colombia million  delay rentals on us properties thousand  and leasehold costs on us properties million 
at december   our only material contractual obligation requiring determinable future payments on our part was our lease relating to our executive offices 
the following table details our contractual obligations as of december payments due by period total year years years years operating leases total in addition to the contractual obligations requiring that we make fixed payments  in conjunction with our efforts to secure oil and gas prospects  financing and services  we have  from time to time  granted overriding royalty interests orri in various properties  and may grant orris in the future  pursuant to which we will be obligated to pay a portion of our interest in revenues from various prospects to third parties 
planned drilling  leasehold and other activities 
as of december   our acquisition and drilling budget for totaled approximately million and related principally to drilling wells in colombia on existing hupecol prospects  drilling wells on the serrania block operated by shona energy  and drilling wells on the cpo block operated by sk energy 
additional wells may be drilled at locations to be determined based on the results of the planned drilling projects 
our acquisition and drilling budget has historically been subject to substantial fluctuation over the course of a year based upon successes and failures in drilling and completion of prospects and the identification of additional prospects during the course of a year 
management anticipates that our current financial resources combined with expected operating cash flows  will meet our anticipated objectives and business operations  including investments in the cpo block and other planned property acquisitions and drilling activities  for at least the next months  without the need for additional capital 
because the timing and actual costs and results associated with development of the serrania block and cpo block cannot be predicted with certainty and because we continually seek opportunities to acquire and develop reserves  it is possible that we may require and seek additional financing to support development of existing prospects or additional prospects that may be acquired in the future 
we have no commitments to provide any additional financing should we require and seek such financing and there is no guarantee that we will be able to secure additional financing on acceptable terms  or at all  to support future acquisitions and development activities 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements or guarantees of third party obligations at december  inflation we believe that inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations since inception 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk the price we receive for our oil and gas production heavily influences our revenue  profitability  access to capital and future rate of growth 
crude oil and natural gas are commodities and  therefore  their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand 
historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile  and these markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future 
the prices we receive for production depends on numerous factors beyond our control 
we have not historically entered into any hedges or other derivative commodity instruments or transactions designed to manage  or limit exposure to oil and gas price volatility
