overview revenues increased to million in compared to million as the global economy  and the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment markets in particular  showed improvement 
in january we completed the acquisition of suss test 
our revenues and market share in the systems business have benefited from the acquisition of suss test 
the improvement in revenue combined with shifts in product mix contributed to increased gross profit and gross margins as we were able to better leverage our fixed overhead costs 
however  acquisition and restructuring related charges in negatively affected our financial results 
we incurred direct acquisition costs of million and restructuring charges totaling million in related to our suss test acquisition and consolidation of certain product lines and facilities 
the restructuring charges were included in our statements of operations as follows in thousands cost of sales  research and development selling  general and administrative  in addition  the income tax benefit of million in attributable primarily to the carryback of losses to income taxes paid in prior years was not available in as a result  our net loss increased to million in from million in outlook for we expect semiconductor and semiconductor equipment markets will show continued strength in  which  based on our market position and continued investment in our products  should result in increased revenue for compared to based on our current backlog  anticipated bookings and normal seasonal pattern in the industry  we expect revenues will be in the range of million to million for the first quarter of

revenue revenue increased million  or  to million in compared to million in and decreased million  or  in compared to million in systems revenue in systems increased million  or  to million in compared to million in and decreased million  or  in compared to million in 
table of contents certain financial information which contributed to the systems revenue results was as follows compared to compared to percentage increase decrease in unit sales percentage increase decrease in average sales price asp the increase in revenue in compared to was the result of both an increase in unit sales and an increase in asps 
we realized increased unit sales due to the overall improvement in semiconductor and semiconductor equipment markets during and our acquisition of suss test in january asp was positively affected by sales mix  as a larger number of high end mm  cryogenic and high power systems were sold 
asp includes the sales price of any analytical probes  probe cards and accessories purchased with a probe station 
the decrease in revenue in compared to was the result of decreased unit sales and decrease in asps 
we realized decreased unit sales in compared to due to the global slow down in semiconductor markets 
asp was negatively affected in compared to by changes in our sales mix  as fewer high end systems were sold in relation to total system sales 
sales of mm  cryogenic and high power systems represented  and of total units sales in  and  respectively 
probes and sockets revenue in probes and sockets increased million  or  to million in compared to million in and decreased million  or  in compared to million in the increase in compared to was primarily the result of increased unit sales driven by the overall improvement in semiconductor design and production markets 
the decrease in compared to was primarily the result of lower unit sales driven by the overall decrease in worldwide semiconductor production 
cost of sales and gross margin cost of sales includes purchased materials  fabrication  assembly  test  installation labor  overhead  customer specific engineering costs  warranty costs  royalties and provision for inventory valuation reserves 
cost of sales increased million  or  to million in compared to million in and decreased million  or  in compared to million in gross margin gross profit as a percentage of net sales was  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in cost of sales in compared to was the result of increased sales as discussed above and changes in gross margin as discussed below 
the decrease in cost of sales in compared to was primarily due to the decrease in sales  partially offset by lower gross margins 
systems systems gross margins increased to in compared to in systems gross margins were positively affected in by changes in sales mix and an increase in average selling prices as described above  as a larger number of high end systems were sold 
systems gross margins were negatively affected in by inventory valuation charges of million compared to 
table of contents million in inventory charges in included restructuring charges of million in the first quarter of for discontinued products following the acquisition of suss test 
in addition  the systems gross margin in was negatively affected by purchase price allocation adjustments to value finished goods and work in process inventory acquired in the suss test acquisition at their estimated selling price less cost to sell 
accordingly  when such inventory was sold  it resulted in near zero gross margins 
during  million of such inventory was sold  with a remaining balance of million as of december  the systems gross margin decreased to in compared to in  primarily due to the overall decrease in sales volume and change in product mix 
we sold fewer mm systems in relation to total system sales  which typically yield higher margins than non mm systems due to their higher average sales prices and sales of accessories 
the decrease in gross margin due to volume and product mix was partially offset by decreases in salaries  benefits and overhead costs 
probes and sockets the probes and sockets gross margin decreased to in compared to in gross margins in were negatively affected by sales mix as a higher number of lower margin analytical probes that are sourced from third parties were sold due to the acquisition of suss test in january in addition  we recorded inventory valuation charges of million in  compared to million in and restructuring charges of million in the second quarter of related to our sockets business in minnesota 
the increase in sales positively affected gross margins during as unallocated fixed overhead costs recorded as period expenses in cost of sales decreased as compared to the probes and sockets gross margin decreased to in compared to in  primarily due to the decrease in sales volume as production costs for probes and sockets have a higher component of fixed overhead than systems 
as sales volumes decline  unallocated fixed overhead costs recorded as a period expense in cost of sales increase 
the impact of the decline in sales volume was partially offset by an overall reduction in salaries  benefits and overhead costs and improvement in yields on certain product lines 
research and development research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include compensation and related expenses for personnel  materials  consultants and overhead 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to million in compared to million in and decreased million  or  in compared to million in the overall increase in expense in was primarily the result of the suss test acquisition in january these variations consisted of the following compared to increase in wages and benefits due to headcount increase in professional fees increase in travel  meals and entertainment increase in project expenses increase in incentive compensation increase in depreciation expense increase in allocated occupancy expenses increase in software expense increase in severance costs increase in training and seminars other  net

sg a expense increased million  or  to million in compared to million in and decreased million  or  in compared to million in the overall increase in expense in compared to was primarily the result of the suss test acquisition in january and the increase in sales 
the changes were due to the following compared to increase in wages and benefits due to headcount increase in internal and external sales commissions increase in professional fees increase in travel  meals and entertainment increase in severance costs increase in incentive compensation increase in advertising  sales materials and event fees increase in occupancy expenses increase in departmental supplies increase in board and public company costs increase in equipment repairs and maintenance other  net

amortization expense increased million to million in compared to million in and decreased million in compared million in the decrease in compared to was due to the asset impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of net purchased intangibles totaled million at december  asset impairment asset impairment charges included the following in thousands year ended december  goodwill purchased intangible assets patents during the fourth quarter of  the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment markets continued to deteriorate and the trading price of our common stock declined significantly 
based on these factors  our annual impairment test of goodwill indicated that the implied fair value of our identified reporting units was less than the carrying value of goodwill at december  we also tested long lived assets for impairment  which indicated that the fair value of certain long lived assets were less than carrying value as of december  accordingly  we recorded impairment charges of million in the fourth quarter of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k for additional information 
other income expense other income expense typically includes interest income  interest expense  gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency gains and losses 
other income expense can also include other miscellaneous non operating gains and losses 

table of contents other income expense  net was comprised of the following in thousands year ended december  interest income  net foreign currency gains losses losses on foreign currency forward contracts other interest income represents interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities 
the decreases in compared to was due to a combination of a decrease in the yields on investments and decreased cash and investment balances resulting from our purchase of suss test in january the decrease in compared to was primarily due to a decrease in interest rates on investments 
foreign currency gains and losses primarily result from a combination of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the net value of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in yen  euro and other foreign currencies 
included an adjustment for foreign currency re measurement related to  which increased other income in by million 
income taxes our provision benefit for income taxes totaled  or of loss before income taxes  in  million  or of loss before income taxes  in and million  or of loss before income taxes  in generally  the provision for income taxes is the result of the mix of profits losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates and changes in tax reserves 
our tax provision in included tax expense due to taxable income in foreign tax jurisdictions for  offset by a net benefit in germany that was primarily related to the release of the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets due to the acquisition of suss test in the first quarter of the income tax benefit for was primarily attributable to a tax relief act signed into law during the fourth quarter of that increased the carryback of our net operating losses from to years 
the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate due primarily to the full reserve we recorded against our domestic deferred tax assets and the goodwill write off  which was not deductable for tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities in was million and consisted of our net loss of million  offset by net non cash expenses of million and net changes in our operating assets and liabilities as described below 
accounts receivable  net increased by million to million at december   compared to million at december  the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to our increased sales in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of inventories increased by million to million at december   compared to million at december  the increase in inventory was primarily due to increased purchases to support our increased sales  partially offset by million of inventory valuation charges as discussed above 
if our actual results are significantly different than our current expectations for  we may incur additional inventory charges in future periods 

table of contents accounts payable increased by million to million at december   compared to million at december  primarily due to increased inventory purchases to support our increased sales 
accrued liabilities increased by million to million at december   compared to million at december  primarily due to a million increase in accrued income taxes due to the timing of payments  a million increase in accrued compensation and benefits due to headcount and the timing of payroll  accrued restructuring costs of million  a million increase in accrued commissions and a million increase in warranties due to increased sales 
fixed asset purchases of million in were primarily for information technology  production equipment and office related equipment 
we anticipate fixed asset additions for to be approximately million  primarily for production related equipment  facility improvements  research and development tools and information technology 
in january  we utilized million of cash and cash equivalents  net of cash acquired  for the purchase of suss test 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we anticipate meeting our cash requirements for the next months and for the foreseeable future from existing cash and cash equivalents and short term marketable securities  which totaled million at december  we continue to evaluate opportunities for acquisition and expansion and any such transactions  if consummated  may use a portion of our cash and marketable securities 
seasonality typically  our first quarter revenues are lower than our revenues from the preceding fourth quarter 
in addition  as is typical in our industry  we recognize a large percentage of our quarterly revenue in the last month of the quarter 
however  our seasonality can be affected by general economic trends and it should not be expected that historical revenue patterns will continue 
contractual commitments the following is a summary of our contractual commitments and obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligation total and and and beyond operating leases capital leases purchase order commitments forward contracts purchase order commitments primarily represent open orders for inventory 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that have become increasingly difficult to make in the current economic environment 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
it is possible that the estimates we make may change in the future 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue from product sales to customers that do not have acceptance criteria  including product sales to distributors  is recognized when a written purchase order has been obtained  the product is shipped  title has transferred  no obligations remain and collectibility is reasonably assured 
generally  we ship our products with origin terms 
for any shipments with destination terms  we defer revenue until delivery to the customer 
revenue from customers who have acceptance criteria beyond our standard terms and conditions is deferred until all acceptance criteria are satisfied 
revenue for installation services  consisting of assembly and testing  and for systems shipped to integrators is also deferred 
deferred revenue related to service contracts is recognized over the life of the contract  typically one to two years 
deferred revenue for systems shipped to integrators is recognized upon shipment to the final customer 
our transactions may involve the sale of systems and services under multiple element arrangements 
revenue under multiple element arrangements is allocated based on the fair value of each element 
a typical multiple element arrangement may include some or all of the following components products  accessories  installation services and extended warranty contracts 
the total sales price is allocated based on the relative fair value of each component when sold separately 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on past collection history and known trends with current customers 
our estimates for allowance for doubtful accounts are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
changes to the reserve occur based upon changes in revenue levels  associated balances in accounts receivable and estimated changes in collectability 
the current economic environment has increased both the risk of bad debt and the difficulty in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the fourth quarter of  we increased the allowance for doubtful accounts by million  primarily for the specific reserve of receivables from one customer 
in  we had specific charges to the bad debt reserve of  and recoveries of previously reserved accounts of  in  we had a net reversal of charges to the bad debt reserve of million and recoveries of previously reserved accounts of  valuation of excess and obsolete inventory we regularly analyze the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including  but not limited to  the following forecasted sales or usage  historical usage rates  estimated service period  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values  service inventory requirements and new product introductions 
inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates cost  computed on a first in  first out basis  or market and include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
inventory is reviewed for obsolescence and excess quantities on a quarterly basis  based on estimated future use of quantities on hand  which is determined based on past usage  planned changes to products and known trends in markets and technology 
because of the long lived nature of many of our products  we maintain a supply of parts for use in future repairs and customer field service 
as these service parts become older  we apply a higher write down against the recorded balance  recognizing that the older the part  the less likely it will be used 
if circumstances related to our inventories change  our estimates of the value of inventory could materially change 
inventory write downs are recorded quarterly as a component of cost of sales 
goodwill impairment testing goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a purchase business combination 
goodwill is not amortized but rather is reviewed for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if a triggering event occurs 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step test 
under the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its 
table of contents carrying value  and  if an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit  the enterprise must perform step two of the impairment test measurement 
under step two  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill as determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow dcf analysis 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  step two does not need to be performed 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill  which indicated that the implied fair value of our identified reporting units was less than the carrying value of goodwill at december  accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of and  as of december   we had no goodwill recorded on our balance sheet 
goodwill of million at december  relates to our acquisition of suss test in january this goodwill relates to our systems segment and represents the value of assembled workforce and other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition 
our impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of did not indicate impairment of goodwill 
lives and recoverability of equipment and other long lived assets we evaluate the remaining lives and recoverability of equipment and other assets  including our intangible assets  other than goodwill  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
if there is an indication of impairment  we prepare an estimate of future  undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we adjust the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value 
such reviews assess the fair value of the assets based upon estimates of discounted future cash flows that the assets are expected to generate 
during  we recorded million of write downs to property and equipment in connection with our restructuring activities 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during  based on the results of our testing  we recorded impairment charges of million against purchased intangible assets and million against patents 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we did not record any impairment charges for long lived assets during warranty liabilities warranty costs include labor to repair the system and replacement parts for defective items  as well as other costs incidental to warranty repairs 
we estimate a liability for costs to repair or replace products under warranties ranging from days to one year and technical support costs when the related product revenue is recognized 
the liability for product warranties is calculated as a percentage of sales 
the percentage is based on historical actual product repair costs 
our estimated warranty costs are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
changes to the reserve occur as volume  product mix and actual warranty costs fluctuate 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we record deferred tax assets for the estimated future benefit of research and development tax credits  foreign tax credits  net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences 
a valuation allowance is recorded when management can not reach the conclusion that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
based on this evaluation  in  we recorded a million charge to establish a full valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets  and increased the valuation allowance against foreign deferred tax assets by  we continued to record a full valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets and certain foreign deferred tax assets in 
table of contents in  we increased our valuation allowance by million  which included increases for changes in our net deferred tax assets during  partially offset by a million reduction of our valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets in germany in connection with our acquisition of suss test in january the valuation allowance totaled million and million  respectively  at december  and at december   we had net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet totaling million  primarily related to foreign jurisdictions 
we may record additional valuation allowances in the future 
uncertainty in income taxes we recognize the benefits of tax return positions in our financial statements if we determine that the positions are more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority 
interest and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as tax expense within our financial statements 
at december   we had total unrecognized tax benefits of million 
all unrecognized tax benefits would have an impact on the effective tax rate if recognized 
the interest and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits were insignificant 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted to our employees and directors  including stock options  restricted stock units and stock purchases related to our employee stock purchase plan  based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date 
we use the black scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards 
the black scholes model requires us to make assumptions regarding the risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield  expected term and expected volatility over the expected term of the award 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of expense could be materially different in the future 
accounting pronouncements issued not yet adopted see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for a discussion of accounting pronouncements issued not yet adopted 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we sometimes attempt to mitigate our currency exposures for recorded transactions by using forward exchange contracts 
the purpose of these activities is to reduce the risk that future cash flows of the underlying assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
in some cases  we enter into forward sale or purchase contracts for foreign currencies  primarily the japanese yen  to hedge specific receivables 
as of december   we had contracts outstanding for the purchase of japanese yen totaling approximately million  which mature through june historically  we have not attempted to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the remeasurement of our subsidiaries net assets and results of operations  nor do we enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
our forward exchange contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and  accordingly  gains and losses on our forward exchange contracts are recognized currently as a component of other income expense 

table of contents interest rate risk our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investments 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in diversified investments  consisting only of investment grade securities 
as of december   we held cash and cash equivalents  short term marketable securities and restricted cash and cash equivalents of million 
based on the nature of our marketable securities  a decline in interest rates over time would reduce our interest income  but would not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows  as we have classified our securities as available for sale and  therefore  may choose to sell or hold them as changes in the market occur 
a decrease in interest rates of one percent would cause a corresponding decrease in our annual interest income of approximately million  assuming our december  balances remained constant 
in addition  due to the nature of our highly liquid cash equivalents  a change in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of our cash equivalents
