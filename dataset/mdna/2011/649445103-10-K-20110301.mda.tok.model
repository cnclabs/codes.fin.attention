table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the purpose of this discussion and analysis  the words we  us  our  and the company are used to refer to new york community bancorp  inc and our consolidated subsidiaries  including new york community bank the community bank and new york commercial bank the commercial bank collectively  the banks 
executive summary in  a confluence of factors  both strategic and external  resulted in our delivering a strong financial performance  highlighted by significant revenue growth  greater efficiency  substantially higher loan production  above average asset quality  and increased capital strength 
among the factors contributing to our financial results were the full year benefit of our fdic assisted acquisition of certain assets and assumption of certain liabilities of amtrust bank amtrust on december   which added branches in ohio  florida  and arizona to our current community bank franchise  the full year operation of our mortgage banking platform in cleveland  which ranks among the top wholesale aggregators of one to four family loans for sale in the united states  and generates mortgage income through both originations and servicing  the nine month benefit of our fdic assisted acquisition of certain assets and assumption of certain liabilities of desert hills bank desert hills on march   which added six branches to our community bank franchise in arizona at the time of acquisition three after consolidation  expanding our locations in that state to  reductions in the balance of certificates of deposit cds and the balance of wholesale borrowings through the deployment of cash received in the amtrust acquisition  and from the sale of securities and loans  a significant increase in loans produced for investment  reflecting an increase in property transactions and refinancing activity  a significant decline in losses on the other than temporary impairment otti of securities  which had a meaningful adverse impact on our earnings in  and the maintenance of the target federal funds rate at an historically low range of zero to basis points  which enabled us to further reduce our retail funding costs  grow our net interest income  and expand our net interest margin 
while the preceding factors contributed to our financial performance  the following factors tempered the growth of our earnings during the year a mid year increase in fdic insurance premiums to replenish the deposit insurance fund  which increased our general and administrative expense  continued economic weakness  as indicated by the still high rate of unemployment  declining real estate values  and an increase in foreclosure filings and bankruptcies the national unemployment rate declined from in december to at the end of this december  a measure last seen in may  and prior to that  in july closer to home  the 
table of contents unemployment rate improved to from in new york city  and to from in new jersey  while holding firm at on long island 
while the unemployment rate improved to from in ohio  it held steady at in florida and increased from to in arizona over the course of the year 
real estate values fell year over year on a nationwide level  and also declined in the markets where most of the properties collateralizing our loans are based 
specifically  real estate values fell in the new york metropolitan region  in greater cleveland  in greater miami  and in greater phoenix 
on a more encouraging note  the office vacancy rate in manhattan improved to in december from in december although the number of foreclosure filings rose in  to  that increase was far more modest than the increase reported for however  during this time  the number of bankruptcies rose to million  as a reduction in the number of business bankruptcy filings was exceeded by a increase in bankruptcy filings by individuals 
against this backdrop  we experienced an increase in net charge offs and non performing assets  which led us to increase our provision for losses on non covered loans in in addition  the increase in non performing assets led to an increase in legal and other expenses in connection with the management and operation of other real estate owned oreo 
reflecting all of these factors  we reported earnings of million  representing a million  or  increase from the year earlier level and an  or  increase in diluted earnings per share to 
total revenues the sum of net interest income and non interest income rose million  or  year over year  to billion  far exceeding the impact of a million increase in operating expenses to million 
as a result  our efficiency ratio improved to from in net interest income accounted for million of the year over year increase in total revenues  having risen  to billion  while non interest income rose million to million from the year earlier amount 
the same factors that contributed to the growth of our net interest income contributed to the expansion of our net interest margin  which rose basis points to in loans originated for investment rose million  or  year over year  to billion  including a million  or  increase in multi family loans to billion and a million  or  increase in commercial real estate loans to million 
multi family loans represented billion  or  of total non covered loans held for investment at the end of this december  with commercial real estate loans representing billion  or  the next largest amount 
although non performing non covered assets rose to million at december   representing of total non covered assets  this balance was substantially lower than the balances we recorded at march  june  and september  in the twelve months ended december   net charge offs rose to million  representing of average loans 
during this time  we increased our provision for losses on non covered loans to million  representing a year over year increase of million 
the growth of our earnings in contributed to an increase in our capital measures  as stockholders equity rose million to billion  and tangible stockholders equity rose million to billion  after dividends totaling million were distributed to our shareholders over the course of the year 
at december   tangible stockholders equity represented of tangible assets  signifying a year over year improvement of basis points 
please see the discussion and reconciliations of our stockholders equity and tangible stockholders equity  total assets and tangible assets  and the related measures that appear later in this report 
recent events dividend declaration on january   the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share  payable on february  to shareholders of record at the close of business on february  
table of contents critical accounting policies we consider certain accounting policies to be critically important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  since they require management to make complex or subjective judgments  some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
the sensitivity of our consolidated financial statements to these critical accounting policies  and the judgments  estimates  and assumptions used therein  could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have identified the following to be critical accounting policies the determination of the allowance for loan losses on non covered loans held for investment  the determination of whether an impairment of securities is other than temporary  the determination of the amount  if any  of goodwill impairment  and the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
the judgments used by management in applying these critical accounting policies may be influenced by a further and prolonged deterioration in the economic environment  which may result in changes to future financial results 
in addition  the current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in our judgments  estimates  and assumptions 
allowance for loan losses for the purposes of this discussion  allowance for loan losses refers to the allowance for losses on non covered loans held for investment and loans refers to non covered loans held for investment 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by provisions for loan losses that are charged against earnings  and is reduced by net charge offs and or reversals  if any  that are credited to earnings 
loans are held by either the community bank or the commercial bank  and a separate loan loss allowance is established for each 
in addition  except as otherwise noted below  the process for establishing the allowance for loan losses is the same for each of the community bank and the commercial bank 
in determining the respective allowances for loan losses  management considers the community bank s and the commercial bank s current business strategies and credit processes  including compliance with conservative guidelines established by the respective boards of directors with regard to credit limitations  loan approvals  underwriting criteria  and loan workout procedures 
the allowances for loan losses are established based on our evaluation of the probable inherent losses in our portfolio in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the allowances for loan losses are comprised of both specific valuation allowances and general valuation allowances which are determined in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards 
specific valuation allowances are established based on our analyses of individual loans that are considered impaired 
if a loan is deemed to be impaired  management measures the extent of the impairment and establishes a specific valuation allowance for that amount 
a loan is classified as impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect both the principal and interest due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we apply this classification as necessary to loans individually evaluated for impairment in our portfolios of multi family  commercial real estate  acquisition  development  and construction  and commercial and industrial loans 
smaller balance homogenous loans and loans carried at the lower of cost or fair value are evaluated for impairment on a collective rather than an individual basis 
we generally measure impairment on an individual loan and the extent to which a specific valuation allowance is necessary by comparing the loan s outstanding balance to either the fair value of the collateral  less the estimated cost to sell  or the present value of expected cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
a specific valuation allowance is established when the fair value of the collateral  net of estimated costs to sell  or the present value of the expected cash flows  is less than the recorded investment in the loan 
we also follow a process to assign general valuation allowances to loan categories 
general valuation allowances are established by applying our loan loss provisioning methodology  and reflect the inherent risk in outstanding held for investment loans 
our loan loss provisioning methodology considers various factors in determining the appropriate quantified risk factors to use to determine the general valuation allowances 
the factors assessed begin with the historical loan loss experience for each of the major loan categories we maintain 
our historical loan loss experience is then adjusted by considering qualitative or environmental factors that are likely to cause estimated credit losses associated with the existing portfolio to differ from historical loss experience  including  but not limited to  the following 
table of contents changes in lending policies and procedures  including changes in underwriting standards and collection  charge off  and recovery practices  changes in international  national  regional  and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio  including the condition of various market segments  changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and in the terms of loans  changes in the volume and severity of past due loans  the volume of non accrual loans  and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded loans  changes in the quality of our loan review system  changes in the value of the underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans  the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit  and changes in the level of such concentrations  changes in the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and other relevant staff  and the effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the existing portfolio 
by considering the factors discussed above  we determine quantified risk factors that are applied to each non impaired loan or loan type in the loan portfolio to determine the general valuation allowances 
in recognition of recent macroeconomic and real estate market conditions  the time periods considered for historical loss experience continue to be the last three years and the current period 
we also evaluate the sufficiency of the overall allocations used for the loan loss allowance by considering the loss experience in the current calendar year 
the process of establishing the loan loss allowances also involves periodic inspections of the loan collateral by qualified in house property appraisers inspectors  as applicable  regular meetings of executive management with the pertinent board committee  during which observable trends in the local economy and or the real estate market are discussed  assessment by the pertinent members of the boards of directors of the aforementioned factors when making a business judgment regarding the impact of anticipated changes on the future level of loan losses  and analysis of the portfolio in the aggregate  as well as on an individual loan basis  taking into consideration payment history  underwriting analyses  and internal risk ratings 
in order to determine their overall adequacy  each of the respective loan loss allowances is reviewed quarterly by management and by the mortgage and real estate committee of the community bank s board of directors the mortgage committee or the credit committee of the board of directors of the commercial bank the credit committee  as applicable 
we charge off loans  or portions of loans  in the period that such loans  or portions thereof  are deemed uncollectible 
the collectability of individual loans is determined through an estimate of the fair value of the underlying collateral and or an assessment of the financial condition and repayment capacity of the borrower 
the level of future additions to the respective loan loss allowances is based on many factors  including certain factors that are beyond management s control such as changes in economic and local market conditions  including declines in real estate values  and increases in vacancy rates and unemployment 
management uses the best available information to recognize losses on loans or to make additions to the loan loss allowances  however  the community bank and or the commercial bank may be required to take certain charge offs and or recognize further additions to their loan loss allowances  based on the judgment of regulatory agencies with regard to information provided to them during their examinations of the banks 

table of contents investment securities the securities portfolio primarily consists of mortgage related securities and  to a lesser extent  debt and equity together  other securities 
securities that are classified as available for sale are carried at their estimated fair value  with any unrealized gains or losses  net of taxes  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity 
securities that we have the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost  less the non credit portion of other than temporary impairment recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of tax aocl 
the fair values of our securities and particularly our fixed rate securities are affected by changes in market interest rates and credit spreads 
in general  as interest rates rise and or credit spreads widen  the fair value of fixed rate securities will decline  as interest rates fall and or credit spreads tighten  the fair value of fixed rate securities will increase 
we regularly conduct a review and evaluation of our securities portfolio to determine if the decline in the fair value of any security below its carrying amount is other than temporary 
if we deem any decline in value to be other than temporary  the security is written down to its current fair value  creating a new cost basis  and the resultant loss other than the otti on debt securities attributable to non credit factors is charged against earnings and recorded in non interest income 
our assessment of a decline in fair value includes judgment as to the financial position and future prospects of the entity that issued the investment security  as well as a review of the security s underlying collateral 
broad changes in the overall market or interest rate environment generally will not lead to a write down 
prior to april   when the decline in fair value below an investment s carrying amount was deemed to be other than temporary  the investment was written down to fair value and the amount of the write down was charged to earnings 
a decline in fair value of an investment was deemed to be other than temporary if we did not have the intent and ability to hold the investment to its anticipated recovery 
effective april   with the adoption of revised otti accounting guidance  unless we have the intent to sell  or it is more likely than not that we may be required to sell a security before recovery  otti is recognized as a realized loss on the income statement to the extent that the decline in fair value is credit related 
if there is a decline in fair value of a security below its carrying amount and we have the intent to sell it  or it is more likely than not that we may be required to sell the security before recovery  the entire amount of the decline in fair value is charged to earnings 
goodwill impairment goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite useful life and is tested for impairment  rather than amortized  at the reporting unit level  at least once a year 
as each of the company s operating segments is comprised of only one component  goodwill is tested for impairment at the segment level 
the goodwill impairment analysis is a two step test 
the first step step is used to identify potential impairment  and involves comparing each reporting segment s estimated fair value to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting segment exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is considered not to be impaired 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value  there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step step is performed to measure the amount 
step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting segment for which impairment was indicated in step the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill calculated in a business combination  ie  by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting segment  as determined in step  over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets  liabilities  and identifiable intangibles  as if the reporting segment was being acquired in a business combination at the impairment test date 
if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to the reporting segment  there is no impairment 
if the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting segment exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting segment  and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill 
subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted 
quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are used as the basis for measurement  when available 
other acceptable valuation methods include present value measurements based on multiples of earnings or revenues  or similar performance measures 
differences in the identification of reporting units and in valuation techniques could result in materially different evaluations of impairment 

table of contents for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing  management has determined that the company has two reporting segments banking operations and residential mortgage banking 
as of december   all of our recorded goodwill had resulted from prior acquisitions and  accordingly  was attributed to banking operations 
there is no goodwill associated with residential mortgage banking  as it was acquired in our fdic assisted amtrust acquisition  which resulted in a bargain purchase gain 
in order to perform our annual goodwill impairment test  we determined the carrying value of the banking operations segment as the carrying value of the company and compared it to the fair value of the banking operations segment as the fair value of the company
