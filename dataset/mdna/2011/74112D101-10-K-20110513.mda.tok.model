item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
marketing and sales our marketing strategy is based upon the acquisition and the rejuvenation of established consumer brands that possess what we believe to be significant brand value and unrealized potential 
our marketing objective is to increase sales and market share by developing innovative new products and line extensions and executing professionally designed  creative and cost effective advertising and promotional programs 
after we acquire a brand  we implement a brand building strategy that uses the brand s existing consumer awareness to maximize sales of current products and provides a vehicle to drive growth through product innovation 
this brand building process involves the evaluation of the existing brand name  the development and introduction of innovative new products and the execution of professionally designed support programs 
recognizing that financial resources are limited  we allocate our resources to focus on our core brands that we believe have the greatest opportunities for growth and financial success 
brand priorities vary from year to year and generally revolve around new product introductions 
customers our senior management team and dedicated sales force strive to maintain long standing relationships with our top domestic customers  which accounted for approximately  and of our combined gross sales for  and  respectively 
our sales management team has grown to people in order to focus on our key customer relationships 
we also contract with third party sales management enterprises that interface directly with our remaining customers and report directly to members of our sales management team 
we enjoy broad distribution across each of the major retail channels  including mass merchandisers  drug  food  dollar and club stores 
the following table sets forth the percentage of gross sales across our five major distribution channels during each of the three years ended march percentage of gross sales channel of distribution mass food drug dollar club other includes estimates for some of our wholesale customers that service more than one distribution channel 
due to the diversity of our product line  we believe that each of these channels is important to our business and we continue to seek opportunities for growth in each channel 
our principal customer relationships include walmart  walgreens  cvs  target and dollar tree 
sales to our top five and ten customers accounted for approximately and of total gross sales  respectively  in compared with approximately and  respectively  in and approximately and  respectively  in no single customer other than walmart accounted for more than of our gross sales in any of those years and none of our other top five customers accounted for less than of our gross sales in any of those years 
our strong customer relationships and product recognition provide us with a number of important benefits including i minimization of slotting fees  ii maximization of new product introductions  iii maximization of shelf space prominence and iv minimization of cash collection days 
we believe that management s emphasis on strong customer relationships  speed and flexibility and leading sales technology capabilities  combined with consistent marketing support programs and ongoing product innovation  will continue to maximize our competitiveness in the increasingly complex retail environment 
the following table sets forth a list of our primary distribution channels and our principal customers for each channel distribution channel customers distribution channel customers mass kmart drug cvs meijer rite aid target walgreens walmart dollar dollar general food ahold dollar tree kroger family dollar publix safeway club bj s wholesale club supervalu costco sam s club outsourcing and manufacturing in order to maximize our competitiveness and efficiently allocate our resources  third party manufacturers fulfill all of our manufacturing needs 
we have found that contract manufacturing maximizes our flexibility and responsiveness to industry and consumer trends while minimizing the need for capital expenditures 
we select contract manufacturers based on their core competencies and our perception of the best overall value  including factors such as i depth of services  ii professionalism and integrity of the management team  iii manufacturing flexibility  iv regulatory compliance and v competitive pricing 
we also conduct thorough reviews of each potential manufacturer s facilities  quality standards  capacity and financial stability 
we generally purchase only finished products from our manufacturers 
our primary contract manufacturers provide comprehensive services from product development through the manufacturing of finished goods 
they are responsible for such matters as i production planning  ii product research and development  iii procurement  iv production  v quality testing  and vi almost all capital expenditures 
in most instances  we provide our contract manufacturers with guidance in the areas of i product development  ii performance criteria  iii regulatory guidance  iv sourcing of packaging materials and v monthly master production schedules 
this management approach results in minimal capital expenditures and maximizes our cash flow  which is reinvested to support our marketing initiatives  used to fund brand acquisitions or to repay outstanding indebtedness 
at march   we had relationships with over third party manufacturers 
of those  we had long term contracts with manufacturers that produced items that accounted for approximately of our gross sales for each of and compared to manufacturers with long term contracts that produced approximately of gross sales in the fact that we do not have long term contracts with certain manufacturers means that they could cease manufacturing these products at any time and for any reason  or initiate arbitrary and costly price increases which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
at march   suppliers for our key brands included i fitzpatrick bros 
inc  ii access business group  iii aspen pharmacare  iv altaire pharmaceuticals  inc  v bestsweet  inc  and vi pharma tech industries 
we enter into manufacturing agreements for a majority of our products by sales volume  each of which vary based on the capabilities of the third party manufacturer and the products being supplied 
these agreements explicitly outline the manufacturer s obligations and product specifications with respect to the brand or brands being produced 
the purchase price of products under these agreements is subject to change pursuant to the terms of these agreements due to fluctuations in raw material  packaging and labor costs 
all of our other products are manufactured on a purchase order basis which is generally based on batch sizes and results in no long term obligations or commitments 
warehousing and distribution we receive orders from retailers and or brokers primarily by electronic data interchange  which automatically enters each order into our computer systems and then routes the order to our distribution center 
the distribution center will  in turn  send a confirmation that the order was received  fill the order and ship the order to the customer  while sending a shipment confirmation to us 
upon receipt of the confirmation  we send an invoice to the customer 
we manage product distribution in the mainland united states primarily through one facility located in st 
louis  owned and operated by a third party provider 
our warehouse provider provides warehouse services  including without limitation  storage  handling and shipping with respect to our full line of products  as well as transportation services  including without limitation  i complete management services  ii claims administration  iii proof of delivery  iv procurement  v report generation  and vi automation and freight payment services with respect to our full line of products 
if our warehouse provider abruptly stopped providing warehousing or transportation services to us  our business operations could suffer a temporary disruption while new service providers are engaged 
we believe this process could be completed quickly and any temporary disruption resulting therefrom would not be likely to have a significant effect on our operating results and financial condition 
however  a serious disruption  such as a flood or fire  to our distribution center could damage our inventory and could materially impair our ability to distribute our products to customers in a timely manner or at a reasonable cost 
we could incur significantly higher costs and experience longer lead times associated with the distribution of our products to our customers during the time required to reopen or replace our distribution center 
as a result  any such serious or prolonged disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
competition the business of selling brand name consumer products in the otc healthcare and household cleaning categories is highly competitive 
these markets include numerous national and global manufacturers  distributors  marketers and retailers that actively compete for consumers business both in the united states and abroad 
many of these competitors are larger and have substantially greater research and development and financial resources than we do 
consequently  they may have the ability to spend more aggressively on advertising and marketing and research and development  and to respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions 
if this were to occur  our sales  operating results and profitability could be adversely affected 
in addition  we are experiencing increased competition from so called private label products introduced by major retail chains 
while we believe that our branded products provide superior quality and benefits  we are unable to predict whether consumers will continue to purchase private label products at increasing rates after the conclusion of the current economic downturn 
our principal competitors vary by industry category 
competitors in the otc healthcare category include johnson johnson  maker of visine  which competes with our clear eyes and murine brands  mcneil ppc owned by johnson johnson  maker of children tylenol and novartis consumer healthcare  maker of triaminic  each of which competes with our pediacare and little remedies brands  the procter gamble company  maker of vicks  and reckitt benckiser  maker of cepacol  each of which competes with our chloraseptic brand  kraft foods  maker of halls  which competes with our luden brand  the procter gamble company  maker of fixodent  and glaxosmithkline  maker of polident  each of which competes with our efferdent brand  and insight pharmaceuticals  inc maker of bonine  which competes with our dramamine brand 
other competitors in the otc category include merck  maker of dr 
scholl s  which competes with our compound w and wartner brands  glaxosmithkline  maker of debrox  which competes with our murine ear care brand  sunstar america  inc  maker of the gum line of oral care products  as well as dentek oral care  inc  which markets a dental protector for nighttime teeth grinding and interdental toothpicks  each of which competes with our the doctor s oral care brand 
competitors in the household cleaning category include henkel ag co  maker of soft scrub  colgate palmolive company  maker of ajax cleanser  and the clorox company  maker of tilex  each of which competes with our comet brand 
additionally  clorox s pine sol and procter gamble s mr 
clean compete with our spic and span brand  while m company  maker of scotch brite  o cel o and dobie brands  and clorox s sos  compete with our chore boy brand 
we compete on the basis of numerous factors  including brand recognition  product quality  performance  price and product availability at the retail level 
advertising  promotion  merchandising and packaging  the timing of new product introductions and line extensions also have a significant impact on customers buying decisions and  as a result  on our sales 
the structure and quality of our sales force  as well as sell through of our products  affects in store position  wall display space and inventory levels in retail outlets 
if we are unable to maintain the inventory levels and in store positioning of our products in retail stores  our sales and operating results will be adversely affected 
our markets are also highly sensitive to the introduction of new products  which may rapidly capture a significant share of the market 
an increase in the amount of new product introductions and the levels of advertising spending by our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
regulation product regulation the formulation  manufacturing  packaging  labeling  distribution  importation  sale and storage of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies  including the fda  the federal trade commission ftc  the consumer product safety commission cpsc  and the environmental protection agency epa  and various agencies of the states  localities and foreign countries in which our products are manufactured  distributed and sold 
our regulatory team is guided by a senior member of management and staffed by individuals with appropriate legal and regulatory experience 
our regulatory and operations teams work closely with our third party manufacturers on quality related matters while we monitor their compliance with fda regulations and perform periodic audits to ensure such compliance 
this continual evaluation process ensures that our manufacturing processes and products are of the highest quality and in compliance with all known regulatory requirements 
when and if the fda chooses to audit a particular manufacturing facility  we are required to be notified immediately and updated on the progress of the audit as it proceeds 
if we or our manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulations  we could become subject to significant claims or penalties or be required to discontinue the sale of the non compliant product  which could have a material adverse effect our business  financial condition and results from operations 
in addition  the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant additional compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may also have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
most of our otc drug products are regulated pursuant to the fda s monograph system 
the monographs set out the active ingredients and labeling indications that are permitted for certain broad categories of otc drug products 
when the fda has finalized a particular monograph  it has concluded that a properly labeled product formulation is generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded 
a tentative final monograph indicates that the fda has not made a final determination about products in a category to establish safety and efficacy for a product and its uses 
however  unless there is a serious safety or efficacy issue  the fda typically will exercise enforcement discretion and permit companies to sell products conforming to a tentative final monograph until the final monograph is published 
products that comply with either final or tentative final monograph standards do not require pre market approval from the fda 
certain of our otc drug products are abbreviated new drug applications anda products and are manufactured and labeled in accordance with a fda approved submission 
these products are subject to reporting requirements as set forth in fda regulations 
certain of our otc healthcare products are medical devices which are regulated by the fda through a system which usually involves pre market clearance 
during the review process  the fda makes an affirmative determination as to the sufficiency of the label directions  cautions and warnings for the medical devices in question 
in accordance with the federal food  drug and cosmetic act fdc act and fda regulations  the company and its drug and device manufacturers must also comply with the fda s current good manufacturing practices gmps 
the fda inspects our facilities and those of our third party manufacturers periodically to determine that both the company and our third party manufacturers are complying with gmps 
a number of our products are regulated by the cpsc under the federal hazardous substances act the fhsa  the poison prevention packaging act of the pppa and the consumer products safety improvement act of the cpsia 
certain of our household products are considered to be hazardous substances under the fhsa and therefore require specific cautionary warnings to be included in their labeling for such products to be legally marketed 
in addition  a small number of our products are subject to regulation under the pppa and can only be legally marketed if they are dispensed in child resistant packaging or labeled for use in households where there are no children 
the cpsia requires us to make available to our customers certificates stating that we are in compliance with any applicable regulation administered by the cpsc 
certain of our household cleaning products are considered pesticides under the federal insecticide  fungicide  and rodenticide act fifra 
generally speaking  any substance intended for preventing  destroying  repelling  or mitigating any pest is considered to be a pesticide under fifra 
we market and distribute certain household products under our comet and spic and span brands which make antibacterial and or disinfectant claims governed by fifra 
due to the antibacterial and or disinfectant claims on certain of the comet and spic and span products  such products are considered to be pesticides under fifra and are required to be registered with the epa and contain certain disclosures on the product labels 
in addition  the contract manufacturers from which we source these products must be registered with the epa 
our comet and spic and span products that make antibacterial and or disinfectant claims are also subject to state regulations and the rules and regulations of the various jurisdictions where these products are sold 
other regulations we are also subject to a variety of other regulations in various foreign markets  including regulations pertaining to import export regulations and antitrust issues 
to the extent we decide to commence or expand operations in additional countries  we may be required to obtain an approval  license or certification from the country s ministry of health or comparable agency 
we must also comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that may vary from country to country 
government regulations in both our domestic and international markets can delay or prevent the introduction  or require the reformulation or withdrawal  of some of our products 
our failure to comply with these regulations can result in a product being removed from sale in a particular market  either temporarily or permanently 
in addition  we are subject to ftc and state regulations  as well as foreign regulations  relating to our product claims and advertising 
if we fail to comply with these regulations  we could be subject to enforcement actions and the imposition of penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
intellectual property we own a number of trademark registrations and applications in the united states  canada and other foreign countries 
the following are some of the most important registered trademarks we own in the united states and or canada chloraseptic  chore boy  cinch  clear eyes  comet  compound w  dermoplast  dramamine  efferdent  effergrip  freeze off  little remedies  longlast  luden  momentum  murine  nasalcrom  new skin  pediacare  percogesic  spic and span  the doctor s brushpicks  the doctor s nightguard  and wartner 
our trademarks and trade names are how we convey that the products we sell are brand name products 
our ownership of these trademarks and trade names is very important to our business as it allows us to compete based on the value and goodwill associated with these marks 
we may also license others to use these marks 
additionally  we own or license patents on innovative and proprietary technology 
such patents evidence the unique nature of our products  provide us with exclusivity and afford us protection from the encroachment of others 
none of our patents that we own or license  however  is material to us on a consolidated basis 
enforcing our rights  or the rights of any of our licensors  represented by these trademarks  trade names and patents is critical to our business  but is expensive 
if we are not able to effectively enforce our rights  others may be able to dilute our trademarks  trade names and patents and diminish the value associated with our brands and technologies  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
we do not own all of the intellectual property rights applicable to our products 
in those cases where our third party manufacturers own patents that protect our products  we are dependent on them as a source of supply for our products 
unless other non infringing technologies are available  we must continue to purchase patented products from our suppliers who sell patented products to us 
in addition  we rely on our suppliers for their enforcement of their intellectual property rights against infringing products 
we have licensed to the procter gamble company the right to use the comet  spic and span and chlorinol trademarks in the commercial institutional industrial segment in the united states and canada until we have also licensed to the procter gamble company the comet and chlorinol brands in russia and specified eastern european countries until seasonality the first quarter of our fiscal year typically has the lowest level of revenue due to the seasonal nature of certain of our brands relative to the summer and winter months 
in addition  the first quarter is the least profitable quarter due to the increased advertising and promotional spending to support those brands with a summer selling season  such as clear eyes products  compound w  wartner and new skin 
the increased level of advertising and promotional campaigns in the third quarter influence sales of our cough cold products such as chloraseptic  little remedies  luden and pediacare during the fourth quarter cough cold winter months 
additionally  the fourth quarter typically has the lowest level of advertising and promotional spending as a percent of revenue

item a 
risk factors the high level of competition in our industry  much of which comes from competitors with greater resources  could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results from operations 
the business of selling brand name consumer products in the otc healthcare and household cleaning categories is highly competitive 
these markets include numerous manufacturers  distributors  marketers and retailers that actively compete for consumers business both in the united states and abroad 
many of these competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do  and may therefore have the ability to spend more aggressively on research and development  advertising and marketing  and to respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions 
if this were to occur  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
certain of our product lines that account for a large percentage of our sales have a small market share relative to our competitors 
for example  while clear eyes has a number two market share position of within the allergy redness eye drop segment  its top competitor  visine  has a market share of in the same segment 
in contrast  certain of our brands with number two market positions have a similar market share relative to our competitors 
for example  compound w has a number two market position of and its top competitor  dr 
scholl s  has a market position of in the same category 
finally  while our new skin liquid bandage product has a number one market position of  the size of the liquid bandage market is relatively small  particularly when compared to the much larger bandage category 
see part i  item business section on page of this annual report on form k for information regarding market share calculations 
we compete for customers attention based on a number of factors  including brand recognition  product quality  performance  price and product availability at the retail level 
advertising  promotion  merchandising and packaging  the timing of new product introductions and line extensions also have a significant impact on consumer buying decisions and  as a result  on our sales 
the structure and quality of our sales force  as well as sell through of our products affect in store position  wall display space and inventory levels in retail stores 
if we are unable to maintain our current distribution network  inventory levels and in store positioning of our products at our customers  our sales and operating results will be adversely affected 
our markets also are highly sensitive to the introduction of new products  which may rapidly capture a significant share of the market 
an increase in the number of product innovations by our competitors or the failure of a new product launch by the company could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
in addition  competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by us 
competitive pricing may require us to reduce prices which may result in lost sales or a reduction of our profit margins 
future price adjustments  product changes or new product introductions by our competitors or our inability to react with price adjustments  product changes or new product introductions of our own could result in a loss of market share which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
we depend on a limited number of customers with whom we have no long term agreements for a large portion of our gross sales and the loss of one or more of these customers could reduce our gross sales and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for  our top five and ten customers accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our sales  compared with approximately and for and and for walmart  which itself accounted for approximately  and of our sales in  and  respectively  is our only customer that accounted for or more of our sales 
we expect that for future periods  our top five and ten customers  including walmart  will  in the aggregate  continue to account for a large portion of our sales 
the loss of one or more of our top customers  any significant decrease in sales to these customers  or a significant decrease in our retail display space in any of these customers stores  could reduce our sales and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
in addition  our business is based primarily upon individual sales orders 
we typically do not enter into long term contracts with our customers 
accordingly  our customers could cease buying products from us at any time and for any reason 
the fact that we do not have long term contracts with our customers means that we have no recourse in the event a customer no longer wants to purchase products from us 
if a significant number of our smaller customers  or any of our significant customers  elect not to purchase products from us  our business  financial condition and results from operations could be adversely affected 
our business has been and could continue to be adversely affected by a prolonged recession in the united states 
the economic uncertainty surrounding the current united states recession has affected and could continue to materially affect our business because such economic challenges could adversely affect consumers  our customers and suppliers 
specifically consumer spending may continue to be curtailed resulting in downward pressure on our sales  our customers may continue to rationalize the number of products that reach store shelves resulting in a reduction of the number of products that are carried at retail  particularly those that are not number one or two in their category  our customers may continue to reduce overall inventory levels to strengthen their working capital positions which could result in additional sales reductions for us during those periods that our customers implement such strategies  our customers may continue to increase the number and breadth of products that are sold via their private label to the detriment of our branded products  our customers may continue to rationalize store count  closing additional marginally performing stores resulting in sales reductions  potential working capital reductions  and an inability to repay amounts owed to us  and our suppliers may suffer from sales reductions which could diminish their working capital and impede their ability to provide product to us in a timely manner 
we depend on third party manufacturers to produce the products we sell 
if we are unable to maintain these manufacturing relationships or fail to enter into additional relationships  as necessary  we may be unable to meet customer demand and our sales and profitability could suffer as a result 
all of our products are produced by third party manufacturers 
our ability to retain our current manufacturing relationships and engage in and successfully transition to new relationships is critical to our ability to deliver quality products to our customers in a timely manner 
without adequate supplies of quality merchandise  sales would decrease materially and our business would suffer 
in the event that our primary third party manufacturers are unable or unwilling to ship products to us in a timely manner  we would have to rely on secondary manufacturing relationships or identify and qualify new manufacturing relationships 
we might not be able to identify or qualify such manufacturers for existing or new products in a timely manner and such manufacturers may not allocate sufficient capacity to us in order that we may meet our commitments to customers 
in addition  identifying alternative manufacturers without adequate lead times can compromise required product validation and stability protocol  which may involve additional manufacturing expense  delay in production or product disadvantage in the marketplace 
the consequences of not securing adequate and timely supplies of merchandise would negatively impact inventory levels  sales and gross margins  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
these manufacturers may also increase the cost of the products we purchase which could adversely affect our margins in the event we are unable to pass along these increased costs to our customers 
a situation such as this could also have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
at march   we had relationships with over third party manufacturers 
of those  we had long term contracts with manufacturers that produced items that accounted for approximately of our gross sales for each of and the fact that we do not have long term contracts with certain manufacturers means that they could cease manufacturing these products at any time and for any reason  or initiate arbitrary and costly price increases which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
price increases for raw materials  labor  energy and transportation costs could have an adverse impact on our margins 
the costs to manufacture and distribute our products are subject to fluctuation based on a variety of factors 
increases in commodity raw material including resins and packaging component prices and labor  energy and fuel costs could have a significant impact on our results from operations 
consequently  if we are unable to increase the price for our products or continue to achieve cost savings in a rising cost environment  such cost increases would reduce our gross margins and could have a material adverse effect on our results from operations 
if we increase the price for our products in order to maintain gross margins for our products  such increase may adversely affect demand for  and sales of  our products which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
disruption in our st 
louis distribution center may prevent us from meeting customer demand and our sales and profitability may suffer as a result 
we manage our product distribution in the continental united states through one primary distribution center in st 
louis  missouri 
a serious disruption  such as a flood or fire  to our primary distribution center could damage our inventory and could materially impair our ability to distribute our products to customers in a timely manner or at a reasonable cost 
we could incur significantly higher costs and experience longer lead times during the time required to reopen or replace our primary distribution center 
as a result  any serious disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
achievement of our strategic objectives requires the acquisition  or potentially the disposition  of certain brands or product lines 
efforts to effect and integrate such acquisitions or dispositions may divert our managerial resources away from our business operations 
the majority of our growth has been driven by acquiring other brands and companies 
at any given time  we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions that are intended to enhance our product portfolio  enable us to realize cost savings and further diversify our category  customer and channel focus 
our ability to successfully grow through acquisitions depends on our ability to identify  negotiate  complete and integrate suitable acquisition candidates and to obtain any necessary financing 
these efforts could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations 
if we complete acquisitions  we may also experience difficulties achieving  or an inability to achieve  our expected returns  difficulties in integrating any acquired companies  personnel and products into our existing business  delays in realizing the benefits of the acquired company or products  higher costs of integration than we anticipated  difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired business who are necessary to manage the business  difficulties in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies throughout our acquired companies  or adverse customer or stockholder reaction to the acquisition 
in addition  any acquisition could adversely affect our operating results as a result of higher interest costs from the acquisition related debt and higher amortization expenses related to the acquired intangible assets 
the diversion of management s attention to pursue acquisitions  or our failure to successfully integrate acquired companies into our business  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
in the event that we decide to sell a brand or product line  we may encounter difficulty finding  or be unable to find  a buyer on acceptable terms in a timely manner 
the pursuit of divestitures could divert management attention from our business operations and result in a delay in our efforts to achieve our strategic objectives 
our risks associated with doing business internationally increase as we expand our international footprint 
during  and  approximately  and  respectively  of our total revenues were attributable to our international business 
we generally rely on brokers and distributors for the sale of our products in foreign countries 
in addition to the risks associated with political instability  changes in the outlook for economic prosperity in these countries could adversely affect the sales of our products in these countries 
other risks of doing business internationally include changes in the legislative or regulatory requirements of the countries or regions where we do business  currency controls which restrict or prohibit the payment of funds or the repatriation of earnings to the united states  fluctuating foreign exchange rates could result in unfavorable increases in the price of our products or cause increases in the cost of certain products purchased from our foreign third party manufacturers  regulatory oversight and its impact on our ability to get products registered for sale in certain markets  potential trade restrictions and exchange controls  inability to protect our intellectual property rights in these markets  and increased costs of compliance with general business and tax regulations in these countries or regions 
regulatory matters governing our industry could have a significant negative effect on our sales and operating costs 
in both our united states and foreign markets  we are affected by extensive laws  governmental regulations  administrative determinations  court decisions and similar constraints 
such laws  regulations and other constraints exist at the federal  state or local levels in the united states and at analogous levels of government in foreign jurisdictions 
the formulation  manufacturing  packaging  labeling  distribution  importation  sale and storage of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies  including i the food and drug administration fda  ii the federal trade commission ftc  iii the consumer products safety commission cpsc  iv the environmental protection agency epa  and by v various agencies of the states  localities and foreign countries in which our products are manufactured  distributed  stored and sold 
if we or our third party manufacturers fail to comply with those regulations  we could become subject to enforcement actions  significant penalties or claims  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results from operations 
in addition  the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or the cessation of product sales and may adversely affect the marketing of our products  resulting in a significant loss of revenues which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
the fdc act and fda regulations require that the manufacturing processes of our third party manufacturers must also comply with the fda s gmp 
the fda inspects our facilities and those of our third party manufacturers periodically to determine if we and our third party manufacturers are complying with gmps 
a history of past compliance is not a guarantee that future gmps will not mandate other compliance steps and associated expense 
if we or our third party manufacturers fail to comply with applicable federal  state  local or foreign regulations  we could be required to suspend manufacturing operations  modify product formulations or processes  suspend the sale of products with non complying specifications  initiate product recalls  or change product labeling  packaging or advertising or take other corrective action 
any of the foregoing actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
in addition  our failure to comply with ftc or any other federal and state regulations  or with similar regulations in foreign markets  that cover our product claims and advertising  including direct claims and advertising by us  may result in enforcement actions and imposition of penalties or otherwise materially adversely affect the distribution and sale of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
product liability claims and related negative publicity could adversely affect our sales and operating results 
we may be required to pay for losses or injuries purportedly caused by our products 
from time to time we have been and may again be subjected to various product liability claims 
claims could be based on allegations that  among other things  our products contain contaminants  include inadequate instructions or warnings regarding their use or inadequate warnings concerning side effects and interactions with other substances 
any product liability claims may result in negative publicity that may adversely affect our sales and operating results 
also  if one of our products is found to be defective we may be required to recall it 
this may result in substantial costs and negative publicity which may adversely affect our sales and operating results 
although we maintain  and require our suppliers and third party manufacturers to maintain  product liability insurance coverage  potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or potential product liability claims may be excluded under the terms of the policy  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
in addition  in the future we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage or we may be required to pay higher premiums and accept higher deductibles in order to secure adequate insurance coverage 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our ability to compete effectively in the market for our products could be negatively impacted 
the market for our products depends to a significant extent upon the goodwill associated with our trademarks  trade names and patents 
our trademarks and trade names convey that the products we sell are brand name products 
we believe consumers ascribe value to our brands  some of which are over years old 
we own or license the material trademark  trade names and patents used in connection with the packaging  marketing and sale of our products 
these rights prevent our competitors or new entrants to the market from using our valuable brand names and technologies 
therefore  trademark  trade name and patent protection is critical to our business 
although most of our material intellectual property is registered in the united states and in applicable foreign countries  we may not be successful in asserting protection 
if we were to lose the exclusive right to use one or more of our intellectual property rights  the loss of such exclusive right could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
other parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and may thereby dilute the value of our brands in the marketplace 
brand dilution or the introduction of competitive brands could cause confusion in the marketplace and adversely affect the value that consumers associate with our brands  and thereby negatively impact our sales 
any such infringement of our intellectual property rights would also likely result in a commitment of our time and resources  financial or otherwise  to protect these rights through litigation or other means 
in addition  third parties may assert claims against our intellectual property rights and we may not be able to successfully resolve those claims causing us to lose our ability to use our intellectual property that is the subject of those claims 
such loss could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
furthermore  from time to time  we may be involved in litigation in which we are enforcing or defending our intellectual property rights which could require us to incur substantial fees and expenses and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
we license certain of our trademarks to third party licensees  who are bound by their respective license agreement to protect our trademarks from infringement and adhere to defined quality requirements 
if a licensee of our trademarks fails to adhere to the contractually defined quality requirements  our financial results could be negatively impacted if one of our brands suffers a substantial impairment to its reputation due to real or perceived quality issues 
further  if a licensee fails to protect one of our licensed trademarks from infringement  we might be required to take action 
virtually all of our assets consist of goodwill and intangibles 
as our financial statements indicate  virtually all of our assets consist of goodwill and intangibles  principally the trademarks  trade names and patents that we have acquired 
we recorded charges in and for impairment of those assets and in the event that the value of those assets become further impaired or our business is materially adversely affected in any way  we would not have tangible assets that could be sold to repay our liabilities 
as a result  our creditors and investors may not be able to recoup the amount of the indebtedness that they have extended to us or the amount they have invested in us 
we depend on third parties for intellectual property relating to some of the products we sell  and our inability to maintain or enter into future license agreements may result in our failure to meet customer demand  which would adversely affect our operating results 
we have licenses or manufacturing agreements with third parties that own intellectual property eg  formulae  copyrights  trademarks  trade dress  patents and other technology used in the manufacture and sale of certain of our products 
in the event that any such license or manufacturing agreement expires or is otherwise terminated  we will lose the right to use the intellectual property covered by such license or agreement and will have to develop or obtain rights to use other intellectual property 
similarly  our rights could be reduced if the applicable licensor or third party manufacturer fails to maintain or protect the licensed intellectual property because  in such event  our competitors could obtain the right to use the intellectual property without restriction 
if this were to occur  we might not be able to develop or obtain replacement intellectual property in a timely or cost effective manner 
additionally  any modified products may not be well received by customers 
the consequences of losing the right to use or having reduced rights to such intellectual property could negatively impact our sales due to our failure to meet consumer demand for the affected products or require us to incur costs for development of new or different intellectual property  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
in addition  development of replacement products may be time consuming and ultimately may not be feasible 
we depend on our key personnel and the loss of the services provided by any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business and results of operations 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior management  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
these employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time 
we may not be able to successfully retain existing personnel or identify  hire and integrate new personnel 
while we believe we have developed depth and experience among our key personnel  our business may be adversely affected if one or more of these key individuals were to leave 
we do not maintain any key man or similar insurance policies covering any of our senior management or key personnel 
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and the significant amount of cash we need to service our debt will not be available to reinvest in our business 
at march   our total indebtedness  including current maturities  is approximately million 
our indebtedness could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations toward repayment of our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the markets in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and limit  among other things  our ability to borrow additional funds on favorable terms or at all 
the terms of the indenture governing the senior notes and the credit agreement governing the senior credit facility allow us to issue and incur additional debt upon satisfaction of conditions set forth in the respective agreements 
if new debt is added to current debt levels  the related risks described above could increase 
at march   we had million of borrowing capacity available under the revolving credit facility to support our operating activities 
we also have the ability to borrow up to an additional million for acquisitions pursuant to our senior credit facility 
our operating flexibility is limited in significant respects by the restrictive covenants in our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes 
our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes impose restrictions that could impede our ability to enter into certain corporate transactions  as well as increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions by limiting our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in our business and industry 
these restrictions limit our ability to  among other things borrow money or issue guarantees  pay dividends  repurchase stock from or make other restricted payments to stockholders  make investments or acquisitions  use assets as security in other transactions  sell assets or merge with or into other companies  enter into transactions with affiliates  sell stock in our subsidiaries  and direct our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us 
our ability to engage in these types of transactions is generally limited by the terms of the senior credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes  even if we believe that a specific transaction would positively contribute to our future growth  operating results or profitability 
however  if we are able to enter into these types of transactions under the terms of the senior credit facility and the indenture  or if we obtain a waiver with respect to any specific transaction  that transaction may cause our indebtedness to increase  may not result in the benefits we anticipate or may cause us to incur greater costs or suffer greater disruptions in our business than we anticipate  and could therefore  have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
in addition  the senior credit facility requires us to maintain certain leverage and interest coverage ratios and not to exceed annual capital expenditures of million 
although we believe we can continue to meet and or maintain the financial covenants contained in our credit agreement  our ability to do so may be affected by events outside our control 
covenants in our senior credit facility also require us to use of the proceeds we receive from debt issuances to repay outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility 
any failure by us to comply with the terms and conditions of the credit agreement and the indenture governing the senior notes could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
the senior credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes contain cross default provisions that could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness 
the senior credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes contain provisions that allow the respective creditors to declare all outstanding borrowings under one agreement to be immediately due and payable as a result of a default under the other agreement 
consequently  under the senior credit facility  failure to make a payment required by the indenture governing the senior notes  among other things  may lead to an event of default under the senior credit facility 
similarly  an event of default or failure to make a required payment at maturity under the senior credit facility  among other things  may lead to an event of default under the indenture governing the senior notes 
if the debt under the senior credit facility and indenture governing the senior notes were to both be accelerated  the aggregate amount immediately due and payable as of march  would have been approximately million 
we presently do not have sufficient liquidity to repay these borrowings in the event they were to be accelerated  and we may not have sufficient liquidity in the future to do so 
additionally  we may not be able to borrow money from other lenders to enable us to refinance the indebtedness 
at march   the book value of our current assets was million 
although the book value of our total assets was  million  approximately million was in the form of intangible assets  including goodwill of million  a significant portion of which is illiquid and may not be available to satisfy our creditors in the event our debt is accelerated 
any failure to comply with the restrictions of the senior credit facility  the indenture governing the senior notes or any other subsequent financing agreements may result in an event of default 
such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt  as well as any other debt to which the cross acceleration or cross default provisions apply 
in addition  the lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply us with additional funding 
as a result  any default by us under our credit agreement  indenture governing the senior notes or any other financing agreement  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
litigation may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees  customers  consumers  suppliers  stockholders or others through private actions  class actions  administrative proceedings  regulatory actions or other litigation 
the outcome of litigation  particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions  is difficult to assess or quantify 
plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts  and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time 
the cost to defend current and future litigation may be significant 
there may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease customer acceptance of our products  regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable 
conversely  we may be required to initiate litigation against others to protect the value of our intellectual property and the goodwill associated therewith or enforce an agreement or contract that has been breached 
these matters are extremely time consuming and expensive  but absolutely necessary to maintain enterprise value  protect our assets and realize the benefits of the agreements and contracts that we have negotiated and safeguard our future 
as a result  litigation may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the trading price of our common stock may be volatile 
the trading price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to several factors  some of which are beyond our control  including i general stock market volatility  ii variations in our quarterly operating results  iii our leveraged financial position  iv potential sales of additional shares of our common stock  v perceptions associated with the identification of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting  vi general trends in the consumer products industry  vii changes by securities analysts in their estimates or investment ratings  viii the relative illiquidity of our common stock  ix voluntary withdrawal or recall of products  x news regarding litigation in which we are or become involved  and xi general marketplace conditions brought on by economic recession 
we have no current intention of paying dividends to holders of our common stock 
we presently intend to retain our earnings  if any  for use in our operations  to facilitate strategic acquisitions  or to repay our outstanding indebtedness and have no current intention of paying dividends to holders of our common stock 
in addition  our debt instruments limit our ability to declare and pay cash dividends on our common stock 
as a result  your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in our common stock will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and you sell your shares at a profit 
our annual and quarterly results from operations may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  resulting in a decline in the price of our securities 
our annual and quarterly results from operations may fluctuate significantly because of several factors  including increases and decreases in average quarterly revenues and profitability  the rate at which we make acquisitions or develop new products and successfully market them  our inability to increase the sales of our existing products and expand their distribution  adverse regulatory or market events in our international markets  litigation matters  changes in consumer preferences  spending habits and competitive conditions  including the effects of competitors operational  promotional or expansion activities  seasonality of our products  fluctuations in commodity prices  product costs  utilities and energy costs  prevailing wage rates  insurance costs and other costs  our ability to recruit  train and retain qualified employees  and the costs associated with those activities  changes in advertising and promotional activities and expansion to new markets  negative publicity relating to us and the products we sell  unanticipated increases in infrastructure costs  impairment of goodwill or long lived assets  changes in interest rates  and changes in accounting  tax  regulatory or other rules applicable to our business 
our quarterly operating results and revenues may fluctuate as a result of any of these or other factors 
accordingly  results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year  and revenues for any particular future period may decrease 
in the future  operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in that event  the market price of our outstanding securities could be adversely impacted 
we can be adversely affected by the implementation of new  or changes in the interpretation of existing  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
our financial reporting complies with gaap which is subject to change over time 
if new rules or interpretations of existing rules require us to change our financial reporting  our financial condition and results from operations could be adversely affected 
identification of a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting may adversely affect our financial results 
we are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the regulations promulgated thereunder 
those provisions provide for the identification and reporting of material weaknesses in our system of internal controls over financial reporting 
if such a material weakness is identified  it could indicate a lack of controls adequate to generate accurate financial statements 
we routinely assess our internal controls over financial reporting  but we cannot assure you that we will be able to timely remediate any material weaknesses that may be identified in future periods  or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance 
likewise  we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel  especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies 
provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and delaware law may discourage potential acquirers of our company  which could adversely affect the value of our securities 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our board of directors is authorized to issue from time to time  without further stockholder approval  up to million shares of preferred stock in one or more series of preferred stock issuances 
our board of directors may establish the number of shares to be included in each series of preferred stock and determine  as applicable  the voting and other powers  designations  preferences  rights  qualifications  limitations and restrictions for such series of preferred stock 
the shares of preferred stock could have preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation rights 
we may issue additional preferred stock in ways which may delay  defer or prevent a change in control of the company without further action by our stockholders 
the shares of preferred stock may be issued with voting rights that may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock by increasing the number of outstanding shares having voting rights  and by the creation of class or series voting rights 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  as amended  contains additional provisions that may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire or attempt to acquire control of our company 
in addition  we are subject to certain provisions of delaware law that limit  in some cases  our ability to engage in certain business combinations with significant stockholders 
these provisions  either alone  or in combination with each other  give our current directors and executive officers the ability to significantly influence the outcome of a proposed acquisition of the company 
these provisions would apply even if an acquisition or other significant corporate transaction was considered beneficial by some of our stockholders 
if a change in control or change in management is delayed or prevented by these provisions  the market price of our outstanding securities could be adversely impacted

trutek arbitration on november   trutek corp 
trutek commenced an arbitration proceeding against prestige brands  inc prestige brands  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  in which trutek alleged that prestige brands breached certain terms of a license agreement between trutek and prestige brands providing for the license of certain intellectual property by trutek to prestige brands for an allergy relief product 
prestige brands has denied trutek allegations of breach of the license agreement 
discovery in the arbitration is ongoing and a hearing is scheduled to occur in october in addition to the matters described above  we are involved from time to time in other routine legal matters and other claims incidental to our business 
we review outstanding claims and proceedings internally and with external counsel as necessary to assess probability and amount of potential loss 
these assessments are re evaluated at each reporting period and as new information becomes available to determine whether a reserve should be established or if any existing reserve should be adjusted 
the actual cost of resolving a claim or proceeding ultimately may be substantially different than the amount of the recorded reserve 
in addition  because it is not permissible under gaap to establish a litigation reserve until the loss is both probable and estimable  in some cases there may be insufficient time to establish a reserve prior to the actual incurrence of the loss upon verdict and judgment at trial  for example  or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement 
we believe the resolution of routine matters and other incidental claims  taking into account reserves and insurance  will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results from operations

general we are engaged in the marketing  sales and distribution of brand name over the counter otc healthcare and household cleaning products to mass merchandisers  drug stores  supermarkets and dollar and club stores primarily in the united states and canada 
we continue to use the strength of our brands  our established retail distribution network  a low cost operating model and our experienced management team as a competitive advantage to grow our presence in these categories and  as a result  grow our sales and profits 
we have grown our brand portfolio by acquiring strong and well recognized brands from larger consumer products and pharmaceutical companies  as well as other brands from smaller private companies 
while the brands we have purchased from larger consumer products and pharmaceutical companies have long histories of support and brand development  we believe that at the time we acquired them they were considered non core by their previous owners and did not benefit from the focus of senior level management or strong marketing support 
we believe that the brands we have purchased from smaller private companies have been constrained by the limited resources of their prior owners 
after acquiring a particular brand  we seek to increase its sales  market share and distribution in both existing and new channels 
we pursue this growth through increased spending on advertising and promotion  new marketing strategies  improved packaging and formulations and innovative new products 
acquisitions blacksmith acquisition on november   we acquired of the capital stock of blacksmith brands holdings  inc blacksmith for million in cash  plus a working capital adjustment of million and an additional million was paid by us on behalf of blacksmith for the seller transaction costs 
the working capital adjustment is among a number of items that we are challenging related to the purchase price 
in connection with this acquisition  we acquired five leading consumer otc brands efferdent  effergrip  pediacare  luden  and nasalcrom 
the primary reason we acquired these brands was to expand our brand offerings and complement our existing otc brands 
we expect that the acquisition of these five brands will enhance our position in the otc market 
additionally  we believe that these newly acquired brands will benefit from a targeted advertising and marketing program  as well as our business model of outsourcing manufacturing and the elimination of redundant operations 
the purchase price was funded by cash provided by the issuance of long term debt and additional bank borrowings  which are discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the acquisition was accounted for in accordance with the business combinations topic of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc which requires that the total cost of an acquisition be allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values at the date of acquisition 
the allocation of the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on valuations which we performed to determine the fair value of such assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date 
the following table summarizes our allocation of the million purchase price to the assets we acquired and liabilities we assumed in the blacksmith acquisition in thousands cash acquired accounts receivable  net other receivables income taxes receivable inventories prepaids and other current assets property  plant and equipment  net goodwill trademarks other long term assets total assets acquired accounts payable accrued expenses income taxes payable deferred income taxes total liabilities assumed total purchase price transaction and other costs associated with the blacksmith acquisition of million are included in general and administrative expenses in our statement of operations for we recorded goodwill based on the amount by which the purchase price exceeded the fair value of net assets acquired 
the amount of goodwill deductible for tax purposes is million 
the fair value of the trademarks is comprised of million of non amortizable intangible assets and million of amortizable intangible assets 
we are amortizing the purchased amortizable intangible assets on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of years 
the weighted average remaining life for the amortizable intangible assets at march  was years 
the operating results of blacksmith have been included in our consolidated financial statements from november   the date of acquisition 
revenues of the acquired operations from november  through march  were million and the net loss was million 
dramamine asset acquisition on january   we acquired certain assets comprising the dramamine brand in the united states 
the purchase price was million in cash  after a million post closing inventory adjustment and including transaction costs incurred in the acquisition of million 
the primary reason to acquire the dramamine brand was to expand our brand offerings and complement our existing otc brands 
the purchase price was funded by cash on hand 
the acquisition was accounted for in accordance with the business combinations topic of the asc 
accordingly  as the dramamine assets acquired do not constitute a business  as defined in the asc  we have accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition 
the total consideration paid  including transaction costs  have been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired based upon their relative fair values at the date of acquisition 
the allocation of the purchase price to assets acquired assumed is based on valuations  which we performed to determine the fair value of such assets as of the acquisition date 
the following table summarizes our allocation of the million purchase price to the assets we acquired comprising the assets of the dramamine brand in thousands inventories trademark total purchase price the million fair value of the acquired dramamine trademark was comprised of non amortizable intangible assets 
discontinued operations and sale of certain assets on september   we sold certain assets related to the cutex nail polish remover brand for million 
in accordance with the discontinued operations topic of the asc  we reclassified the related assets as discontinued in the consolidated balance sheet as of march  and reclassified the related operating results as discontinued in the consolidated financial statements and related notes for all periods presented 
we recognized a loss of million on a pre tax basis and million net of related tax effects of million on the sale in as a result of the divestiture of cutex  which comprised a substantial majority of the assets in our previously reported personal care segment  we reclassified the remaining assets to the otc healthcare segment 
in october  we sold certain assets related to the shampoo brands 
in accordance with the discontinued operations topic of the asc  we reclassified the related operating results as discontinued in the consolidated financial statements and related notes for all periods presented 
we recognized a gain of million on a pre tax basis and million net of related tax effects of million on the sale in the total sales price for the assets was million  subject to an inventory adjustment  with million received upon closing 
we received the remaining million in october the following table presents the assets related to the discontinued operations as of march  in thousands inventory intangible assets total assets of discontinued operations the following table summarizes the results of discontinued operations in thousands year ended march  components of income revenues income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
while all significant accounting policies are important to our consolidated financial statements  certain of these policies may be viewed as being critical 
such policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results from operations and require our most difficult  subjective and complex estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses or the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates are based upon our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
the most critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the following revenue recognition criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii the product has been shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes the risk of loss  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  and iv collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we have determined that the transfer of risk of loss generally occurs when product is received by the customer  and  accordingly recognize revenue at that time 
provision is made for estimated discounts related to customer payment terms and estimated product returns at the time of sale based on our historical experience 
as is customary in the consumer products industry  we participate in the promotional programs of our customers to enhance the sale of our products 
the cost of these promotional programs is recorded as advertising and promotional expenses or as a reduction of sales based upon the nature of such items and the applicable accounting guidance 
such costs vary from period to period based on the actual number of units sold during a finite period of time 
we estimate the cost of such promotional programs at their inception based on historical experience and current market conditions and reduce sales by such estimates 
these promotional programs consist of direct to consumer incentives such as coupons and temporary price reductions  as well as incentives to our customers  such as allowances for new distribution  including slotting fees  and cooperative advertising 
direct reimbursements of advertising costs are reflected as a reduction of advertising costs in the periods in which the reimbursement criteria are achieved 
we do not provide incentives to customers for the acquisition of product in excess of normal inventory quantities since such incentives would increase the potential for future returns  as well as reduce sales in the subsequent fiscal periods 
estimates of costs of promotional programs are based on i historical sales experience  ii the current offering  iii forecasted data  iv current market conditions  and v communication with customer purchasing marketing personnel 
at the completion of the promotional program  the estimated amounts are adjusted to actual results 
our related promotional expense for was million 
we participated in over six thousand promotional campaigns  resulting in an average cost of less than five thousand dollars per campaign 
of such amount  only approximately one thousand payments were in excess of five thousand dollars 
we believe that the estimation methodologies employed  combined with the nature of the promotional campaigns  make the likelihood remote that our obligation would be misstated by a material amount 
however  for illustrative purposes  had we underestimated the promotional program rate by for  our sales and operating income would have been reduced by approximately million 
net income would have been adversely affected by approximately million 
we also periodically run coupon programs in sunday newspaper inserts or as on package instant redeemable coupons 
we utilize a national clearing house to process coupons redeemed by customers 
at the time a coupon is distributed  a provision is made based upon historical redemption rates for that particular product  information provided as a result of the clearing house s experience with coupons of similar dollar value  the length of time the coupon is valid  and the seasonality of the coupon drop  among other factors 
during  we had coupon events 
the amount recorded against revenues and accrued for these events during the year was million 
cash settlement of coupon redemptions during the year was million 
allowances for product returns due to the nature of the consumer products industry  we are required to estimate future product returns 
accordingly  we record an estimate of product returns concurrent with the recording of sales 
such estimates are made after analyzing i historical return rates  ii current economic trends  iii changes in customer demand  iv product acceptance  v seasonality of our product offerings  and vi the impact of changes in product formulation  packaging and advertising 
we construct our returns analysis by looking at the previous year s return history for each brand 
subsequently  each month  we estimate our current return rate based upon an average of the previous six months return rate and review that calculated rate for reasonableness giving consideration to the other factors described above 
our historical return rate has been relatively stable  for example  for the years ended march   and  returns represented  and  respectively  of gross sales 
at march  and  the allowance for sales returns was million and million  respectively 
while we utilize the methodology described above to estimate product returns  actual results may differ materially from our estimates  causing our future financial results to be adversely affected 
among the factors that could cause a material change in the estimated return rate would be significant unexpected returns with respect to a product or products that comprise a significant portion of our revenues 
based upon the methodology described above and our actual returns experience  management believes the likelihood of such an event remains remote 
as noted  over the last three years our actual product return rate has stayed within a range of to of gross sales 
a hypothetical increase of in our estimated return rate as a percentage of gross sales would have decreased our reported sales and operating income for by approximately million 
net income would have been reduced by approximately million 
lower of cost or market for obsolete and damaged inventory we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market value 
accordingly  we reduce our inventories for the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence  damage or other issues affecting marketability equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value 
factors utilized in the determination of estimated market value include i current sales data and historical return rates  ii estimates of future demand  iii competitive pricing pressures  iv new product introductions  v product expiration dates  and vi component and packaging obsolescence 
many of our products are subject to expiration dating 
as a general rule our customers will not accept goods with expiration dating of less than months from the date of delivery 
to monitor this risk  management utilizes a detailed compilation of inventory with expiration dating between zero and months and reserves for of the cost of any item with expiration dating of months or less 
inventory obsolescence costs charged to operations for   and were million  million and million respectively  or  and  respectively  of net sales 
a hypothetical increase of in our allowance for obsolescence at march  would have decreased our reported operating income and net income for by approximately million and million  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts in the ordinary course of business  we grant non interest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable which is based upon our historical collection experience and expected collectibility of the accounts receivable 
in an effort to reduce our credit risk  we i establish credit limits for all of our customer relationships  ii perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition  iii monitor the payment history and aging of our customers receivables  and iv monitor open orders against an individual customer s outstanding receivable balance 
we establish specific reserves for those accounts which file for bankruptcy  have no payment activity for days or have reported major negative changes to their financial condition 
the allowance for bad debts amounted to and of accounts receivable at march  and  respectively 
bad debt expense in each of the years  and was million  representing of net sales for each of  and while management believes that it is diligent in its evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  an unexpected event  such as the bankruptcy filing of a major customer  could have an adverse effect on our future financial results 
a hypothetical increase of in our bad debt expense as a percentage of sales in would have resulted in a decrease in reported operating income of approximately million  and a decrease in our reported net income of approximately million 
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill goodwill and intangible assets amounted to million and million at march  and  respectively 
at march  and  goodwill and intangible assets were apportioned among our two operating segments as follows march  march  over the counter healthcare household cleaning consolidated over the counter healthcare household cleaning consolidated in thousands goodwill intangible assets indefinite lived finite lived the increase in goodwill of million for was due to the blacksmith acquisition 
the increase in the indefinite lived intangible assets of million for was due to the blacksmith acquisition of million and the dramamine acquisition of million 
the decrease in the finite lived intangible assets of million was due to amortization of million offset by a million addition due to the blacksmith acquisition 
our chloraseptic  clear eyes  compound w  dramamine  efferdent  luden and pediacare brands comprise the majority of the value of the intangible assets within the otc healthcare segment 
the chore boy  comet and spic and span brands comprise substantially all of the intangible asset value within the household cleaning segment 
goodwill and intangible assets comprise substantially all of our assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a purchase business combination 
intangible assets generally represent our trademarks  brand names and patents 
when we acquire a brand  we are required to make judgments regarding the value assigned to the associated intangible assets  as well as their respective useful lives 
we consider many factors  both prior to and after  the acquisition of an intangible asset in determining the value  as well as the useful life  assigned to each intangible asset that we acquire or continue to own and promote 
the most significant factors are brand history a brand that has been in existence for a long period of time eg   or years generally warrants a higher valuation and longer life sometimes indefinite than a brand that has been in existence for a very short period of time 
a brand that has been in existence for an extended period of time generally has been the subject of considerable investment by its previous owner s to support product innovation and advertising and promotion 
market position consumer products that rank number one or two in their respective market generally have greater name recognition and are known as quality product offerings  which warrant a higher valuation and longer life than products that lag in the marketplace 
recent and projected sales growth recent sales results present a snapshot as to how the brand has performed in the most recent time periods and represent another factor in the determination of brand value 
in addition  projected sales growth provides information about the strength and potential longevity of the brand 
a brand that has both strong current and projected sales generally warrants a higher valuation and a longer life than a brand that has weak or declining sales 
similarly  consideration is given to the potential investment  in the form of advertising and promotion  which is required to reinvigorate a brand that has fallen from favor 
history of and potential for product extensions consideration also is given to the product innovation that has occurred during the brand s history and the potential for continued product innovation that will determine the brand s future 
brands that can be continually enhanced by new product offerings generally warrant a higher valuation and longer life than a brand that has always followed the leader 
after consideration of the factors described above  as well as current economic conditions and changing consumer behavior  management prepares a determination of the intangible s value and useful life based on management analysis 
under accounting guidelines goodwill is not amortized  but must be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below the carrying amount 
in a similar manner  indefinite lived assets are not amortized 
they are also subject to an annual impairment test  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired 
additionally  at each reporting period an evaluation must be made to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and must also be tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
on an annual basis  during the fourth fiscal quarter  or more frequently if conditions indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered  management performs a review of both the values and  if applicable  useful lives assigned to goodwill and intangible assets and tests for impairment 
we report goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in two operating segments otc healthcare and household cleaning 
we identify our reporting units in accordance with the fasb accounting standards codification subtopic  which is at the brand level  and one level below the operating segment level 
the carrying value and fair value for intangible assets and goodwill for a reporting unit are calculated based on key assumptions and valuation methodologies previously discussed 
as a result  any material changes to these assumptions could require us to record additional impairment in the future 
goodwill as of march   we had nine reporting units with goodwill 
the aggregate fair value exceeded the carrying value by 
no individual reporting unit fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than  except for two reporting units in the otc healthcare segment 
one reporting unit fair value exceeded the carrying value by and the associated goodwill amounted to million 
the second reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by and the associated goodwill amounted to million 
as part of our annual test for impairment of goodwill  management estimates the discounted cash flows of each reporting unit  which is at the brand level  and one level below the operating segment level  to estimate their respective fair values 
in performing this analysis  management considers the same types of information as listed above in regards to finite lived intangible assets 
in the event that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  management would then be required to allocate the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the unit was acquired in a business combination  thereby revaluing the carrying amount of goodwill 
in a manner similar to indefinite lived assets  future events  such as competition  technological advances and reductions in advertising support for our trademarks and trade names could cause subsequent evaluations to utilize different assumptions 
indefinite lived intangible assets in a manner similar to finite lived intangible assets  at each reporting period  management analyzes current events and circumstances to determine whether the indefinite life classification for a trademark or trade name continues to be valid 
if circumstances warrant a change to a finite life  the carrying value of the intangible asset would then be amortized prospectively over the estimated remaining useful life 
the economic events experienced during  as well as our plans and projections for our brands  indicated that several of our brands could no longer support indefinite useful lives 
each of these brands incurred an impairment charge during the three month period ended march  and was adversely affected by increased competition 
consequently  at april   we reclassified million of previously indefinite lived intangibles to intangibles with definite lives 
we estimate the useful lives of these intangibles to be years 
the carrying value and the annual amortization charges of the reclassified intangibles are as follows in thousands carrying value as of march  annual amortization household cleaning trademarks otc healthcare trademarks management tests the indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the intangible asset to its estimated fair value 
since quoted market prices are seldom available for trademarks and trade names such as ours  we utilize present value techniques to estimate fair value 
accordingly  management s projections are utilized to assimilate all of the facts  circumstances and expectations related to the trademark or trade name and estimate the cash flows over its useful life 
in performing this analysis  management considers the same types of information as listed above in regard to finite lived intangible assets 
once that analysis is completed  a discount rate is applied to the cash flows to estimate fair value 
future events  such as competition  technological advances and reductions in advertising support for our trademarks and trade names could cause subsequent evaluations to utilize different assumptions 
finite lived intangible assets as mentioned above  when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable  management performs a review to ascertain the impact of events and circumstances on the estimated useful lives and carrying values of our trademarks and trade names 
in connection with this analysis  management reviews period to period sales and profitability by brand  analyzes industry trends and projects brand growth rates  prepares annual sales forecasts  evaluates advertising effectiveness  analyzes gross margins  reviews contractual benefits or limitations  monitors competitors advertising spend and product innovation  prepares projections to measure brand viability over the estimated useful life of the intangible asset  and considers the regulatory environment  as well as industry litigation 
if analysis of any of the aforementioned factors warrants a change in the estimated useful life of the intangible asset  management will reduce the estimated useful life and amortize the carrying value prospectively over the shorter remaining useful life 
management s projections are utilized to assimilate all of the facts  circumstances and expectations related to the trademark or trade name and estimate the cash flows over its useful life 
in the event that the long term projections indicate that the carrying value is in excess of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the intangible assets  management is required to record an impairment charge 
once that analysis is completed  a discount rate is applied to the cash flows to estimate fair value 
the impairment charge is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the intangible asset over fair value as calculated using the discounted cash flow analysis 
future events  such as competition  technological advances and reductions in advertising support for our trademarks and trade names could cause subsequent evaluations to utilize different assumptions 
impairment analysis we estimate the fair value of our intangible assets and goodwill using a discounted cash flow method 
this discounted cash flow methodology is a widely accepted valuation technique utilized by market participants in the valuation process and has been applied consistently with prior periods 
in addition  we considered our market capitalization at march   as compared to the aggregate fair values of our reporting units to assess the reasonableness of our estimates pursuant to the discounted cash flow methodology 
as a result of our analysis  we did not record an impairment charge in during the three month period ended march   we recorded a million non cash impairment charge to goodwill related to the cutex brand  which was sold on september  and is included in the loss from discontinued operations for the impairment was the result of distribution losses and increased competition from private label store brands 
during the fourth quarter ended march   as a direct consequence of the challenging economic environment  the dislocation of the debt and equity markets  and contracting consumer demand for our branded products  we recorded a non cash charge in the amount of million related to the impairment of intangible assets and goodwill across the entire product line because the carrying amount of these branded assets exceeded their respective fair values 
a summary of the impairment activity by segment for is as follows otc healthcare household cleaning consolidated in thousands goodwill impairment intangible assets impairment indefinite lived finite lived the discount rate utilized in the analyses  as well as future cash flows may be influenced by such factors as changes in interest rates and rates of inflation 
additionally  should the related fair values of goodwill and intangible assets continue to be adversely affected as a result of declining sales or margins caused by competition  changing consumer preferences  technological advances or reductions in advertising and promotional expenses  we may be required to record additional impairment charges in the future 
stock based compensation the compensation and equity topics of the fasb asc require us to measure the cost of services to be rendered based on the grant date fair value of the equity award 
compensation expense is to be recognized over the period that an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  generally referred to as the requisite service period 
information utilized in the determination of fair value includes the following type of instrument ie  restricted shares vs 
an option  warrant or performance shares  strike price of the instrument  market price of our common stock on the date of grant  discount rates  duration of the instrument  and volatility of our common stock in the public market 
additionally  management must estimate the expected attrition rate of the recipients to enable it to estimate the amount of non cash compensation expense to be recorded in our financial statements 
while management uses diligent analysis to estimate the respective variables  a change in assumptions or market conditions  as well as changes in the anticipated attrition rates  could have a significant impact on the future amounts recorded as non cash compensation expense 
we recorded net non cash compensation expense of million  million and million during  and  respectively 
during and  performance goals related to certain restricted stock grants were met and recorded accordingly 
however  during  management was required to reverse previously recorded stock based compensation costs of million and million related to the may and grants  respectively  as it was determined that we would not meet the performance goals associated with such grants of restricted stock 
assuming no changes in assumptions and no new awards authorized by the compensation committee of the board of directors  we expect to record non cash compensation expense of approximately million during we did not issue any additional stock based compensation grants to date subsequent to march  loss contingencies loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such loss is reasonably estimable 
contingent losses are often resolved over longer periods of time and involve many factors including rules and regulations promulgated by regulatory agencies  sufficiency of the evidence in support of our position  anticipated costs to support our position  and likelihood of a positive outcome 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued guidance regarding the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
under the asc intangibles goodwill and other topics  testing for goodwill impairment is a two step test 
when a goodwill impairment test is performed either on an annual or interim basis  an entity must assess whether the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value step 
if it does  an entity must perform an additional test to determine whether goodwill has been impaired and to calculate the amount of that impairment step 
the new guidance modifies step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
the qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance and examples  which require that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is not permitted 
we do not expect that the adoption of this new guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued guidance regarding disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
this guidance specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the guidance also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
this guidance is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our footnote disclosures for our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued authoritative guidance requiring new disclosures and clarifying some existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurement 
under the new guidance  a reporting entity should a disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers  and b present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we have reviewed and continue to monitor the actions of the various financial and regulatory reporting agencies and are currently not aware of any other pronouncement that could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

the acquired blacksmith business generated i million in cash which resulted from a corresponding decrease in accounts receivable  due to receipt of payments from customers whose payment terms were extended by blacksmith prior to the acquisition  and ii million in inventory due to higher than normal inventory levels at the time of acquisition 
additionally  accrued liabilities increased primarily due to increased incentive compensation accruals and an increase in interest payable resulting from debt financing changes further described in the financing activities section below

the libor rate option contains a floor rate of 
at march   an aggregate of million was outstanding under the senior secured credit facility at an interest rate of 
at times  we utilize derivative financial instruments to mitigate the impact of changing interest rates associated with our long term debt obligations 
although we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes  all of our derivatives are straightforward over the counter instruments with liquid markets 
the notional  or contractual  amount of our derivative financial instruments is used to measure the amount of interest to be paid or received and does not represent an actual liability 
we account for these financial instruments as cash flow hedges 
in february  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in the notional amount of million  decreasing to million at march  to replace and supplement the interest rate cap agreement that expired on may  under that swap agreement  we agreed to pay a fixed rate of while receiving a variable rate based on libor

in march  we made repayments against outstanding indebtedness of million in excess of scheduled maturities 
in accordance with agreement governing the senior term loans  such payment was applied against the first four required principal payments  and any remaining principal payment is applied ratably toward the remaining required principal payments 
as such  we do not have a required principal payment in commitments as of march   we had ongoing commitments under various contractual and commercial obligations as follows payments due by period in millions less than to to after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt interest on long term debt purchase obligations inventory costs other costs operating leases total contractual cash obligations represents the estimated interest obligations on the outstanding balances of the term loan facility and senior notes  together  assuming scheduled principal payments based on the terms of the loan agreements are made and assuming a weighted average interest rate of

purchase obligations for other costs are legally binding commitments for marketing  advertising and capital expenditures 
activity costs for molds and equipment to be paid  based solely on a per unit basis without any deadlines for final payment  have been excluded from the table because we are unable to determine the time period over which such activity costs will be paid 
we have excluded fin obligations because we cannot reasonably estimate when they will occur

inflation inflationary factors such as increases in the costs of raw materials  packaging materials  purchased product and overhead may adversely affect our operating results

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates because our senior secured credit facility is variable rate debt 
interest rate changes generally do not affect the market value of the senior secured credit facility  but do affect the amount of our interest payments and  therefore  our future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
at march   we had variable rate debt of approximately million under our senior secured credit facility 
holding other variables constant  including levels of indebtedness  a one percentage point increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt would have an adverse impact on pre tax earnings and cash flows for the year ending march  of approximately million
