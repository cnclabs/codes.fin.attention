table of contents bermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to shareholders 
our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states 
as a bermuda company  we are governed by the companies act of bermuda companies act 
the companies act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to united states corporations and shareholders  including provisions relating to interested directors  mergers  amalgamations and acquisitions  takeovers  shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 
under bermuda law  the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only 
shareholders of bermuda companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company  and may only do so in limited circumstances 
directors and officers may owe duties to a company s creditors in cases of impending insolvency 
directors and officers of a bermuda company must  in exercising their powers and performing their duties  act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company and must exercise the care and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances 
directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests may conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any material contract or proposed material contract with the company or any of its subsidiaries 
if a director or officer of a bermuda company is found to have breached his duties to that company  he may be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty 
our bye laws provide for indemnification of our directors and officers in respect of any loss arising or liability attaching to them in respect of any negligence  default  breach of duty or breach of trust of which a director or officer may be guilty in relation to us other than in respect of his own fraud or dishonesty  which is the maximum extent of indemnification permitted under the companies act 
under our bye laws  each of our shareholders agrees to waive any claim or right of action  both individually and on our behalf  other than those involving fraud or dishonesty  against us or any of our officers  directors or employees 
the waiver applies to any action taken by a director  officer or employee  or the failure of such person to take any action  in the performance of his duties  except with respect to any matter involving any fraud or dishonesty on the part of the director  officer or employee 
this waiver limits the right of shareholders to assert claims against our directors  officers and employees unless the act or failure to act involves fraud or dishonesty 
legislative and other measures that may be taken by us and or other governmental authorities could materially increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial conditions  results of operations or cash flows 
under current laws  as the company is domiciled and tax resident in bermuda  taxation in other jurisdictions is dependent upon the types and the extent of the activities of the company undertaken in those jurisdictions 
there is a risk that changes in either the types of activities undertaken by the company or changes in tax rules relating to tax residency could subject the company and its shareholders to additional taxation 
we continue to assess the impact of various us federal and state legislative proposals  and modifications to existing tax treaties between the united states and foreign countries  that could result in a material increase in our us federal and state taxes 
proposals have been introduced in the us congress that  if ultimately enacted  could either limit treaty benefits on certain payments made by our us subsidiaries to non us affiliates  treat the company as a non us corporation and thereby subject the earnings from non us subsidiaries of the company to us taxation  or both 
we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals 
however  if such proposals were to be enacted  or if modifications were to be made to certain existing tax treaties  the consequences could have a materially adverse impact on the company  including increasing our tax burden  increasing costs of our tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
examinations and audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 
the company and its subsidiaries income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional income taxes will be due 
we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  however  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
we have anti takeover provisions in our bye laws that may discourage a change of control 
our bye laws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or to obtain majority representation on our board of directors without the consent of our board 
as a result  shareholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares under such circumstances

item legal proceedings in july  various closed end funds formerly advised by van kampen investments or morgan stanley investment management included in the acquired business had complaints filed against them in new york state court commencing derivative lawsuits purportedly brought on behalf of the common shareholders of those funds 
the funds are nominal defendants in these derivative lawsuits and the defendants also include van kampen investments acquired by invesco on june   morgan stanley investment management and certain officers and trustees of the funds who are or were employees of those firms 
invesco has certain obligations under the applicable acquisition agreement regarding the defense costs and any damages associated with this litigation 
the plaintiffs allege breaches of fiduciary duties owed by the non fund defendants to the funds common shareholders related to the funds redemption in prior periods of auction rate preferred securities arps theretofore issued by the funds 
the complaints are similar to other complaints recently filed against investment advisers  officers and trustees of closed end funds in other fund complexes which issued and redeemed arps 
the complaints allege that the advisers  distributors and certain officers and trustees of those funds breached their fiduciary duty by redeeming arps at their liquidation value when there was no obligation to do so and when the value of arps in the secondary marketplace were significantly below their liquidation value 
the complaints also allege that the arps redemptions were principally motivated by the fund sponsors interests to preserve distribution relationships with brokers and other financial intermediaries who held arps after having repurchased them from their own clients 
certain other funds included in the acquired business have received demand letters expressing similar allegations 
such demand letters could be precursors to additional similar lawsuits being commenced against those other funds 
the boards of trustees of the funds are evaluating the complaints and demand letters and have established special committees of independent trustees to conduct an inquiry regarding the allegations 
invesco believes the cases should be dismissed following completion of such review period  although there can be no assurance of that result 
invesco intends to defend vigorously any cases which may survive beyond initial motions to dismiss 
the investment management industry also is subject to extensive levels of ongoing regulatory oversight and examination 
in the united states and other jurisdictions in which the company operates  governmental authorities regularly make inquiries  hold investigations and administer market conduct examinations with respect to compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
additional lawsuits or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of these inquiries may in the future be filed against the company and related entities and individuals in the us and other jurisdictions in which the company and its affiliates operate 
any material loss of investor and or client confidence as a result of such inquiries and or litigation could result in a significant decline in assets under management  which would have an adverse effect on the company s future financial results and its ability to grow its business 
in the normal course of its business  the company is subject to various litigation matters 
although there can be no assurances  at this time management believes  based on information currently available to it  that it is not probable that the ultimate outcome of any of these actions will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the company

despite a number of challenges during the year  including the us equity market flash crash in may  the heightened risk of european sovereign default  and continued uncertainty about the strength of the economic recovery  most global equity markets achieved positive returns in marking the second year of recovery from the financial crisis as illustrated in the chart below line chart the response to these challenges by governments and central banks around the world of providing additional fiscal and monetary stimulus led to an investor environment that favored riskier assets as yields on less risky government bonds reached record lows 
as a result  most global equity markets achieved positive returns in with the s p climbing almost  the ftse rising  and the msci eafe index gaining nearly 
the exception was the equity market in japan which declined as the strength in the japanese yen  up almost against the us dollar in  negatively impacted the profits of japanese exporters and multinational corporations 
the table below summarizes the year ended december returns of several major market indices for   and year ended december  index s p ftse nikkei msci eafe 
table of contents both treasury markets and corporate credit markets achieved positive returns in as well 
treasury securities benefited from the combination of the flight to quality trade in the first half of the year  coinciding with the us equity market flash crash and increased risk of default by some european governments  as well as the federal reserve beginning the second round of quantitative easing  a process whereby the federal reserve creates new money to purchase treasury securities 
for the year  year treasury notes gained while shorter dated and year notes gained and respectively 
corporate credit markets benefited from improved fundamentals as earnings improved and corporations stockpiled cash 
further  the stimulus efforts from central bankers around the globe provided support as yields on government securities reached record lows  and fixed income investors moved out the credit risk curve in search of higher yields 
for the year  investment grade credit gained while high yield bonds returned 
invesco continued to make progress in a number of areas that better positioned our company as the markets continue their measured return to pre financial crisis levels
