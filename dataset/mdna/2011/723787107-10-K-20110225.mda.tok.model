mission and strategies the company s mission is to enhance shareholder investment returns through strategies that maximize pioneer s long term profitability and net asset value 
the strategies employed to achieve this mission are predicated on maintaining financial flexibility  capital allocation discipline and enhancing net asset value through accretive drilling programs  joint ventures and acquisitions 
these strategies are anchored by the company s interests in long lived spraberry oil field  the liquid rich eagle ford  barnett shale combo  hugoton and west panhandle fields  and the raton gas field  which together have an estimated remaining productive life in excess of years 
underlying these fields are approximately percent of the company s proved oil and gas reserves as of december  business activities the company is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company 
pioneer s purpose is to competitively and profitably explore for  develop and produce oil and gas reserves 
in so doing  the company sells homogenous oil  ngl and gas units that  except for geographic and relatively minor quality differences  cannot be significantly differentiated from units offered for sale by the company s competitors 
competitive advantage is gained in the oil and gas exploration and development industry by employing well trained and experienced personnel who make prudent capital investment decisions based on management direction  embrace technological innovation and are focused on price and cost management 
petroleum industry 
for several years preceding  the petroleum industry was generally characterized by volatile  but upward trending  oil  ngl and gas commodity prices 
during the first half of  north american gas prices increased as a result of reduced inventory levels  a perceived shortage of north american gas supply and anticipation that the united states would become a larger importer of lng  which was then selling in the world market at a substantial premium to united states gas prices 
however  by mid year  it became apparent that capital investments in gas drilling and discoveries of significant gas reserves in united states shale plays would cause domestic gas supply to exceed existing united states gas demand 
beginning in the second half of and continuing throughout most of  the united states and other industrialized countries experienced a significant economic slowdown  which 
table of contents led to a substantial decline in worldwide energy demand 
declining energy demand due to the economic slowdown  together with the increased supply of united states gas  resulted in sharp declines in oil  ngl and north american gas prices during the second half of and first half of during the second half of and throughout  economic stimulus initiatives implemented in the united states and worldwide served to stabilize economies and increase industry and consumer confidence 
while oil and ngl prices have steadily improved since the beginning of the second quarter of  gas prices have remained volatile throughout and as a result of increased gas supply and growing storage levels in the united states  which has offset the growth in demand 
the outlook for continuation of the worldwide economic recovery in is cautiously optimistic but remains uncertain  therefore  the sustainability of the recovery in worldwide demand for energy is difficult to predict 
as a result  the company believes it is likely that commodity prices  especially north american gas prices  will continue to be volatile during significant factors that will impact commodity prices include the ongoing impact of economic stimulus initiatives in the united states and worldwide in response to the worldwide economic decline  political and economic developments in north africa and the middle east  demand of asian and european markets  the extent to which members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec and other oil exporting nations are able to manage oil supply through export quotas  and overall north american gas supply and demand fundamentals 
pioneer uses commodity derivative contracts to mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility on the company s net cash provided by operating activities and its net asset value 
although the company has entered into derivative contracts on a large portion of its forecasted production through  a sustained lower commodity price environment would result in lower realized prices for unprotected volumes and reduce the prices at which the company could enter into derivative contracts on additional volumes in the future 
as a result  the company s internal cash flows would be reduced for affected periods 
a sustained decline in commodity prices could result in a shortfall in expected cash flows  which could negatively impact the company s liquidity  financial position and future results of operations
