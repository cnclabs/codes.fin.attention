table of contents year ended december  compared to consolidated net sales decreased in to billion from billion in this decrease was the result of lower year over year sales in the crane segment primarily due to the global macro economic downturn as well as continued weakness in the global credit markets 
sales in our crane segment decreased for the year ended december  compared to partially offsetting the lower crane net sales were higher sales in the foodservice segment as a result of additional revenue related to new product introductions  market share increase  and geographic penetration outpacing the market 
the weaker foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar had an unfavorable impact on consolidated net sales of approximately million or for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  further analysis of the changes in sales by segment is presented in the sales and operating earnings by segment section below 
gross profit decreased for the year ended december  to million compared to billion for the year ended december   a decrease of 
gross margin increased in to from in the decrease in consolidated gross profit was driven by the crane segment as a result of decreased sales volumes across most regions  increased unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs and an unfavorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes 
this decrease was partially offset by higher foodservice gross profit due to the increased sales and various cost reduction initiatives in both segments during the increase in gross margin occurred as a result of gross margin increases in the foodservice segment due to cost reductions  product sales mix and pricing actions 
engineering  selling and administrative es a expenses for the year ended december  decreased approximately million to million compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was driven by lower expenses in the crane segment as a result of controlled spending and collections of previously reserved receivable balances partially offset by higher foodservice segment es a expenses due to higher employee related costs  higher variable sales expenses and other discretionary spending 
amortization expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for see further detail related to the intangible assets at note  acquisitions 
restructuring expenses for the year ended december  totaled million  which compares to million in as a result of the continued worldwide decline in crane segment sales in  the company recorded million in restructuring charges as it further reduced the crane segment cost structure  primarily in france 
these charges were partially offset by the reversal of excess reserves of million due to improved outlook in other areas of the europe  middle east and africa emea region 
see further detail related to the restructuring expenses at note  restructuring 
interest expenses for the year ended december  totaled million versus million for the year ended december  the slight increase is the result of the issuance of higher interest rate senior notes issued during and an increase in the company s current senior credit facility senior credit facility interest pricing grid spread during the year substantially offset by lower total debt levels 
amortization expenses for deferred financing fees was million for the year ended december  as compared to million in the lower expense in is related to the early paydown of debt in and write off of a portion of the deferred financing fees in the loss on debt extinguishment  reducing the remaining fees to be amortized  which were only partially offset by the incurrence of new fees associated with the senior notes issued in the new fees are amortized over a significantly longer period than those associated with the new credit agreement 
the loss on debt extinguishment of million for the year ended december  is a result of the accelerated paydown of term loans a and b associated with the senior credit agreement 
cash from operations of million was used to pay down debt associated with the senior credit agreement 
other income  net for the year ended december  was a loss of million versus income of million for the prior year 
the loss in is primarily due to foreign currency losses related to inter company transactions between our us and foreign crane facilities during the year whereby the us dollar weakend against other foreign currencies and is also partially due to lower interest income 
the income in was primarily the result of foreign currency gains related to inter company transactions between our us and foreign crane facilities during the year whereby we benefitted from the us dollar strengthening against other foreign currencies and is also partially due to higher interest income 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was negative as compared to for the year ended december  as the company posted pre tax losses in and  a negative effective tax rate is an expense to the consolidated statement of operations  and a positive effective tax rate represents a benefit to the consolidated statement of operations 
the effective tax rate in was unfavorably impacted by the goodwill impairment of million which is non deductible for tax purposes 
both the and effective tax rates were favorably impacted by income earned in jurisdictions where the statutory rate was less than the education jobs and medicare assistance act was signed into law during the third quarter of and it contained provisions that impact the calculation of the foreign tax credit 
as a result  the company is no longer in a position to utilize its carry forward for this credit and recorded a valuation allowance in the third quarter of approximately million against the related deferred tax asset 
however  the 
table of contents company is able to amend its previously filed tax return and deduct these taxes paid  resulting in a tax benefit of million 
in addition  beginning with the third quarter of  foreign taxes paid in are being deducted as permitted  instead of credited 
in jurisdictions where the company operates its crane business  management analyzes the ability to utilize the deferred tax assets arising from net operating losses on a seven year cycle  consistent with the crane business cycles  as this provides the best information to evaluate the future profitability of the business units 
during  the company determined that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would potentially not be utilized in several jurisdictions including china  slovakia  spain  the uk and a portion of the wisconsin net operating loss 
the company continues to record valuation allowances on these deferred tax assets as it remains more likely than not that they will not be utilized 
the company recorded a full valuation allowance of million on the net deferred tax asset for net operating loss carryforwards in france during the fourth quarter of as the french operations moved into a seven year cumulative loss position in the fourth quarter and the company determined that the positive evidence supporting partial future realization of the asset was outweighed by the more objectively verifiable negative evidence 
the total valuation allowance adjustments of million in have an unfavorable impact to income tax expense 
during the third quarter of  the company recorded an adjustment to correct an error related to the provision for income taxes  whereby during the company had incorrectly understated the income tax benefit by million 
see additional discussions at note  company and basis of presentation

the company s income tax expense was unfavorably impacted by million for this law change 
the results from discontinued operations were a loss of million and a loss of million  net of income taxes  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the loss primarily relates to the classification of the kysor warren business as a discontinued operation 
the loss includes an impairment charge of million  net of income taxes  which was incurred to bring the carrying value of the associated net assets in line with the selling price  less costs to sell 
we also realized an after tax loss of million on the sale of the enodis ice businesses and the marine segment as a result of final settlement of working capital and tax adjustments in for the year ended december   a net loss attributable to a noncontrolling interest of million was recorded in relation to our partially owned affiliate with the shareholders of tai an dongyue heavy machinery co  ltd 
tai an dongyue 
there was a net loss of million in connection with the partially owned affiliate for the same period of see further detail related to the partially owned affiliate at note  acquisitions 
year ended december  compared to consolidated net sales decreased in to billion from billion in this decrease was the result of lower year over year sales in the crane segment primarily due to the global macro economic downturn as well as a broad global credit crisis in the banking industry 
partially offsetting the lower consolidated net sales was higher sales in the foodservice segment as a result of additional revenue related to businesses acquired in the enodis acquisition during the fourth quarter of sales in our crane segment decreased for the year ended december  compared to the weaker foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar had an unfavorable impact on consolidated net sales of approximately million or for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  further analysis of the changes in sales by segment is presented in the sales and operating earnings by segment section below 
gross profit decreased for the year ended december  to million compared to billion for the year ended december   a decrease of 
gross margin decreased in to from in the decrease in consolidated gross profit was driven by the crane segment as a result of decreased sales volumes across all regions  increased unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs and an unfavorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes 
this decrease was partially offset by higher foodservice gross profit due to the inclusion of enodis and various cost reduction initiatives in both segments during the decrease in gross margin occurred primarily as a result of lower sales volumes in the crane segment partially offset by higher gross margin in the foodservice segment due to cost reductions and pricing actions 
in addition  the strength in the us dollar resulted in a decrease in gross profit of approximately million or for the year ended december  engineering  selling and administrative es a expenses for the year ended december  increased approximately million to million compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was driven by higher expenses in the foodservice segment as a result of including the enodis es a expenses but was partially offset by lower crane segment and foodservice segment es a expenses due to lower employee related costs and other discretionary spending reductions and realization of synergies associated with the enodis integration 
the strength of the us dollar resulted in a decrease in es a expenses of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  
table of contents amortization expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for primarily as a result of the additional intangible assets acquired from enodis see further detail related to the intangible assets at note  acquisitions 
the company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets under the guidance of accounting standards codification asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
under asc topic  goodwill is no longer amortized  however  the company performs an annual impairment at june of every year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the company performs impairment reviews for its reporting units  which are cranes americas  cranes europe  middle east  and africa  cranes asia  crane care  foodservice americas  foodservice europe  middle east  and africa  and foodservice asia 
in january of  the foodservice retail reporting unit was merged into the foodservice americas reporting unit  which reflected operational and managerial changes 
in its impairment reviews  the company uses a fair value method based on the present value of future cash flows  which involves management s judgments and assumptions about the amounts of those cash flows and the discount rates used 
for goodwill  the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including recorded goodwill 
goodwill and other intangible assets are then subject to risk of write down to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value 
the analysis in the second quarter of did not indicate impairment of goodwill or other intangibles of any reporting unit 
during the first quarter of  the company s stock price continued to decline as global market conditions remained depressed  the credit markets did not improve and the performance of the company s crane and foodservice segments was below the company s expectations 
in connection with a reforecast of expected financial results completed in early april  the company determined the foregoing circumstances to be indicators of potential impairment under the guidance of asc topic therefore  the company performed the required initial impairment test for each of the company s reporting units as of march  the company re performed its established method of present valuing future cash flows  taking into account its updated projections  to determine the fair value of the reporting units 
the determination of fair value of the reporting units requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to  projections of revenue growth  operating earnings  discount rates  terminal growth rates  and required working capital for each reporting unit 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates  actual results could differ materially from the estimates 
the company evaluated the significant assumptions used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit  both individually and in the aggregate  and concluded they were reasonable 
the results of the analysis indicated that the fair values of three of the company s eight reporting units foodservice americas  foodservice europe  middle east  and africa  and foodservice retail were potentially impaired  and therefore  the company proceeded to measure the amount of the potential impairment with the assistance of a third party valuation firm 
upon completion of that assessment  the company recognized impairment charges as of march  of million related to goodwill 
the company also recognized impairment charges of million related to other indefinite lived intangible assets as of march  both charges were within the foodservice segment 
an additional million of impairment charges related to kysor warren and thus has been classified in discontinued operations 
these non cash impairment charges have no direct impact on the company s cash flows  liquidity  debt covenants  debt position or tangible asset values 
there is no tax benefit in relation to the goodwill impairment  however  the company did recognize a million benefit associated with the other indefinite lived intangible asset impairment 
in june  the company performed its annual impairment analysis relative to goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at june  and based on those results the company determined no additional impairment had occurred subsequent to the impairment charges recorded in the first quarter of the company continues to monitor market conditions and determine if any additional interim reviews of goodwill  other intangibles or long lived assets are warranted 
further deterioration in the market or actual results as compared with the company s projections may ultimately result in a future impairment 
in the event the company determines that assets are impaired in the future  the company would need to recognize a non cash impairment charge  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated balance sheet and results of operations 
the company is engaged in a number of integration activities associated with the enodis acquisition 
for the years ended december  and december  integration expenses were million and million  respectively 
integration expenses include only costs directly associated with the integration  such as costs related to outside vendors or services  costs of employees who have been assigned full time to integration activities  and travel related expenses 
during december  the company sold two product lines within its foodservice segment for aggregate net proceeds of approximately million and recognized an aggregate loss on the sale of million 
the two product lines that were divested were the company s lincoln smallwares products and most of its merco product category 
the smallwares products were sold to the vollrath company  llc and included products such as pots  pans  baking sheets and other cooking implements as well as manual food preparation equipment eg  slicers  peelers 
the merco product category was sold to hatco corporation and included food warming equipment  merchandisers  toasters  and racking dispensing systems 
the company recorded a loss of million for the sale of its smallwares products and a loss of million for the sale of its merco products 
restructuring expenses for the year ended december  totaled million which compares to million in as a result of the continued worldwide decline in crane segment sales in  the company recorded million in restructuring charges as it further reduced the crane segment cost structure in all regions 
in addition  the foodservice segment recorded restructuring expenses of million during the year ended december  in connection with closing of its harford duracool facility in aberdeen  maryland in the 
table of contents second quarter and its mccall facility in parsons  tennessee in the third quarter 
see further detail related to the restructuring expenses at note  restructuring 
interest expenses for the year ended december  totaled million versus million for the year ended december  the increase is the result of an additional interest expense related to the billion credit agreement which was entered into in order to fund the enodis acquisition and which was amended and restated as of august  to ultimately increase the size to billion new credit agreement and was drawn upon on november  see further detail on the new credit agreement at note  debt 
amortization expense for deferred financing fees was million for the year ended december  as compared to million in the higher expense in is related to the amortization of the fees associated with entering into the new credit agreement 
the loss on debt extinguishment of million for the year ended december  is a result of the accelerated paydown of term loan x of million by using the proceeds from the sale of the enodis ice businesses in the second quarter and the accelerated paydown of term loan b of million and term loan x of million using cash from operations in the fourth quarter 
for the year ended december   the company made a cash payment of million to partially pay down the balance of the term loan x from the proceeds of the marine divestiture and as a result of this payment  the company incurred a charge of million 
both charges were recorded in loss on debt extinguishment in the consolidated statements of operations 
during july  the company entered into various hedging transactions the hedges to comply with the terms of its new credit agreement see further detail related to the new credit agreement at note  debt issued to fund the purchase of enodis 
the hedges were required to limit the company s exposure to fluctuations in the underlying great british pound gbp purchase price of the enodis shares which could have ultimately required additional funding capacity under the new credit agreement 
subsequent to entering into the hedging transactions  the us dollar strengthened against the gbp which resulted in a significant change to the fair value of the underlying hedges 
under the guidance of asc topic  derivatives and hedging  hedges of a firm commitment to acquire a business do not qualify for hedge accounting or balance sheet treatment 
therefore  the periodic market value changes in these hedges were required to be recognized in the income statement 
for the year ended december   the loss on currency hedges related to the purchase of enodis was million 
other income  net for the year ended december  was million versus a loss of million for the prior year 
the income in was primarily the result of foreign currency gains related to transactions between our us and foreign crane facilities and is also partially due to higher interest income 
the loss in was the result of other foreign currency losses partially offset by interest income 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to negative for the year ended december  as the company posted a pre tax loss in  a positive effective tax rate represents a benefit to the consolidated statement of operations 
in the company posted pre tax income  for which a negative effective tax rate represents a benefit to the consolidated statement of operations 
the goodwill impairment of million in is not tax deductible and thus had an unfavorable impact to the effective tax rate 
the write down of the trademarks of million had an associated deferred tax liability of million which resulted in no impact to the effective tax rate for the income tax benefit for the year ended december  was favorably impacted by the reversal of various reserves for uncertain tax positions as discussed in note  income taxes 
during  the company determined that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would not be utilized in several jurisdictions including china  slovakia  spain  and the united kingdom 
therefore  the company recognized million of valuation allowances as income tax expense 
the company generated million of net operating loss carryforwards in france during  creating a deferred tax asset of million 
based upon the cyclicality of the company s crane business  management analyzes the ability to utilize these deferred tax assets on a seven year cycle  consistent with the crane business cycles  as this provides the best information to evaluate the future profitability of the business unit 
at december   the company concluded that a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset for the carryforward was not required to be recognized 
both the and effective tax rates were also favorably affected  as compared to the statutory rate  to varying degrees by certain global tax planning initiatives 
the effective tax rate in was favorably affected by the significant decrease in us pre tax income resulting from the loss on currency hedges related to the enodis acquisition  and certain global tax planning initiatives that are not impacted by pre tax income volatility 
the results from discontinued operations were a loss of million and a loss of million  net of income taxes  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the loss relates to the enodis ice businesses sold on may   the kysor warren business classified as held for sale at the end of and the final completion of closing and tax adjustments on the results of the discontinued operations associated with the disposition of the marine segment sold on december  the loss relates to the

our crane care business is not only a key differentiator for us  but it is also especially important to our customers as the market rebounds to ensure uptime availablity 
forecasting is extremely challenging due to mixed views from nearly every trade association and industry economist that we follow 
for example  the association of equipment manufacturers believes that the us construction machinery business will increase in however  the consensus construction forecast is estimating that the us construction industry for will only increase by 
from an international perspective  global insight  a provider of global economic and financial analysis  forecasting and market intelligence  believes the world s total construction will grow by in in light of these differing forecasts  we are maintaining as much operational flexibility as possible 
this includes tight controls on inventory  es a expenses and manufacturing costs  and a clear focus on earnings and cash 
we believe that we will continue to generate positive free cash flows
