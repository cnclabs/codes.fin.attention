we provide natural gas solutions for vehicle fleets primarily in the united states and canada 
our primary business activity is selling cng and lng vehicle fuel to our customers 
we also build  operate and maintain fueling stations  manufacture and service advanced natural gas fueling compressors  and related equipment  process and sell renewable biomethane and provide natural gas vehicle conversions 
our customers include fleet operators in a variety of markets  such as public transit  refuse hauling  airports  taxis and regional trucking 
in april  we opened our first cng station in lima  peru  through our joint venture  clean energy del peru 
in august  we acquired of the outstanding membership interests of dce 
dce owns a facility that collects  processes and sells renewable biomethane at the mccommas bluff landfill in dallas  texas 
on october   we acquired of baf technologies  inc baf  a company that provides natural gas conversions  alternative fuel systems  application engineering  service and warranty support and research and development for natural gas vehicles 
on september   we completed the purchase of imw  a company that manufactures and services advanced  non lubricated natural gas fueling compressor and related equipment 
on december   we acquired northstar  who provides design  engineering  construction and maintenance services for lng and lcng fueling stations 
overview this overview discusses matters on which our management primarily focuses in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance 
sources of revenue 
we generate the vast majority of our revenue from selling cng and lng and providing operations and maintenance services to our customers 
the balance of our revenue is provided by designing and constructing natural gas fueling stations  financing our customers natural gas vehicle purchases  sales of pipeline quality biomethane produced by our dce joint venture  sales of natural gas vehicles through our wholly owned subsidiary baf  and commencing on september   sales of advanced natural gas fueling compressors and related equipment and maintenance services through imw 
in addition  on december   we began generating revenue from lng and lcng fueling station design  engineering  construction and maintenance services through northstar 
key operating data 
in evaluating our operating performance  our management focuses primarily on the amount of cng and lng gasoline gallon equivalents delivered which we define as i the volume of gasoline gallon equivalents we sell to our customers  plus ii the volume of gasoline gallon equivalents dispensed to our customers at stations where we provide operating and maintenance o m services but do not directly sell the cng or lng  plus iii our proportionate share of the gasoline gallon equivalents sold as cng by our joint venture in peru  plus iv our proportionate share of the gasoline gallon equivalents of biomethane produced and sold as pipeline quality natural gas by dce  our gross margin which we define as revenue minus cost of sales  and net income loss 
the following table  which you should read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes contained elsewhere in this form k  presents our key operating data for the years ended december    and gasoline gallon equivalents delivered year ended december  in millions cng biomethane lng total operating data gross margin net loss key trends in  and according to the us energy information administration  demand for natural gas fuels in the united states increased by approximately during the period january  through december  we believe this growth in demand was attributable primarily to the rising prices of gasoline and diesel relative to cng and lng during these periods and increasingly stringent environmental regulations affecting vehicle fleets 
the number of fueling stations we served grew from at december  to at december  a increase 
included in this number are all of the cng and lng fueling stations we own  maintain or with which we have a fueling supply contract 
the amount of cng and lng gasoline gallon equivalents we delivered from to increased by 
the increase in gasoline gallon equivalents delivered was the primary contributor to increased revenues during these periods 
our cost of sales also increased during these periods  which was attributable primarily to increased costs related to delivering more cng and lng to our customers 
during the last half of and the twelve months of  we also experienced reduced margins in certain markets  particularly in the municipal transit and refuse sector 
the reduction in margins is primarily a result of increased competition and sales agreements with larger entities that have greater pricing leverage 
also  in many cases  our agreements with our customers  including governmental agencies  are subject to a competitive bidding process and we may be required to reduce our prices to maintain our contracts as they come up for bid 
we also have significant contracts with government entities that are experiencing large budget deficits and these customers have and may continue to demand price reductions for our services 
in addition  in may and june of  we acquired four compressed natural gas operations and maintenance services contracts with municipal transit agencies and in we won two contracts with a transit agency in california that have significant volume but smaller margins than we typically generate on our fuel sales 
as a result  the overall average margin on our fuel sales across our business decreased during these periods 
we believe that our margins on fuel sales will improve in the future to the extent we are successful in increasing our retail cng and lng fueling operations  which is where we earn our highest margin  relative to our lower margin operations  such as municipal transit 
if we are unsuccessful in growing our retail cng and lng fueling operations  we may experience reduced margins 
we may also lose contracts with governmental customers if we are unwilling or unable to reduce our prices or lose in the competitive bidding process  which would reduce our volumes 
for example  mts of san diego  which represented approximately million gasoline gallon equivalents of our cng volume in  conducted a competitive bidding procurement and awarded the contract to a competitor beginning july  the washington metropolitan area transit authority  which represented approximately million gallons of cng in  also conducted a competitive bidding procurement which resulted in the award of the contract to a competitor on december  we will need to increase our business with non government entities to replace volumes lost in competitive bid procurements when we are not successful in retaining the contracts 
during  prices for oil  gasoline  diesel fuel and natural gas generally increased 
oil increased from a low of per barrel on january  to a price of per barrel on december  in california  average retail prices for gasoline have increased from a low of per gallon in february to per gallon at december   and average retail prices for diesel fuel have increased from a low of per diesel gallon in february to per diesel gallon at december  higher gasoline and diesel prices improve our margins on fuel sales to the extent we price fuel at a discount to gasoline or diesel 
during this time period  the price for natural gas remained fairly consistent 
the nymex price for natural gas ranged from a low of per mmbtu in november to per mmbtu at december  the average retail sales price of our cng fuel sold in the los angeles metropolitan area ranged from for the month of january to for the month of december recent developments 
on september   the company  acting through certain of its subsidiaries  completed its purchase of imw 
imw manufactures and services advanced natural gas fueling compressors and related equipment for the global natural gas fueling market 
imw is headquartered near vancouver  british columbia  has a second manufacturing facility near shanghai  china and has sales and service offices in bangladesh  columbia and the united states 
we believe the acquisition of imw will enable us to participate in the growth of natural gas vehicle fueling overseas  as well as in north america  and enable us to offer our customers a wider variety of natural gas vehicle fueling solutions 
on december   we acquired northstar under a stock purchase agreement 
northstar is a leading provider of design  engineering  construction and maintenance services for lng and lcng fueling stations 
on february   we invested an additional million in the vehicle production group  llc 
at march   we have invested million in vpg 
on february  the closing date  we paid million for a interest in servotech engineering  inc servotech  a company who provides design and engineering services for natural gas fueling systems among other services 
we also have an option to purchase the remaining of servotech for million over the month period following the closing date 
anticipated future trends 
we anticipate that  over the long term  the prices for gasoline and diesel will continue to be higher than the price of natural gas as a vehicle fuel  and more stringent emissions requirements will continue to make natural gas vehicles an attractive alternative to traditional gasoline and diesel powered vehicles 
our belief that natural gas will continue  over the long term  to be a cheaper vehicle fuel than gasoline or diesel is based in part on the growth in us natural gas production 
a navigant consulting  inc study indicates that as a result of new unconventional gas shale discoveries from basins in the us  maximum estimates of total recoverable domestic reserves from producers have increased to equal years of us production at production levels 
the study indicated a mean level of reserves equal to years of supply at production levels 
according to the report  shale gas production growth from only the major six shale resources in the us  plus the marcellus shale  could become billion cubic feet per day and as high as billion cubic feet per day by navigant has also indicated that development of the shale resources base has resulted in a substantial surplus of natural gas compared to demand of as much as billion cubic feet per day 
these current surplus levels are of annual average historical us consumption levels of approximately tcf per year  providing sufficient gas supply to meet the requirements of all existing markets and to meet new market requirements 
based on analyst reports  we believe that there is a significant worldwide supply of natural gas relative to crude oil as well 
according to the bp statistical review of world energy  on a global basis  the ratio of proven natural gas reserves to natural gas production was greater than the ratio of proven crude oil reserves to crude oil production 
this analysis suggests significantly greater long term availability of natural gas than crude oil based on current consumption 
we believe there will be significant growth in the consumption of natural gas as a vehicle fuel among vehicle fleets  and our goal is to capitalize on this trend and enhance our leadership position as this market expands 
with our recent acquisitions of imw and northstar  we are now a fully integrated provider of advanced compression technology  station building and fueling 
we have built natural gas fueling stations  and plan to build additional natural gas fueling stations  that will provide lng to fleet vehicles at the ports of los angeles and long beach and for other regional corridors throughout the united states 
we also anticipate expanding our sales of cng and lng in the other markets in which we operate  including regional trucking  refuse hauling  airports and public transits 
consistent with the anticipated growth of our business  we also expect that our operating costs and capital expenditures will increase  primarily from the anticipated expansion of our station network or lng production capacity  as well as the logistics of delivering more cng and lng to our customers 
we also anticipate that we will continue to seek to acquire assets and or businesses that are in the natural gas fueling infrastructure or biomethane production business that may require us to raise additional capital 
additionally  we have and will continue to increase our sales and marketing team and other necessary personnel as we seek to expand our existing markets and enter new markets  which will also result in increased costs 
continuing high unemployment rates and reduced economic activity may reduce our opportunities to attract new fleet customers 
many governmental entities  which represented approximately of our revenues from through  are experiencing significant budget deficits as a result of the economic recession and have been  and may continue to be  unable to invest in new natural gas vehicles for their transit or refuse fleets or may be compelled to reduce public transportation and services  or the prices they pay for these services  which would negatively affect our business 
sources of liquidity and anticipated capital expenditures 
liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows  the sale or maturity of existing assets  or by the acquisition of additional funds through capital management 
historically  our principal sources of liquidity have consisted of cash provided by operations and financing activities 
our business plan calls for approximately million in capital expenditures in  primarily related to construction of new fueling stations 
we may also elect to invest additional amounts in expansion of our california lng plant  expansion of our dce landfill gas processing plant  or for other acquisitions or investments in companies or assets in the natural gas fueling infrastructure  services and production industries  including biomethane production 
we will need to raise additional capital as necessary to fund any expansion of our california lng plant or dce landfill gas plant  acquisitions or other capital expenditures or investments that we cannot fund through available cash  our line of credit from pcb  or cash generated by operations 
the timing and necessity of any future capital raise will depend on our rate of new station construction  which may be affected by any federal legislation that provides incentives for natural gas vehicle purchases and fuel use  any decision to expand our california lng plant or dce gas processing plant and potential merger or acquisition activity 
for more information  see liquidity and capital resources below 
we may not be able to raise capital on terms that are favorable to existing stockholders or at all 
any inability to raise capital may impair our ability to invest in new stations  expand our california lng plant or dce gas processing plant  develop natural gas fueling infrastructure and invest in strategic transactions or acquisitions and reduce our ability to grow our business and generate increased revenues 
business risks and uncertainties 
our business and prospects are exposed to numerous risks and uncertainties 
for more information  see risk factors in part i  item a 
operations we generate revenues principally by selling cng and lng and providing o m services to our vehicle fleet customers 
for the year ended december   cng and biomethane together represented and lng represented of our natural gas sales on a gasoline gallon equivalent basis 
to a lesser extent  we generate revenues by designing and constructing fueling stations and selling or leasing those stations to our customers 
we also generate material revenues through sales of biomethane produced by our joint venture subsidiary dce  sales of natural gas vehicles by our wholly owned subsidiary baf  sales of advanced natural gas fueling compressors and related equipment and maintenance services through imw since september   and commencing on december   sales of lng and lcng fueling station design  construction and o m services through northstar 
substantially all of our operating and maintenance revenues are generated from cng stations  as owners of lng stations tend to operate and maintain their own stations 
substantially all of our station sale and leasing revenues have been generated from cng stations 
cng sales we sell cng through fueling stations located on our customers properties and through our network of public access fueling stations 
at these cng fueling stations  we procure natural gas from local utilities or brokers under standard  floating rate arrangements and then compress and dispense it into our customers vehicles 
our cng sales are made primarily through contracts with our fleet customers 
under these contracts  pricing is determined primarily on an index plus basis  which is calculated by adding a margin to the local index or utility price for natural gas 
cng sales revenues based on an index plus methodology increase or decrease as a result of an increase or decrease in the price of natural gas 
we also sell a small amount of cng under fixed price contracts 
we will continue to offer fixed price contracts  as appropriate  and consistent with our natural gas hedging policy that was revised in may our fleet customers typically are billed monthly based on the volume of cng sold at a station 
the remainder of our cng sales are on a per fill up basis at prices we set at the pump based on prevailing market conditions 
these customers typically pay using a credit card at the station 
lng sales we sell substantially all of our lng to fleet customers  who typically own and operate their fueling stations 
we also sell lng to customers at our five public lng stations and for non vehicle use 
during  we procured of our lng from third party producers  and we produced the remainder of the lng at our liquefaction plants in texas and california 
for lng that we purchase from third parties  we may enter into take or pay contracts that require us to purchase minimum volumes of lng at index based rates 
we deliver lng via our fleet of tanker trailers to fueling stations  where it is stored and dispensed in liquid form into vehicles 
we sell lng principally through supply contracts that are priced on either a fixed price or index plus basis 
lng sales revenues based on an index plus methodology increase or decrease as a result of an increase or decrease in the price of natural gas 
we also provided price caps to certain customers on the index component of their index plus pricing arrangement for certain contracts we entered into on or prior to december  effective january   we ceased offering price cap contracts to our customers  but we will continue to perform our obligations under price cap contracts we entered into before january  we will continue to offer fixed price contracts as appropriate and consistent with our natural gas hedging policy adopted in may our lng contracts provide that we charge our customers periodically based on the volume of lng supplied 
government incentives from october  through december   we received a federal fuel tax credit vetc of per gasoline gallon equivalent of cng and per liquid gallon of lng that we sold as vehicle fuel 
based on the service relationship with our customers  either we or our customers were able to claim the credit 
we recorded these tax credits as revenues in our consolidated statements of operations as the credits are fully refundable and do not need to offset tax liabilities to be received 
as such  the credits are not deemed income tax credits under the accounting guidance applicable to income taxes 
in addition  we believe the credits are properly recorded as revenue because we often incorporate the tax credits into our pricing with our customers  thereby lowering the actual price per gallon we charge them 
the program providing for the vetc expires on december  operation and maintenance we generate a portion of our revenue from operation and maintenance agreements for cng fueling stations where we do not supply the fuel 
we refer to this portion of our business as o m 
at these fueling stations  the customer contracts directly with a local broker or utility to purchase natural gas 
for o m services  we do not sell the fuel itself  but generally charge a per gallon fee based on the volume of fuel dispensed at the station 
we include the volume of fuel dispensed at the stations at which we provide o m services in our calculation of aggregate gasoline gallon equivalents sold 
station construction we generate a small portion of our revenue from designing and constructing fueling stations and selling or leasing the stations to our customers 
for these projects  we act as general contractor or supervise qualified third party contractors 
we charge construction fees or lease rates based on the size and complexity of the project 
on december   we completed the purchase of northstar  an entity that provides design  engineering  construction and maintenance services for lng and lcng fueling stations 
since the december  acquisition date  northstar contributed approximately million to our revenue 
vehicle acquisition and finance in  we commenced offering vehicle finance services for some of our customers purchases of natural gas vehicles or the conversion of their existing gasoline or diesel powered vehicles to operate on natural gas 
we loan to certain qualifying customers a portion of  and on occasion up to  of the purchase price of their natural gas vehicles 
we may also lease vehicles in the future 
where appropriate  we apply for and receive state and federal incentives associated with natural gas vehicle purchases and pass these benefits through to our customers 
we may also secure vehicles to place with customers or pay deposits with respect to such vehicles prior to receiving a firm order from our customers  which we may be required to purchase if our customer fails to purchase the vehicle as anticipated 
through december   we have not generated significant revenue from vehicle finance activities 
landfill gas in august  we acquired of the outstanding membership interests of dce for a purchase price of million including transaction costs 
dce owns a facility that collects  processes and sells biomethane from the mccommas bluff landfill located in dallas  texas 
from the acquisition date through december   and for the years ended december  and  dce generated approximately million  million and million  respectively  in revenue from sales of biomethane  all of which is included in our consolidated statements of operations 
on april   dce entered into a fifteen year gas sale agreement with shell energy north america us  lp shell for the sale by dce to shell of biomethane produced by dce landfill gas processing facility 
dce retains the right to reserve from the gas sale agreement up to mmbtus per day of biomethane for sale as a vehicle fuel 
to the extent that dce produces volumes of biomethane in excess of the volumes sold under the agreement with shell  dce will either attempt to sell such volumes at then prevailing market prices or seek to enter into another gas sale agreement in the future 
there is no guarantee that dce will produce or be able to sell up to the maximum volumes called for under the agreement  and dce ability to produce such volumes of biomethane is dependent on a number of factors beyond dce control including  but not limited to  the availability and composition of the landfill gas that is collected  the impact on dce operations of the operation of the landfill by the city of dallas and the reliability of the processing plant critical equipment 
the processing equipment is currently being expanded and upgraded  which may result in significant down time to complete the work  which consequently may reduce dce sales of biomethane during the expansion and upgrade work 
the expansion and upgrade work is anticipated to continue into the first half of the sale price for the gas under the agreement with shell is fixed 
the sale price for the gas represents a substantial premium to the current prevailing prices for natural gas at march  the gas sale agreement is terminable by either party on thirty days written notice if the california energy commission makes a written determination or adopts a ruling or regulation after the date of the agreement that the biomethane sold under the agreement will  from the date of such ruling or regulation  no longer qualify as a california renewable portfolio standard eligible fuel 
in addition  shell has the right to terminate the agreement upon thirty days written notice if the volumes of biomethane produced and delivered  calculated monthly on a rolling two year average  are less than an annual average of  mmbtu per year or  mmbtu per day 
vehicle conversions on october   we purchased all of the outstanding shares of baf 
founded in  baf provides natural gas vehicle conversions  alternative fuel systems  application engineering  service and warranty support and research and development 
baf vehicle conversions include taxis  limousines  vans  pick up trucks and shuttle buses 
baf utilizes advanced natural gas system integration technology and has certified ngvs under both epa and carb standards achieving super ultra low emission vehicle emissions 
we generate revenues through the sale of natural gas vehicles that have been converted to run on natural gas by baf 
the majority of baf revenue during was derived from sales of converted natural gas service vans to at t and verizon 
during the fourth quarter of and for the year ended december   baf contributed approximately million and million  respectively  to our revenue 
natural gas fueling compressors on september   the company  acting through certain of its subsidiaries  completed its purchase of imw 
imw manufactures and services advanced  non lubricated natural gas fueling compressors and related equipment for the global natural gas fueling market 
imw is headquartered near vancouver  british columbia  has a second manufacturing facility near shanghai  china and has sales and service offices in bangladesh  columbia and the united states 
since the september  acquisition date  imw contributed approximately million to our revenue 
volatility of earnings and cash flows our earnings and cash flows historically have fluctuated significantly from period to period based on our futures activities  as all of our futures contracts entered into prior to june  have not qualified for hedge accounting under the relevant derivative accounting guidance 
we have therefore recorded any changes in the fair market value of these contracts that did not qualify for hedge accounting directly in our statements of operations in the line item derivative gains losses along with any realized gains or losses generated during the period 
for example  we experienced derivative loss of million in the year ended december  subsequent to june   our futures contracts did qualify for hedge accounting  so we had no derivative gains or losses in the years ended december  and related to our futures contracts 
in accordance with our natural gas hedging policy  we plan to structure all subsequent futures contracts as cash flow hedges under the applicable derivative accounting guidance  but we cannot be certain that they will qualify 
see risk management activities below 
if the futures contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting  we could incur significant increases or decreases in our earnings based on fluctuations in the market value of the contracts from period to period 
additionally  we are required to maintain a margin account to cover losses related to our natural gas futures contracts 
futures contracts are valued daily  and if our contracts are in loss positions at the end of a trading day  our broker will transfer the amount of the losses from our margin account to a clearinghouse 
if at any time the funds in our margin account drop below a specified maintenance level  our broker will issue a margin call that requires us to restore the balance 
consequently  these payments could significantly impact our cash balances 
at december   we had million on deposit in margin accounts  which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and notes receivable and other long term assets on the balance sheet 
the decrease in the value of our futures positions and any required margin deposits on our futures contracts that are in a loss position could significantly impact our financial condition in the future 
volatility of earnings related to series i warrants beginning january   under financial accounting standards board fasb authoritative guidance  we are required to record the change in the fair market value of our series i warrants in our consolidated financial statements 
we recognized a loss gain of million and million related to recording the fair market value changes of our series i warrants in the years ended december  and december   respectively 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein 
our earnings or loss per share may be materially impacted by future gains or losses we are required to take as a result of valuing our series i warrants 
on november    of the series i warrants were exercised and are no longer outstanding 
volatility of earnings related to contingent consideration under recent business combination accounting guidance  we are required to record the change in the value of the contingent consideration related to our acquisitions of both baf and imw in our financial statements through the contingency period  which expires december  for baf and march  for imw 
if the anticipated results of baf or imw increase or decrease during future periods  we may be required to recognize material losses or gains based on the valuation of the increased or decreased consideration due to the former baf and imw shareholders 
to record the change in value of the baf contingent consideration  we recognized losses of million and million during the quarters ended march  and june   respectively  and we recognized a gain of million during the quarter ended september  there was no change during the quarter ended december  subsequent to september   the closing date of the acquisition of imw  we determined that no adjustment was required to the value of the contingent consideration owed to the former imw shareholder during the quarter ended september   and we recognized a gain of million during the quarter ended december  related to this obligation 
our earnings or loss per share may be materially impacted by future gains or losses we are required to take as a result of changes in the contingent consideration amount 
debt compliance our credit agreement with pcb credit agreement requires us to comply with certain covenants 
we may not incur indebtedness or liens except as permitted by the credit agreement  or declare or pay dividends 
we must maintain  on a quarterly basis  minimum liquidity of not less than million  accounts receivable balances  as defined  of not less than million  consolidated net worth  as defined  of not less than million  and a debt to equity ratio  as defined  of not more than to beginning in the quarter ended june   we must also maintain a debt service ratio  as defined  of not less than to at each quarter end 
in computing these amounts  we exclude the financial results and amounts of imw 
effective in the fourth quarter of  we established a lock box arrangement with pcb subject to the credit agreement 
funds received from our customers are remitted to the lock box and then deposited to a pcb bank account 
the remitted funds are not used to pay down the balance of the credit agreement unless there is an event of default on the credit agreement 
one of the events of default is the occurrence of a material adverse change  which is a subjective acceleration clause 
based on the relevant accounting guidance  we have classified our debt pursuant to the credit agreement as short term or long term  as appropriate  and we believe the likelihood of an event of default is more than remote but not more likely than not 
if we default on the credit agreement  all of the obligations under the credit agreement will become immediately due and payable and all funds received in our lockbox held by pcb  plus million we have deposited with pcb in a payment reserve account  will be applied to the balance due on the credit agreement 
to the extent natural gas prices continue to fall  our volumes decline or our operating results do not materialize as planned  we could violate our covenants in the future 
in the event we violate our covenants  we would seek a waiver from the bank 
we were in compliance with all of our covenants at december  pursuant to the recent acquisition of imw  our credit agreement with hsbc also requires that imw complies with certain financial covenants as detailed in note of our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein 
among those financial covenants are that imw shall not permit its ratio of debt to tangible net worth to be greater than to until december  and greater than to on and after january   its tangible net worth to at anytime be below cad million and its ratio of current assets to current liabilities to be less than to until december  and less than to on and after january  should imw operating results not materialize as planned  we could violate these covenants 
if we were to violate a covenant  we would seek a waiver from the bank  which the bank is not obligated to grant 
if the bank does not grant a waiver  all of the obligations under the credit agreement would be due and payable 
imw was in compliance with these covenants as of december  risk management activities historically  a significant portion of our natural gas fuel sales have been covered by contracts to sell lng or cng to our customers at a fixed price or a variable index based price subject to a cap 
these contracts expose us to the risk that the price of natural gas may increase above the natural gas cost component included in the price at which we are committed to sell gas to our customers 
we account for sales of natural gas under these contracts as described below in critical accounting policies fixed price and price cap sales contracts 
in an effort to mitigate the volatility of our earnings related to our futures contracts and to reduce our risk related to fixed price sales contracts  our board of directors revisited our risk management policies and procedures and adopted a revised natural gas hedging policy in february  which was amended effective may   and restricts our ability to purchase natural gas futures contracts and offer fixed price sales contracts to our customers 
unless otherwise agreed in advance by the board of directors and the derivative committee  we will conduct our futures activities and enter into fixed price sales contracts only in accordance with the natural gas hedging policy  a complete copy of which was filed as exhibit to our form k filed with the sec on june  pursuant to the policy  we only purchase futures contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in expected future cash flows related to a particular fixed price contract or bid 
subject to the conditions set forth in the policy  we purchase futures contracts in quantities reasonably expected to hedge effectively our exposure to cash flow variability related to such fixed price sales contracts entered into after the date of the policy 
the summary of the policy described above does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the copy of the policy previously filed 
due to the restrictions of our revised hedging policy  we expect to offer fewer fixed price sales contracts to our customers 
if we do offer a fixed price sales contract  we anticipate including a price component that would cover our increased costs as well as a return on our estimated cash requirements over the duration of the underlying futures contracts 
the amount of this price component will vary based on the anticipated volume and the natural gas price component to be covered under the fixed price sales contracts 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses  and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  asset realization  accounts receivable reserves  notes receivable reserves  warranty reserves  derivative values  income taxes  and the fair value of equity instruments granted as stock based compensation 
we use historical experience  market quotes  and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the goodwill below its carrying amount 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to i a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  ii unanticipated competition  or iii an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
in performing the impairment review  we determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill  to those reporting units 
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
a component of an operating segment is deemed a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
more than one component can be combined in to one reporting unit assuming certain aggregation criteria are met 
to evaluate whether goodwill is impaired  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit carrying amount  including goodwill 
we determine the fair value of each reporting unit using the present value of expected future cash flows for that reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
to date  we have had no impairments of goodwill 
we test tangible and intangible long lived assets with definite useful lives for impairment whenever circumstances or events may affect the recoverability of the long lived assets 
the evaluation is primarily dependent on the estimated future cash flows of the assets and the fair value of these items  as determined by management based on a number of estimates  including future cash flow projections  discount rates and terminal values 
in determining these estimates  management considered internally generated information and information obtained from discussions with market participants 
the determination of fair value requires significant judgment both by management and outside experts engaged to assist in this process 
the impairment test for long lived assets is a two step process 
the first step is to assess if events or changes in circumstances have affected the recoverability of long lived assets 
if management believes that recoverability has been affected  then step two requires management to calculate the undiscounted future cash flow related to the asset or asset group and to compare the cash flow to the carrying value of the asset or asset group 
if the undiscounted future cash flows exceed the carrying value  then there is no impairment 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to an operating and maintenance contract we lost in a competitive bid to a competitor 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  our subsidiary  dce  expensed approximately million of costs related to equipment that was replaced as part of its expansion of the mccommas bluff landfill in dallas  texas 
warranty reserves our warranty periods range up to thirty six months  depending on the product or service 
we provide a warranty reserve for estimated product warranty costs at the time the net sales are recognized 
although we engage in quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and the cost of the failed product 
we continuously monitor and analyze warranty claims and maintain a reserve for the related warranty costs based on historical experience and assumptions 
if actual failure rates and the resulting cost of repair vary from our historically based estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty reserve would be required 
natural gas derivative activities fasb authoritative guidance for our derivative instruments  specifically our natural gas futures contracts  requires the recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and the measurement of those instruments at fair value to the extent they qualify for hedge accounting 
for those contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting  we record the changes in the fair value of the derivatives directly to our consolidated statements of operations 
for those contracts that do qualify for hedge accounting  we record the changes in the fair value in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of stockholders equity 
we determine the fair value of our derivatives at the end of each reporting period based on quoted market prices from the nymex discounted to reflect the time value of money for contracts related to future periods 
the counter party to our derivative transactions is a high credit quality counterparty  however  we are subject to counterparty credit risk to the extent the counterparty to the derivatives is unable to meet its settlement commitments 
we manage this credit risk by minimizing the number and size of its derivative contracts and by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of our counterparties 
we record valuation adjustments against the derivative assets to reflect counterparty risk  if necessary 
the counterparty is also exposed to credit risk by us  which requires us to provide cash deposits as collateral when our contracts are in a liability position in the aggregate 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on our gas sales and for our o m services in accordance with us gaap  which requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and title and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
applying these factors  we typically recognize revenue from the sale of natural gas at the time fuel is dispensed or  in the case of lng sales agreements  delivered to our customers storage facilities 
we recognize revenue from o m agreements as we provide the related services 
in certain transactions with our customers  we agree to provide multiple products or services  including construction of and either leasing or sale of a station  providing o m to the station  and sale of fuel to the customer 
we evaluate the separability of revenues based on current fasb authoritative guidance  which provides a framework for establishing whether or not a particular arrangement with a customer has one or more revenue elements 
prior to  to the extent we had adequate objective evidence of the values of the separate elements indentified as part of a contract  we allocated the revenue from the contract on a relative fair value basis at the inception of the arrangement 
during and  we did not have objective evidence for our multi element arrangements  which generally resulted in the deferral of revenue until the future services are performed 
however  in  we elected to apply newly issued fasb authoritative guidance that allows us to use a combination of objective and reliable evidence to develop management best estimate of the fair value of the undelivered element 
if the arrangement contains a lease  we use the existing evidence of fair value to separate the lease from the other elements in the arrangement 
we recognize revenue related to our leasing activities in accordance with current fasb authoritative guidance 
our existing station leases are sales type leases  giving rise to profit at the delivery of the leased station 
unearned revenue is amortized into income over the life of the lease using the effective interest method 
for those arrangements  we recognize gas sales and o m service revenues as earned from the customer on a volume delivered basis 
we typically recognize revenue on long term fueling station construction projects where we sell the station to the customer using the completed contract method 
however  for imw and northstar  we use the percentage of completion method of accounting 
in those circumstances  revenue is recognized as work on a contract progresses  based on cost incurred in relation to total estimated costs to be incurred for that project 
we recognize revenue on biomethane sales and vehicle sales when we transfer title of the gas or vehicle to our customer 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense related to stock options granted to employees based on the grant date fair value 
our assessment of the estimated fair value of the stock options granted is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact 
we utilize the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
this model also requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected volatility of our common stock price  expected dividends  if any  expected life of the stock option  and the risk free interest rate appropriate for the expected holding period 
income taxes we compute income taxes under the asset and liability method 
this method requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
the impact on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates and laws  if any  are applied to the years during which temporary differences are expected to be settled and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period of enactment 
we record a valuation allowance against any deferred tax assets when management determines it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized 
when evaluating the need for a valuation analysis  we use estimates involving a high degree of judgment including projected future income and the amounts and estimated timing of the reversal of any deferred tax liabilities 
we operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time for resolution 
although we believe that adequate consideration has been given to such issues  it is possible that the ultimate resolution of such issues could be significantly different than originally estimated 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein 
results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  revenue 
revenue increased by million to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  a portion of this increase was the result of an increase in the number of gallons delivered between periods from million gasoline gallon equivalents to million gasoline gallon equivalents 
the increase in volume was primarily from an increase in cng sales of million gallons 
the acquisition of four compressed natural gas operations and maintenance services contracts in may and june of  four new refuse customers  two new transit customers  and one regional trucking customer together accounted for million gallons of the cng volume increase 
the volume growth from our existing public  refuse and transit customers  combined with the volume growth from our share of our joint venture in peru  contributed to the remaining cng volume increase 
we also experienced an increase of million gallons in lng volume between periods  which was primarily due to the volume growth of million gallons from our existing transit and refuse customers  combined with a million gallon increase from our port trucking customers 
we also had a lng volume increase of million gallons from two new refuse customers 
we had an increase in biomethane sales our share of the biomethane sales at dce of million gallons 
revenue also increased between periods by million from sales of natural gas conversion equipment and vehicles by baf  which we acquired on october  our acquisitions of imw on september  and northstar on december  contributed million and million  respectively  to our increased revenue between periods 
we also experienced a million increase  excluding northstar  in station construction revenues between periods 
revenue attributable to vetc also increased between periods as we recorded million of revenue related to fuel tax credits in  compared to million in these increases were offset by the decrease in our effective price per gallon charged between periods 
our effective price per gallon was for the year ended december   which represents a per gallon decrease from in the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to the acquisition of certain o m agreements in and that generate less revenue per gallon than contracts where we supply the natural gas commodity 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased by million to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  our cost of sales primarily increased between periods as a result of delivering more volume to our customers together with million of increased costs related to baf vehicle equipment sales  which we began to recognize on october  when we acquired the company 
our acquisition of imw on september  and northstar on december  contributed million and million  respectively  to our increased cost of sales between periods 
we also experienced a million increase in station construction costs between periods 
these increases were offset by the decrease in our effective cost per gallon of per gallon  to per gallon during this decrease was primarily the result of certain o m contracts that we acquired in and that are included in our volume totals but do not increase our cost of sales amount significantly as we do not pay for the natural gas consumed at the properties 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  a significant portion of this increase was the result of our salaries and benefits amount increasing by million between periods as we increased our employee headcount from at december  to including the addition of  and imw  baf and northstar employees  respectively at december  we also experienced a million increase in business insurance  contract labor  software hardware maintenance  training seminars and office supplies related to our continued business growth and our acquisitions of imw and northstar in our travel and entertainment expenses increased million between periods  primarily due to the increased travel of our sales team 
in addition  our professional fees increased million between periods  primarily for legal  audit and consulting services related to the acquisitions of imw and northstar 
includes a reversal of a bad debt for million that did not recur in our marketing expenses increased million between periods primarily due to certain advertising we conducted related to the ports of los angeles and long beach and the refuse sector 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to an intangible asset as one of the contracts we acquired in was lost through a competitive bidding process  and million at our dce subsidiary related to equipment that was replaced as part of their expansion of the mccommas bluff landfill in dallas  texas 
offsetting these increases was a decrease of million between periods related to our stock based compensation expense and a decrease of million during the fourth quarter of related to a decrease in the imw contingent consideration liability 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to additional depreciation expense in the year ended december  related to increased property and equipment balances between periods  primarily related to our expanded station network 
our amortization expense includes increased amortization of the intangible assets we obtained in connection with our acquisition of the operation and maintenance contracts we acquired during the second quarter of  baf in the fourth quarter of  imw in the third quarter of  and northstar in the fourth quarter of derivative gain loss on series i warrant valuation 
derivative gain loss decreased by million to a gain of million in the year ended december   from a loss of million in the year ended december  the amounts represent the non cash impact with respect to valuing our outstanding series i warrants based on our mark to market accounting for the warrants see note to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein during the periods 
interest income expense  net 
interest income expense  net  increased by million from to million of expense for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of an increase in interest expense in the year ended december  related to debt we incurred related to the acquisition of imw 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  increased by million to million of income for the year ended december   from a loss of million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the impact of foreign currency exchange gains at imw 
income loss from equity method investment 
during  we recorded equity income of million related to our interest in our peruvian joint venture  and in  we recorded a gain of million related to our interest 
loss income of noncontrolling interest 
during the year ended december   we recorded million for the noncontrolling interest in the net loss of dce  compared to million for the noncontrolling interest in the net loss of dce in the year ended december  the noncontrolling interest represents the interest of our joint venture partner 
fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  revenue 
revenue increased by million to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  a portion of this increase was the result of an increase in the number of gallons delivered from million gasoline gallon equivalents to million gasoline gallon equivalents 
revenue also increased by million from sales of natural gas conversion equipment and vehicles by baf  which we acquired on october   and million in increased station construction revenue between periods 
the increase in volume was primarily from an increase in cng sales of million gallons and an increase in biomethane sales our share of the biomethane sales of dce of million gallons 
the acquisition of four compressed natural gas operations and maintenance services contracts in may and june  eight new refuse customers  and one new transit customer together accounted for million gallons of the cng volume increase 
the volume growth from our joint venture in peru and from existing refuse and transit customers contributed to the remaining cng volume increase 
we believe that the biomethane sales increase was primarily attributable to our investment in new wells and the capital upgrades to the processing plant that we completed in the first quarter of we also experienced an increase of million gallons in lng volume between periods  which was primarily due to the volume growth from our port trucking customers 
these increases were offset by the decrease in our effective price per gallon charged between periods 
our effective price per gallon was in the year ended december   which represents a per gallon decrease from in the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to the decreased price of natural gas in  upon which a significant portion of our revenues are based 
in the majority of our contracts  natural gas commodity prices are a direct pass through to our customer or the customer pays for the natural gas commodity themselves 
revenue attributable to vetc also decreased between periods as we recorded million of revenue related to fuel tax credits in  compared to million in due to the fact that a few of our customers began collecting the credit that we had previously collected 
cost of sales 
cost of sales decreased by million to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  our cost of sales primarily decreased between periods as a result of our effective cost per gallon declining by per gallon to in  primarily due to the decreased price of natural gas in offsetting this decrease was a million increase in costs related to delivering more volume between periods together with million of costs related to baf vehicle sales  which we began to recognize on october  when we acquired the company 
we also experienced a million increase in station construction costs between periods 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  our marketing expenses decreased million between periods primarily because we did not incur certain advertising costs related to the ports of los angeles and long beach and to support the clean alternative fuels act in california in as we did in our bad debt expense decreased million between periods due to a reversal of our baf loan loss provision in the third quarter of our professional service fees decreased million between periods primarily due to reduced legal  audit and consulting services 
these decreases were offset by million increase in stock option expense between periods  primarily due to the expensing of options granted to our employees in december and january  and an increase of million in bonus expense between periods due to higher anticipated payouts in there was also an increase of million in salaries and benefits between periods primarily related to the hiring of additional employees 
our employee headcount increased from at december  to at december  depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to additional depreciation expense in the year ended december  related to increased property and equipment balances between periods  including our expanded station network and our california lng plant 
our december  amortization amount also includes amortization of the city of dallas landfill gas lease that we acquired in connection with our acquisition of dce on august  and amortization of the intangible assets we obtained in connection with our acquisition of the operation and maintenance contracts we acquired during the second quarter of and baf in the fourth quarter of derivative losses 
derivative losses increased by million to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  the amount represents the impact of our mark to market accounting for our series i warrants see note to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein 
the amount represents a loss we recognized in the year ended december  with respect to the sale of certain futures contracts we purchased in conjunction with the portion of a fixed priced bid on an lng supply contract 
interest income expense  net 
interest income expense  net  decreased by million to  of expense for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of an increase in interest expense in the year ended december  related to debt we incurred with pcb to acquire our interest in dce on august  other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  increased by  to  of expense for the year ended december  this increase was primarily related to the write off of certain non recoverable station costs in the year ended december  that did not occur in the year ended december  income loss from equity method investment

loss income of noncontrolling interest 
during the year ended december   we recorded  for the noncontrolling interest in the net loss of dce 
the noncontrolling interest represents the interest of our joint venture partner 
in  we recorded  for the non controlling interest in the net loss of dce 
seasonality and inflation to some extent  we experience seasonality in our results of operations 
natural gas vehicle fuel amounts consumed by some of our customers tends to be higher in summer months when buses and other fleet vehicles use more fuel to power their air conditioning systems 
natural gas commodity prices tend to be higher in the fall and winter months due to increased overall demand for natural gas for heating during these periods 
since our inception  inflation has not significantly affected our operating results 
however  costs for construction  repairs  maintenance  electricity and insurance are all subject to inflationary pressures and could affect our ability to maintain our stations adequately  build new stations  build new lng plants and expand our existing facilities or materially increase our operating costs 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our principal sources of liquidity have consisted of cash provided by operations and financing activities 
in may  we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share 
net cash proceeds from the initial public offering were approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses 
on august   in connection with our acquisition of of the membership interests of dce  we entered into a credit agreement with pcb pursuant to which we borrowed million under a term loan and an additional million under a line of credit see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
on september   we sold  shares of our common stock at a price of per share to boone pickens interests  ltd 
for proceeds of approximately million 
on november   we sold  units of common stock and warrants for per unit and we raised net proceeds of approximately million after deducting offering costs 
on july   we sold  shares of our common stock to third party investors and received net proceeds of million 
on november   we sold  shares of our common stock  primarily to third party investors  and received net proceeds of million 
additionally  on november   we entered into an amendment with one of the holders of the series i warrants pursuant to which the expiration date of such warrant for the purchase of  shares of common stock was changed to november  and the warrants were exercised on this date 
proceeds  net of offering costs from the exercise of the series i warrants  totaled million 
on october   we repaid the million term loan with pcb and simultaneously amended the credit agreement to obtain a million line of credit loc from pcb 
the million loc expires august   but we have a one year renewal option we can exercise as long as we are not in default on the pcb debt facilities 
as of december   we have not drawn any loan amounts under the loc and we had an outstanding balance of million on our facility b loan 
as of december   imw had an outstanding balance of million under the imw lines of credit and a balance of million under the imw notes 
in addition to funding operations  our principal uses of cash have been  and are expected to be  the construction of new fueling stations  construction of lng production facilities  the purchase of new lng tanker trailers  investment in biomethane production  mergers and acquisitions  the financing of natural gas vehicles for our customers and general corporate purposes  including making deposits to support our derivative activities  geographic expansion domestically and internationally  expanding our sales and marketing activities  support of legislative initiatives and for working capital for our expansion 
we have also acquired and may continue to seek to acquire and invest in companies or assets in the natural gas and biomethane fueling infrastructure  services and production industries 
on december   the company acquired of the equity interests of northstar 
the purchase price primarily consisted of a closing cash payment in the amount of million 
the remaining consideration consisted of annual future payments in the amount of million  commencing on the first anniversary of the closing date and ending on the fifth anniversary of the closing date 
the company has also committed to pay up to million in retention bonuses to certain key employees commencing on the first anniversary of the closing and ending on the fourth anniversary of the closing date 
we financed our operations in primarily through cash on hand and cash provided by financing activities 
at december   we had total cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to million at december  cash used in operating activities was million for  compared to million of cash provided by operating activities in our operating cash flow  before working capital changes  increased between periods  mostly due to the improved operating results at baf in offsetting this increase was a decrease in our working capital amounts between periods  primarily caused by an increase in receivable balances between periods 
the biggest increase between periods related to our fuel tax credit receivable  which increased million from to we anticipate receiving approximately million of our tax credit receivables in the second quarter of cash used in investing activities was million for  compared to million for our purchases of property and equipment were million during  compared to million in in  we acquired four compressed natural gas operations and maintenance service contracts and baf for million 
in  we paid million related to our acquisitions of imw and northstar 
we made an additional investment in the vehicle production group  llc vpg  a company developing a cng taxi and a paratransit vehicle  during of million  compared to million for the same period in cash provided by financing activities for was million  compared to million for in  we received net proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock and the exercise of stock options 
in  we received net proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock and the exercise of stock options 
also in  we received net proceeds of million related to the exercise of  series i warrants 
in  we drew million from pcb to fund capital expenditures related to dce landfill plant upgrade and paid back million of capital lease obligations and debt instruments during the year 
in  we drew million and paid million under imw revolving line of credit 
we also made payments of million on our capital lease obligations and debt instruments during the year 
our financial position and liquidity are  and will be  influenced by a variety of factors  including our ability to generate cash flows from operations  deposits and margin calls on our futures positions  the level of any outstanding indebtedness and the interest we are obligated to pay on this indebtedness  our capital expenditure requirements which consist primarily of station construction  lng plant construction costs  dce plant construction costs and the purchase of lng tanker trailers and equipment and any merger or acquisition activity 
capital expenditures our business plan calls for approximately million in capital expenditures in  primarily related to construction of new fueling stations 
we may also elect to invest additional amounts in expansion of our california lng plant  expansion of our dce landfill gas processing plant  construction of a michigan landfill gas processing plant  or for other acquisitions or investments in companies or assets in the natural gas fueling infrastructure  services and production industries  including biomethane production 
we will need to raise additional capital as necessary to fund any expansion of our california lng plant or dce landfill gas plant  acquisitions or other capital expenditures or investments that we cannot fund through available cash  our line of credit from pcb  the potential exercise of a warrant for  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share held by boone pickens that expires in december  or cash generated by operations 
the timing and necessity of any future capital raise will depend on our rate of new station construction  which may be affected by any federal legislation that provides incentives for natural gas vehicle purchases and fuel use  any decision to expand our california lng plant or dce gas processing plant and potential merger or acquisition activity 
for more information  see liquidity and capital resources below 
we may not be able to raise capital on terms that are favorable to existing stockholders or at all 
any inability to raise capital may impair our ability to invest in new stations  expand our california lng plant or dce gas processing plant  develop natural gas fueling infrastructure and invest in strategic transactions or acquisitions and reduce the ability of our business to grow and generate increased revenues 
our credit agreement with pcb requires that we comply with certain covenants  as detailed in footnote of our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein 
one of the covenants requires that we maintain accounts receivable balances from certain subsidiaries above million at each quarter end during the term 
to the extent natural gas prices fall  which would result in decreased revenues  or our volumes sold decline  we could violate this covenant 
also  beginning with the quarter ending june   we are required to maintain a debt service ratio  as defined  of to should our operating results not materialize as planned  we could violate this covenant 
if we were to violate a covenant  we would seek a waiver from the bank  which the bank is not obligated to grant 
if the bank does not grant a waiver  all of the obligations under the credit agreement will become immediately due and payable and million of our funds held by pcb would be applied to the balance due on the pcb loans 
we also would be unable to use the million pcb line of credit if this were to occur 
we were in compliance with all of the covenants as of december  contractual obligations the following represents the scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt and capital lease obligations a operating lease commitments b take or pay lng purchase contracts c construction contracts d total a consists of long term debt and capital lease obligations to finance acquisitions and equipment purchases  including interest 
b consists of various space and ground leases for our california lng plant  offices and fueling stations as well as leases for equipment 
c the amounts in the table represent our estimates for our fixed lng purchase commitments under two take or pay contracts 
d consists of our obligations to fund various fueling station construction projects  net of amounts funded through december   and excluding contractual commitments related to station sales contracts 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had the following off balance sheet arrangements that had  or are reasonably likely to have  a material effect on our financial condition 
outstanding surety bonds for construction contracts and general corporate purposes totaling million  two take or pay contracts for the purchase of lng  operating leases where we are the lessee  operating leases where we are the lessor and owner of the equipment  and firm commitments to sell cng and lng at fixed prices 
we provide surety bonds primarily for construction contracts in the ordinary course of business  as a form of guarantee 
no liability has been recorded in connection with our surety bonds as we do not believe  based on historical experience and information currently available  that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these arrangements for which we will not be reimbursed 
we have entered into two contracts that require us to purchase minimum volumes of lng 
one contract expires in june and the other contract expires in october we have entered into operating lease arrangements for certain equipment and for our office and field operating locations in the ordinary course of business 
the terms of our leases expire at various dates through additionally  in november  we entered into a ground lease for acres in california on which we built our california lng liquefaction plant 
the lease is for an initial term of thirty years and requires payments of  per year  plus up to  per year for each million gallons of production capacity utilized  subject to future adjustment based on consumer price index changes 
we must also pay a royalty to the landlord for each gallon of lng produced at the facility  as well as a fee for certain other services that the landlord will provide 
commercial operations began december   and the fixed payments for this lease are included in operating lease commitments in the contractual obligations table set forth above 
we are also the lessor in various leases with our customers  whereby our customers lease certain stations and equipment that we own 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to various market risk factors  including changes in general economic conditions  domestic and foreign competition  commodity price risk and foreign currency exchange rates 
commodity risk 
we are subject to market risk with respect to our sales of natural gas  which has historically been subject to volatile market conditions 
our exposure to market risk is heightened when we have a fixed price or price cap sales contract with a customer that is not covered by a futures contract  or when we are otherwise unable to pass through natural gas price increases to customers 
natural gas prices and availability are affected by many factors  including weather conditions  overall economic conditions and foreign and domestic governmental regulation and relations 
natural gas costs represented or excluding baf of our cost of sales for and or excluding baf  imw and northstar of our cost of sales for prices for natural gas over the eleven year period from december  through december   based on the nymex daily futures data  have ranged from a low of per mcf to a high of per mcf 
at december   the nymex index price of natural gas was per mcf 
to reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations in natural gas  we may enter into exchange traded natural gas futures contracts 
these arrangements also expose us to the risk of financial loss in situations where the other party to the contract defaults on its contract or there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the contract and the actual price of natural gas we pay at the delivery point 
we account for these futures contracts in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance on derivatives 
the accounting under this guidance for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends upon whether it has been specified in a hedging relationship and  further  on the type of hedging relationship 
to qualify for designation in a hedging relationship  specific criteria must be met and appropriate documentation maintained 
the fair value of the futures contracts we use is based on quoted prices in active exchange traded or over the counter markets which are then discounted to reflect the time value of money for contracts applicable to future periods 
the fair value of these futures contracts is continually subject to change due to market conditions 
in an effort to mitigate the volatility in our earnings related to futures activities our board of directors adopted a revised natural gas hedging policy which restricts our ability to purchase natural gas futures contracts and offer fixed price sales contracts to our customers 
we plan to structure prospective futures contracts so that they will be accounted for as cash flow hedges under this guidance  but we cannot be certain they will qualify 
for more information  please read risk management activities above 
we have prepared a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk with respect to the futures contracts we hold as of december  to hedge the fixed price component of certain supply contracts 
if the price of natural gas were to fluctuate increase or decrease by from the price quoted on nymex on december  per mcf  we could expect a corresponding fluctuation in the value of the contracts of approximately million 
foreign exchange rate risk 
because we have foreign operations  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
since the functional currency of our foreign operations is in their local currency  the currency effects of translating the financial statements of those foreign subsidiaries  which operate in local currency environments  are included in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of consolidated equity and do not impact earnings 
however  foreign currency transaction gains and losses not in our subsidiaries functional currency do impact earnings and resulted in approximately million of gains in during our primary exposure to foreign currency rates related to our canadian operations that had certain outstanding notes payable denominated in the us dollar that were not hedged 
we have prepared a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk with respect to our monetary transactions denominated in a foreign currency 
if the exchange rate on these assets and liabilities were to fluctuate by from the rate as of december   we would expect a corresponding fluctuation in the value of the assets and liabilities of approximately million
