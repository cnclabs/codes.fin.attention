risk factors 
you should carefully consider the following risks together with all of the other information contained in this report in evaluating our company 
if any of these risks develop into actual events  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
risks related to our business generally our business depends upon our ability to sponsor  and raise debt and equity capital for  our investment funds 
our business as a specialized asset manager depends upon our ability to sponsor investment funds  raise sufficient equity capital and debt financing for these funds and to generate management fees by managing these funds and the assets they hold 
if we are unable to raise capital or obtain financing through these funds  we will not be able to increase our assets under management and  accordingly  increase our revenues from management fees 
moreover  because many of our investment funds have limited terms  an inability to sponsor new investment funds could result in reduced assets under management and  accordingly  reduce our management fee revenues over time 
our ability to raise capital and obtain financing through these funds depends upon numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control  including existing capital markets conditions which may affect interest rates  asset valuation and pricing  our ability to exit and realize value from investments and returns on assets  market acceptance of the types of funds we sponsor and market perceptions about the types of assets which we seek to acquire for our funds  the willingness or ability of investors to invest in long term  relatively illiquid investments of the type we sponsor  the performance of our existing funds relative to market performance generally and to the performance of similar types of funds  the availability of qualified personnel to manage our funds  the availability of suitable investments on acceptable terms in the types of assets and other assets that we seek to acquire for our funds  and interest rate changes and their effect on both the assets we seek to acquire for our funds  and the amount  cost and availability of acquisition financing 
under current market conditions  our ability to raise equity capital from both retail and institutional investors may not be at the same levels that we have achieved historically 
while we have sought to counteract this decline by sponsorship of rre opportunity reit  we cannot assure you that it will succeed in doing so 
declines in the market values of our investments may reduce our earnings and the availability of credit 
we classify a material portion of our assets for accounting purposes as available for sale 
as a result  changes in the market values of those assets are directly charged or credited to stockholders equity 
a decline in these values will reduce the book value of our assets 
moreover  if the decline in value of an available for sale asset is other than temporary  such decline will reduce earnings 
as a result of market conditions  the market value of many of our assets has declined 
we cannot assure you that there will not be further declines in the value of our assets  or that the declines will not be material 
a decline in the market value of our assets may also adversely affect us in instances where we have borrowed money based on the market value of those assets or seek new borrowings 
if the market value of assets securing an existing loan declines  the lender may reduce availability if the loan is a line of credit  require us to post additional collateral or require us to paydown the loan so that it meets specified loan to collateral value ratios 
if we were unable to post the additional collateral  we could have to sell the assets under adverse market conditions which could result in losses and which could result in us failing our debt covenants 
moreover  a decline in asset values could limit our ability to obtain financing in the amounts we seek or require us to provide more collateral to secure proposed financing 
market changes  including changes in interest rates  may reduce the value of our assets  our returns on these assets and our ability to generate and increase our management fee revenues 
market changes  including changes in interest rates  will affect the market value of assets we hold for our own account and our returns from such assets 
in general  as interest rates rise  the value of fixed rate investments will decrease  while as interest rates fall  the return on variable rate assets will fall 
in addition  changes in interest rates may affect the value and return on assets we manage for our investment funds  thereby affecting both our management fees from those funds and  in particular  any performance based or incentive fees as well as our ability to sponsor additional investment funds  which  in turn  may affect our ability to generate and increase our management fee revenues 

back to index 
back to index increases in interest rates will increase our operating costs 
as of september   excluding credit facilities related to our commercial finance operations  we had two corporate credit facilities that were subject to variable interest rates 
we may seek to obtain other credit facilities depending upon capital markets conditions 
any facilities that we may be able to obtain may also be at variable rates 
as a result  increases in interest rates on such credit facilities  to the extent they are with recourse to us and are not matched by increased interest rates or other income from the assets whose acquisition was financed by these facilities  or are not subject to effective hedging arrangements  will increase our interest costs  which would reduce our net income or cause us to sustain losses 
changes in interest rates may impair the operating results of our investment funds and thereby impair our operating results 
the investments made by many of our funds are interest rate sensitive 
as a result  changes in interest rates could reduce the value of the assets held by those funds and the returns to investors  thereby impairing our ability to raise capital see our business depends upon our ability to sponsor  and raise debt and equity capital for  our investment funds  above  reducing the management and other fees from those funds and reducing our returns on  and the value of  amounts we have invested in those funds 
if we cannot generate sufficient cash to fund our participations in our investment funds  our ability to maintain and increase our revenues may be impaired 
we typically participate in our investment funds along with our investors  and believe that our participation enhances our ability to raise capital from investors 
we typically fund our participations through cash derived from operations or from financing 
if our cash from operations is insufficient to fund our participation in future investment funds we sponsor  and we cannot arrange for financing  our continuing ability to raise funds from investors and  thus  our ability to maintain and increase the revenues we receive from fund management  will be impaired 
termination of management arrangements with one or more of our investment funds could harm our business 
we provide management services to our investment funds through management agreements  through our position as the sole or managing general partner of partnership funds  through our position as the operating manager of other fund entities  or combinations thereof 
our arrangements are long term  and frequently have no specified termination dates 
however  our management arrangements with  or our position as general partner or operating manager of  an investment fund typically may be terminated by action taken by the investors 
upon any such termination  our management fees  after payment of any termination payments required  would cease  thereby reducing our expected future revenues 
we may have difficulty managing our asset portfolios under current market conditions 
current market conditions have increased the complexity of managing the assets held by us and our investment funds 
as a result  we depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational  financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures to deal effectively with the complexity of the conditions under which we operate 
we may not be able to implement improvements to our management information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls 
consequently  we may experience strains on our administrative and operations infrastructure  increasing our costs or reducing or eliminating our profitability 
our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover future losses 
at september   our allowance for possible credit losses was million on receivables from managed entities  primarily representing of the book value of the receivables from our commercial finance and real estate managed funds 
we cannot assure you that these allowances will prove to be sufficient to cover future losses  or that any future provisions for credit losses that we may record will not be materially greater than those we have recorded to date 
losses that exceed our allowance for credit losses  or cause an increase in our provision for credit losses  could materially reduce our earnings 

back to index 
back to index many of our assets are illiquid  and we may not be able to divest them in response to changing economic  financial and investment conditions 
many of our assets  including those of vies included in our consolidated financial statements  do not have ready markets 
moreover  we believe that the market for many of these assets  particularly real estate and cdo interests  has become more limited in the past several years due to recessionary and low growth economic conditions in the united states and elsewhere 
as a result  many of our portfolio assets are relatively illiquid investments 
we may be unable to vary our portfolio in response to changing economic  financial and investment conditions or to sell our investments on acceptable terms should we desire or need to do so 
we are subject to substantial competition in all aspects of our business 
our ability to sponsor investment funds depends upon our access to various distribution systems of national  regional and local securities firms  and our ability to locate and acquire appropriate assets for our investment funds 
we are subject to substantial competition in each area 
in the distribution area  our investment funds compete with those sponsored by other asset managers  which are being distributed through the same networks  as well as investments sponsored by the securities firms themselves 
while we have been successful in maintaining access to these distribution channels  we cannot assure you that we will continue to do so 
the inability to have continued access to our distribution channels could reduce the number of funds we sponsor and assets we manage  thereby impeding and possibly impairing our revenues and revenue growth 
in acquiring appropriate assets for our investment funds  we compete with numerous public and private investment entities  commercial banks  investment banks and other financial institutions  as well as industry participants  in each of our separate asset management areas 
many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
competition for desirable investments may result in higher costs and lower investment returns  and may delay our sponsorship of investment funds 
there are few economic barriers to entry in the asset management business 
our investment funds compete against an ever increasing number of investment and asset management products and services sponsored by investment banks  banks  insurance companies  financial services companies and others 
there are few economic barriers to entry into the investment or asset management industries and  as a result  we expect that competition for access to distribution channels and appropriate assets to acquire will increase 
our ability to realize our deferred tax asset may be reduced  which may adversely impact results of operations 
realization of a deferred tax asset requires us to exercise significant judgment and is inherently uncertain because it requires the prediction of future occurrences 
we may reduce our deferred tax asset in the future if estimates of projected income or our tax planning strategies do not support the amount of the deferred tax asset or due to unanticipated changes in future tax rates 
if we determine that a valuation allowance of our deferred tax asset is necessary  we may incur a charge to earnings 
the recently enacted dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act may be detrimental to our business 
we expect that the dodd frank act will have a significant impact on the financial services industry  and may particularly impact us with respect to increased compliance costs  hedging activities  our broker dealer operations and  possibly  our ability to obtain financing to increase our assets under management or revenues 
because much of the dodd frank act creates a framework through which regulatory reform will be promulgated  rather than providing regulatory reform itself  we cannot predict the magnitude of the effect that the dodd frank act will ultimately have on us 
failure to maintain adequate infrastructure could impede our productivity and growth 
our infrastructure  excluding our technological capacity  is important to our ability to conduct our operations 
failure to maintain an adequate infrastructure and to adapt it to growth we may achieve could harm our business operations  revenue  growth and profitability 

back to index 
back to index risks relating to particular aspects of our real estate  financial fund management and commercial finance operations as a result of current conditions in the global credit markets  our ability to sponsor investment entities and increase our assets under management may be limited 
our financial fund management business historically has consisted of the sponsorship and management of cdo issuers 
as a result of conditions in the global credit markets  sponsorship of new cdos was impracticable in fiscal and and was constrained significantly in fiscal moreover  our ability to sponsor investment funds in our commercial finance and real estate segments is significantly affected by our ability to obtain financing for the funds and the assets they acquire 
although in both fiscal and we were able to obtain financing necessary for us and our investment funds  we are aware that  in general  there has been a tightening of lending standards and a consequent reduction in credit availability 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain new financing or refinance existing financing in the future on acceptable financial terms  or at all 
an inability to obtain financing could limit or eliminate our ability to sponsor investment entities and increase our assets under management and  accordingly  impair our ability to generate asset management fees 
we typically have retained some portion or all of the equity in the cdos we sponsored 
cdo equity receives distributions from the cdo only if the cdo generates enough income to first pay the holders of the debt securities and the cdo s expenses 
we typically have retained some portion or all of the equity interest in cdos we sponsored either directly or through limited partnership investments 
the equity is usually entitled to all of the income generated by the cdo after the cdo pays all of the interest due on the debt securities and its other expenses  and is entitled to a return on capital only when the principal amount and accrued interest of all of the debt securities has been paid 
however  there will be little or no income available to the cdo equity if covenants regarding the operations of a cdo primarily relating to the value of collateral and interest coverage are not met  or if there are excessive payment defaults  payment deferrals or rating agency downgrades with respect to the issuers of the underlying collateral  and there may be little or no amounts available to return our capital 
in that event  the value of our direct or indirect investment in the cdo s equity  which for all cdos was approximately million at september   could decrease substantially or be eliminated 
in addition  the equity securities of cdos are generally illiquid  and because they represent a leveraged investment in the cdo s assets  the value of the equity securities will generally have greater fluctuations than the value of the underlying collateral 
in some of our investment funds  a portion of our management fees may depend upon the performance of the fund and  as a result  our management fee income may be volatile 
as of september   a portion of our management fees is subordinated to the investors receipt of specified returns in of the cdos we manage 
in addition  with respect to rcc and nine of our investment entities  we receive incentive or subordinated compensation in addition to our base management fee  depending upon whether rcc or those partnerships achieve returns above specified levels 
during fiscal and  we earned incentive and subordinated management fees from rcc and from and cdos  respectively  which constituted and  respectively  of our aggregate management fee income for both periods 
the continuing recessionary condition in the national economy may result in the amount of incentive or subordinated management fee income we receive being reduced or possibly eliminated  and may cause these fees to be subject to high volatility 
our real estate investment funds hold loans in their portfolios that are subject to a higher risk of loss than conventional mortgage loans 
the real estate investment funds that we have sponsored and manage  which we refer to as our rre funds  and from which we derive management and other fees  typically have loans in their portfolios that differ significantly from conventional mortgage loans 
in particular  these loans may be junior mortgage loans  involve payment structures other than equal periodic payments that retire a loan over its term  require the borrower to pay a large lump sum at loan maturity which will depend upon the borrower s ability to obtain financing or otherwise raise a substantial amount of cash at maturity  and while producing income  not generate sufficient revenues to pay the full amount of debt service on the loan as originally structured 
as a result  these real estate loans may have a higher risk of default and loss than conventional mortgage loans  and may require the rre funds to become involved in expensive and time consuming workouts  or bankruptcy  reorganization or foreclosure proceedings 

back to index 
back to index in addition  the principal or sole source of recovery for these real estate loans is typically the underlying property and  accordingly  the value of these loans  and the ability of the rre funds to collect loan payments will depend upon local  regional and national economic conditions  and conditions affecting the property specifically  including the cost of compliance with  and liability under environmental  health and safety laws  changes in interest rates and the availability of financing  casualty losses  the attractiveness of the property  the availability of tenants  the ability of tenants to pay rent  competition from similar properties in the area and neighborhood values 
operating and other expenses of real properties  particularly significant expenses such as real estate taxes  insurance and maintenance costs  generally do not decrease when revenues decrease and  even if revenues increase  operating and other expenses may increase faster than revenues 
accordingly  the revenues we derive from the rre funds may be negatively impacted 
we will likely incur losses from our retention of the management of four equipment partnership funds 
in fiscal  we transferred substantially all of our commercial finance operations to leaf and  in november  as a result of the november lcc transaction  we deconsolidated leaf  while retaining a minority interest in it 
however  we retained the obligation to manage four equipment leasing partnerships funds 
in connection therewith  we have entered into a subservicing agreement with leaf to service the leases held by these funds 
although we waived receipt of all future management fees  we are still obligated to pay subservicing fees to leaf 
the amount of our equity investment in leaf following the november lcc transaction will be reduced to the extent of leaf s losses 
following the november lcc transaction and resulting deconsolidation of leaf  the gaap value of our retained interest in leaf will be reduced by our equity in any losses subsequently incurred by leaf 
we anticipate that leaf will initially incur losses while it ramps up that business

in september  first community bank  or first community  filed a complaint against first tennessee bank and approximately thirty other defendants investment banks  rating agencies  collateral managers  including trapeza capital management  llc  or tcm  and issuers of cdos  including trapeza cdo xiii  ltd 
and trapeza cdo xiii  inc the complaint includes causes of action against tcm for fraud  negligent misrepresentation  violation of the tennessee securities act of and unjust enrichment 
first community alleges  among other things  that it invested in certain cdos  that the defendant rating agencies assigned inflated investment grade ratings to the cdos  and that the defendant investment banks  collateral managers and issuers including trapeza  fraudulently and or negligently made materially false and misleading representations and omissions that first community relied on in investing in the cdos  including both written representations in offering materials and unspecified oral representations 
specifically  with respect to trapeza  first community alleges that it purchased million of notes in the d tranche of the trapeza cdo xiii transaction from jp morgan

back to index item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a specialized asset management company that uses industry specific expertise to evaluate  originate  service and manage investment opportunities through our real estate  commercial finance and financial fund management sectors 
as a specialized asset manager  we seek to develop investment funds for outside investors for which we provide asset management services  typically under long term management arrangements either through a contract with  or as the manager or general partner of  our sponsored investment funds 
we typically maintain an investment in the funds we sponsor 
assets under management have grown from billion at september  to billion at september  we limit our fund development and management services to asset classes where we own existing operating companies or have specific expertise 
we believe this strategy enhances the return on investment we can achieve for our funds 
in our real estate operations  we concentrate on the ownership  operation and management of multifamily and commercial real estate and real estate mortgage loans including whole mortgage loans  first priority interests in commercial mortgage loans  known as a notes  subordinated interests in first mortgage loans  known as b notes  mezzanine loans  investments in discounted and distressed real estate loans and investments in value added properties properties which  although not distressed  need substantial improvements to reach their full investment potential 
in our commercial finance operations  we focus on originating small and middle ticket equipment leases and commercial loans secured by business essential equipment  including technology  commercial and industrial equipment and medical equipment 
in our financial fund management operations  we concentrate on trust preferred securities of banks  bank holding companies  insurance companies and other financial companies  bank loans and abs 
as a specialized asset manager  we are affected by conditions in the financial markets and  in particular  the continued volatility and reduced liquidity in the global credit markets which have reduced our revenues from  and the values of  many of the types of financial assets which we manage or own and have reduced our ability to access debt financing for our operations 
in our real estate segment  we have focused our efforts primarily on acquiring and managing a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate and real estate related debt that has been significantly discounted due to the effects of current economic conditions and high levels of leverage 
we expect to continue to expand this business by raising investor funds through our retail broker channel for investment programs  principally through rre opportunity reit 
we also continue to monetize our legacy real estate portfolio 
in conjunction with the june sale by the owner of a building in washington  dc in which we owned a interest  we received net proceeds of million including  that was released from escrow in october and recorded a gain on our investment of million 
in january  we contributed the leasing origination and servicing business platform of leaf financial into leaf to facilitate outside investment into the leasing business platform 
leaf will continue its focus on underwriting and originating small ticket and middle ticket equipment leases and commercial loan contracts 
leaf financial will continue the asset management business by managing our commercial finance leasing partnerships 
in the formation of leaf  resource capital corp 
nyse rso  or rcc  invested million of capital in the form of preferred stock 
a portion of rcc s investment consisted of the contribution of the leases and loans it had previously acquired from leaf financial 
in addition  guggenheim securities  llc  or guggenheim  arranged a new financing facility for leaf of up to million in revolving senior debt to fund new originations 
in conjunction with the contribution of the rcc portfolio  leaf financial reversed the servicing and repurchase liabilities it recorded in fiscal on certain lease and loan sales to rcc  and recognized a gain of million 
subsequent to our fiscal year end  on november   we obtained an additional outside investment in leaf by a third party private equity firm 
as a result of that investment  our equity interest in leaf is on a fully diluted basis 
accordingly  we determined that we no longer control leaf and  effective with that investment  we have deconsolidated it for financial reporting purposes 
on a go forward basis  we will reflect our investment in leaf on the equity method basis of accounting 
since fiscal  we have waived our management fees from our four sponsored and managed commercial finance investment funds due to their reduced equity distributions to their partners caused by the impact of the recession on the cash flow of these entities 
for fiscal and  we have waived million and million  respectively  in fees 
we have waived all future management fees  which will reduce our revenues and adversely affect our profitability 
in addition  we recognized a million and million provision for credit losses on the receivables due from these entities for fiscal and  respectively 

back to index 
back to index in our financial fund management segment  we continue to manage and receive fees from the collateralized debt obligation  or cdo  issuers that we had previously formed and sponsored 
in fiscal  we expect to continue to focus on managing our existing assets and  to the extent market conditions permit  expand our clo business 
in october  on behalf of rcc  we closed apidos clo viii  a million clo  for which we will receive asset management fees in the future 
in february  we entered into a services agreement with a subsidiary of rcc to provide subadvisory collateral management and administration services for five cdo issuers invested primarily in bank loans whose management contracts rcc had acquired 
this increased our assets under management by billion 
in december  we completed the sale of our management contract and equity investment in resource europe clo i  or rem i  for million and recognized a net gain of million 
in connection with the sale of a real estate loan in march  we agreed that  in exchange for the current property owner relinquishing certain control rights  we would make payments to the owner under certain circumstances as stipulated in the sale agreement 
in march  a triggering event as specified in the agreement occurred and  accordingly  we recorded a million liability for the present value of the payments due to the property owner and reflected the charge to discontinued operations 
the net loss attributable to common for fiscal was primarily driven by leaf s losses and the impairment of our receivables from the commercial finance managed entities 
accordingly  we recorded a net loss attributable to common shareholders of million in fiscal as compared to net losses attributable to common shareholders of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
assets under management we increased our assets under management by million to billion at september  from billion at september  the following table sets forth information relating to our assets under management by operating segment in millions  except percentages september  increase decrease amount percentage financial fund management real estate commercial finance for information on how we calculate assets under management  see the first table and related notes in item  business assets under management 
increase primarily related to subadvisory agreement with rcc billion  the awarding of the management contract for an existing cdo issuer with million of assets  and a million increase in bank loans managed for rcc while apidos viii is in its warehouse period 
these increases were offset  in part  primarily by the following i the sale of our collateral management rights and responsibilities with respect to rem i million in december and ii a decrease in the eligible collateral bases of our abs million and trust preferred portfolios million resulting from defaults  paydowns  sales and calls 
reduction primarily reflects the decrease in new originations and paydowns of existing leases and loans

we formed rre opportunity reit  which will further invest in discounted commercial real estate and real estate related debt 
the public offering for this fund commenced in june through september   rre opportunity reit raised million through its public and private offerings  acquired one property and eight notes  foreclosed on three loans  and has received a discounted settlement payment on one loan 
for fiscal  we expect that our primary fundraising efforts will be focused on rre opportunity reit 
through our real estate segment  we focus on four different areas the acquisition  ownership and management of portfolios of discounted real estate and real estate related debt  which we have acquired through two sponsored real estate investment entities as well as through joint ventures with institutional investors  the sponsorship and management of real estate investment entities that principally invest in multifamily housing  the management  principally for rcc  of general investments in commercial real estate debt  including first mortgage debt  whole loans  mortgage participations  b notes  mezzanine debt and related commercial real estate securities  and to a significantly lesser extent  the management and resolution of a portfolio of real estate loans and property interests that we acquired at various times between and  which we collectively refer to as our legacy portfolio

because we controlled leaf  its results are included in our financial statements for fiscal and we discuss those results in this section 
however  as a result of the november lcc transaction  we determined that we no longer control leaf and  accordingly  it will be deconsolidated from our financial statements for fiscal and subsequent fiscal years  with our retained interest being accounted for on the equity method of accounting 
new equipment originations for fiscal were million as compared to million for fiscal our goal as the asset managers for our investment partnerships is to preserve partnership capital and to achieve the best possible results for those investors

we believe that  as a result  cash flows in these partnerships may improve  which will help pay down loans and generate liquidity for investments in new leases  and negotiated with the partnerships lenders to keep them from foreclosing on partnership collateral 
the commercial finance assets we managed for our own account at september  increased by million to million as compared to million at september  the assets we managed for others  at september  decreased by million to million as compared to million at september  excluding assets managed for rcc primarily due to the natural runoff of the lease portfolios owned by the respective investment partnerships

revenues fiscal compared to fiscal revenues decreased million to million for fiscal as compared million for fiscal we attribute these decreases primarily to the following a million decrease in management fees 
in fiscal  we began waiving certain management fees from our commercial finance investment partnerships due to their reduced equity distributions as a result of the impact of the recession on their respective cash flows 
in fiscal  we waived million of these fees as compared to million in fiscal  and a million decrease in asset acquisition fees 
the difficulty in obtaining and maintaining debt financing by the investment funds we manage coupled with certain of those funds entering maturity phases has limited their ability to acquire equipment financings from us 
consequently  we reduced our commercial finance originations to match their asset acquisition capabilities 
these decreases were partially offset by the following an million increase in finance revenues due to the million increase in the portfolio of assets held for our own account  reflecting the contribution of the rcc portfolio to leaf in january in addition to our ongoing lease and loan originations  a million decrease in equity losses on unconsolidated partnerships  reflecting a decrease in the provision for credit losses by our investment partnerships and a non recurring gain on the extinguishment of debt  and a  increase in other income  primarily due to an increase in the insurance fees we generated

accordingly  we netted the idc capitalization of million and million  respectively  against the corresponding acquisition fees we recorded from the partnerships at the time of sale to the investment partnerships 
commencing in fiscal  we have maintained the commercial assets we acquired on our balance sheet and  therefore  have reflected the capitalization of idc costs separately as a reduction of our general and administrative expenses 
these decreases was partially offset by the following a million increase in wage and benefit costs  primarily driven by a reduction in the amount of costs and that we could allocate to our managed investment partnerships 
revenues fiscal compared to fiscal revenues decreased million from million for fiscal as compared million for fiscal we attribute these decreases primarily to the following a million decrease in commercial finance revenues during fiscal the decreases were caused by the reduction in the size of the portfolio of commercial finance assets managed for our own account primarily due to the sale of commercial finance assets to rcc  a million decrease in asset acquisition fees during fiscal the difficulty in obtaining and maintaining debt financing by the investment funds we manage has limited their ability to acquire equipment financings from us

the decline in fund management fees during fiscal was caused primarily by a waiver of the fees we earn to manage the commercial finance assets  lower offering fees received as leaf equipment finance fund  our most recently sponsored investment entity  closed its offering in october  and finally  due to the lower fees as a result of the previously discussed reduction in the portfolio of leases and loans held by our investment entities 
a  increase in equity losses during fiscal  reflecting an increase in the provision for credit losses recorded by our investment entities 
the negative impact of the economic recession in the united states on the ability of our investment funds customers to make payments on their leases and loans  has accordingly  increased our exposure from non performing assets  and other income decreased  during fiscal principally due to the decrease in customer service charges 
these fees typically vary widely from period to period and are driven by the amount and seasoning of commercial finance assets held by us 
costs and expenses fiscal compared to fiscal costs and expenses from our commercial finance operations decreased by million for fiscal we attribute this decrease primarily to the following a million reduction in wage and benefit costs during fiscal in response to lower origination volume and assets under management  we have reduced payroll and other overhead costs and have continued to eliminate redundant positions 
in total  we have reduced the number of full time employees in our commercial finance operations by to at september  from at september   and a reduction in other costs and expenses of million during fiscal the decrease reflects the reduction in costs  primarily legal  to service our smaller portfolio of assets  as well as our ongoing cost saving and consolidation efforts which targeted eliminating overhead redundancies and increasing operating efficiencies

back to index fiscal compared to fiscal interest expense incurred by our commercial finance operations increased by million primarily due to the million increase in weighted average borrowings as compared to fiscal in the january leaf transaction  we consolidated million of equipment backed notes  net of a discount  and obtained a million revolving credit facility with guggenheim  replacing the million of short term bridge financing 
fiscal compared to fiscal interest expense incurred by our commercial finance operations decreased by million for fiscal  primarily reflecting a decrease in average borrowings of million 
during fiscal  our borrowing capacity on our commercial finance warehouse facility decreased and in may  the line was fully repaid and terminated 
in march  we sold a million portfolio of leases held by lcff and  thereby  eliminated million of corresponding debt 
the decrease in average borrowings was offset  in part  by a million increase in amortization of deferred finance fees for the commercial finance facilities 
corporate interest expense increased by million for fiscal  principally reflecting million of interest expense related to the senior notes issued in september and october  of which million was amortization of the debt discount related to the cost of the warrants issued with the notes 
this increase was offset  in part  by a million decrease in fiscal average borrowings under our corporate secured credit facilities resulting in a million decrease in interest expense 
the sale of our equity interest and resulting deconsolidation of apidos cdo vi in march removed its senior notes from our balance sheet

our ability to meet our liquidity needs will be subject to our ability to generate cash from operations  and  with respect to our investments  our ability to raise investor funds and to obtain debt financing 
however  the availability of any such financing will depend on market conditions 
we also may seek to obtain liquidity through the disposition discussed below of non strategic investments  including our legacy real estate portfolio

clawback liability 
two financial fund management investment entities that have incentive distributions  also known as carried interests  are structured so that there is a clawback of previously paid incentive distributions to the extent that such distributions exceed the cumulative net profits of the entities  as defined in the respective partnership agreements 
on november  and january   we  along with the co manager of the general partner of those investment entities  repurchased substantially all the remaining limited partnership interests in these two partnerships  significantly reducing our potential clawback liability 
the clawback liability we recorded was million at september  and legal proceedings 
see item  legal proceedings 
general corporate commitments 
as a specialized asset manager  we sponsor investment funds in which we may make an equity investment along with outside investors 
this equity investment is generally based on a percentage of funds raised and varies among investment programs 
with respect to rre opportunity reit  we are committed to invest of the equity raised by to a maximum amount of million 
in july  we entered into an agreement with one of the tic programs we sponsored and manage 
this agreement requires us to fund up to million for capital improvements for the tic property over the next two years 
as of september   we had advanced funds totaling million 
we are also a party to employment agreements with certain executives that provide for compensation and other benefits  including severance payments under specified circumstances 
as of september   except for the clawback liability recorded for the two trapeza entities and executive compensation  we do not believe it is probable that any payments will be required under any of our commitments and contingencies  and accordingly  no liabilities for these obligations have been recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we make estimates of our allowance for credit losses  the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  discounts and collectability of management fees  the valuation of stock based compensation  servicing liability and repurchase obligation  allowance for lease and loan losses  and in determining whether a decrease in the fair value of an investment is an other than temporary impairment 
significant estimates for the commercial finance segment include the unguaranteed residual values of leased equipment  impairment of long lived assets and goodwill and the fair value and effectiveness of interest rate swaps 
the financial fund management segment makes assumptions in determining the fair value of our investments in securities available for sale and in estimating the liability  if any  for clawback provisions on certain of our partnership interests 
we used assumptions  specifically inputs to the black scholes pricing model and the discounted cash flow model  in computing the fair value of the senior notes and related warrants 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
stock based compensation we value the restricted stock we issue based on the closing price of our stock on the date of grant 
for stock option awards  we determine the fair value by applying the black scholes pricing model 
these equity awards are amortized to compensation expense over the respective vesting periods  less an estimate for forfeitures 

back to index 
back to index financing receivables receivables from managed entities 
we perform a review of the collectability of our receivables from managed entities on a periodic basis 
if upon review there is an indication of impairment  we will analyze the future cash flows of the managed entity 
with respect to the receivables from our commercial finance investment partnerships  this takes into consideration several assumptions by management  specifically concerning estimations of future bad debts and recoveries 
for the receivables from the real estate investment entities for which there are indications of impairment  we estimate the cash flows through the sale of the underlying properties  which is based on projected net operating income as a multiple of published capitalization rates  which is then reduced by the underlying mortgage balances and priority distributions due to the investors in the entity 
investments in commercial finance 
our investments in commercial finance consist primarily of direct financing leases  equipment loans  and operating leases 
direct financing leases 
certain of our lease transactions are accounted for as direct financing leases as distinguished from operating leases 
such leases transfer substantially all benefits and risks of equipment ownership to the customer 
our investment in direct financing leases consists of the sum of the total future minimum contracted payments receivable and the estimated unguaranteed residual value of leased equipment  less unearned finance income 
unearned finance income  which is recognized as revenue over the term of the financing by the effective interest method  represents the excess of the total future minimum lease payments plus the estimated unguaranteed residual value expected to be realized at the end of the lease term over the cost of the related equipment 
initial direct costs incurred in the consummation of the lease are capitalized as part of the investment in lease receivables and amortized over the lease term as a reduction of the yield 
we discontinue recognizing revenue for lease and loans for which payments are more than days past due 
fees from delinquent payments are recognized when received 
equipment loans 
for term loans  the investment consists of the sum of the total future minimum loan payments receivable less unearned finance income 
unearned finance income  which is recognized as revenue over the term of the financing by the effective interest method  represents the excess of the total future minimum contracted payments over the original cost of the loan 
for all other loans  interest income is recorded at the stated rate on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected 
operating leases 
leases not meeting any of the criteria to be classified as direct financing leases are deemed to be operating leases 
under the accounting for operating leases  the cost of the leased equipment  including acquisition fees associated with lease placements  is recorded as an asset and depreciated on a straight line basis over the equipment s estimated useful life  generally up to seven years 
rental income consists primarily of monthly periodic rental payments due under the terms of the leases 
we recognize rental income on a straight line basis 
during the lease term of existing operating leases  we may not recover all of the cost and related expenses of our rental equipment and  therefore  we are prepared to remarket the equipment in future years 
our policy is to review  on at least a quarterly basis  the expected economic life of our rental equipment in order to determine the recoverability of its undepreciated cost 
we write down our rental equipment to its estimated net realizable value when it is probable that its carrying amount exceeds such value and the excess can be reasonably estimated  gains are only recognized upon actual sale of the rental equipment 
there were no write downs of equipment during fiscal   and future payment card receivables 
additionally  we have provided capital advances to small businesses based on future credit card receipts 
the entire portfolio of future payment card receivables is on the cost recovery method whereby no income is recognized until the basis of the future payment card receivable has been fully recovered 
allowance for credit losses 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses in commercial finance including investments in leases and loans and future payment card receivables based upon  among other factors  management s historical experience with the commercial finance portfolios we manage  an analysis of contractual delinquencies  economic conditions and trends  industry statistics and equipment finance portfolio characteristics  as adjusted for expected recoveries 
in evaluating historic performance of leases and loans  we perform a migration analysis  which estimates the likelihood that an account progresses through delinquency stages to ultimate write off 
we fully reserves  net of recoveries  all leases and loans after they are days past due 
commercial finance receivables whose terms are modified are classified as troubled debt restructurings if we grant such borrowers concessions and it is deemed that those borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty 
concessions granted under a troubled debt restructuring typically involve a temporary deferral of scheduled payments  an extension of a commercial financial receivable s stated maturity date or a reduction in interest rate 
non accrual troubled debt restructurings can be restored to accrual status if principal and interest payments  under the modified terms  become current subsequent to the modification 
troubled debt restructurings are included in the migration analysis for our commercial finance investments when evaluating the allowance for credit losses 

back to index 
back to index investment securities our investment securities available for sale  including investments in the cdo issuers we sponsored  are carried at fair value 
the fair value of the cdo investments is based primarily on internally generated expected cash flow models that require significant management judgment and estimates due to the lack of market activity and the use of unobservable pricing inputs 
investments in affiliated entities  including holdings in tbbk and rcc  are valued at the closing price of the respective publicly traded stock 
the fair value of the cumulative net unrealized gains and losses on these investment securities  net of tax  is reported through accumulated other comprehensive income and loss 
realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on the trade date on the basis of specific identification and are included in net operating results 
we recognize a realized loss when it is probable there has been an adverse change in estimated cash flows from what previously had been estimated 
the security is then written down to fair value  and the unrealized loss is transferred from accumulated other comprehensive loss to the consolidated statements of operations as a charge to current earnings 
the cost basis adjustment for an other than temporary impairment would be recoverable only upon the sale or maturity of the security 
periodically  we review the carrying value of our available for sale securities 
if we deem an unrealized loss to be other than temporary  we will record an impairment charge 
our process for identifying an other than temporary decline in the fair value of our investments involves consideration of i the duration of a significant decline in value  ii the liquidity  business prospects and overall financial condition of the issuer  iii the magnitude of the decline  iv the collateral structure and other credit support  as applicable  and v the more than likely intention to hold the investment until the value recovers 
additionally  with respect to our evaluation of our investment in rcc  we also take into consideration our role as the external manager and the value of its management contract  which includes a substantial termination fee 
when the analysis of the above factors results in a conclusion that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  we record an impairment charge and the cost of our investment is written down to fair value 
our trading securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses included in earnings and reported in other income 
these securities are valued at the closing price of the respective publicly traded stock 
we recognize dividend income on our investment securities classified as available for sale on the ex dividend date 
accounting for income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and to recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
we adjust the balance of our deferred taxes to reflect the tax rates at which future taxable amounts will likely be settled or realized 
the effects of tax rate changes on deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets  as well as other changes in income tax laws  are recognized in net earnings in the period during which such changes are enacted 
valuation allowances are established and adjusted  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
we assess our ability to realize deferred tax assets primarily based on the earnings history and future earnings potential of the legal entities through which the deferred tax assets will be realized 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets have an indefinite life and are not amortized 
instead  a review for impairment is performed at least annually on may st or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate impairment might have occurred 
we test our goodwill at the reporting unit level using a two step process 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to a reporting unit  goodwill is considered not impaired and no further testing is required 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  step two is completed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
in step two  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to its carrying amount 
the implied fair value of goodwill is computed by subtracting the sum of the fair values of the individual asset categories tangible and intangible from the indicated fair value of the reporting unit as determined under step one 
an impairment charge is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
we utilize several approaches  including discounted expected cash flows  market data and comparable sales transactions to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit for our impairment review of goodwill 
these approaches require assumptions and estimates of many critical factors  including revenue and market growth  operating cash flows  market multiples  and discount rates  which are based on the current economic environment and credit market conditions 

back to index 
back to index we have goodwill of million  which was transferred to leaf in the january transaction 
we test this goodwill annually in may for impairment 
based on a third party valuation  we concluded that  as of may   there has been no impairment of our goodwill 
long lived assets and identifiable intangibles with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
in fiscal  we acquired customer relationships with third party lease originators  which is classified as a customer related intangible asset 
we had been amortizing the intangible asset over the expected useful life of the asset and had continually monitored it for recoverability 
during the three months ended september   we determined that this asset ceased to have future value  and accordingly  recorded an impairment loss of million 
derivative instruments our policies permit us to enter into derivative contracts  including interest rate swaps to add stability to our financing costs and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks 
we have designed these transactions as cash flow hedges 
the contracts or hedge instruments are evaluated at inception and at subsequent balance sheet dates to determine if they continue to qualify for hedge accounting and  accordingly  derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value 
us gaap requires recognition of all derivatives at fair value as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
we record changes in the estimated fair value of the derivative in accumulated other comprehensive income loss to the extent that it is effective 
any ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
recent accounting standards accounting standards issued but not yet effective the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  has issued the following accounting standards  which were not yet effective for us as of september  testing goodwill for impairment 
in december and again in september  the fasb issued guidance with respect to testing goodwill for impairment 
in connection with the november lcc transaction see note to the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report and resulting deconsolidation of leaf  we will no longer reflect goodwill on our balance sheet 
accordingly  these amendments will not have an impact on our financial statements 
comprehensive income loss 
in june  the fasb issued an amendment to eliminate the option to present components of other comprehensive income loss as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the amendment requires that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income loss or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in the two statement approach  the first statement should present total net income loss and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income loss  the components of other comprehensive income loss  and the total of comprehensive income loss 
we plan to provide the disclosures as required by this amendment beginning october  fair value measurements 
in may  the fasb issued an amendment to revise the wording used to describe the requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
for many of the requirements  the fasb does not intend for the amendments to result in a change in the application of the current requirements 
some of the amendments clarify the fasb s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements  such as specifying that the concepts of highest and best use and valuation premise in a fair value measurement are relevant only when measuring the fair value of nonfinancial assets 
other amendments change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements such as specifying that  in the absence of a level input  a reporting entity should apply premiums or discounts when market participants would do so when pricing the asset or liability 
this guidance will become effective for us beginning january  we are currently evaluating the impact this amendment will have  if any  on our financial statements 

back to index 
back to index newly adopted accounting principles the adoption of the following standards during fiscal did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows troubled debt restructurings 
in fiscal  the fasb issued guidance that requires the disclosure of more detailed information on the nature and extent of troubled debt restructurings and their effect on the allowance for loan and lease losses 
in april  the fasb issued additional guidance related to determining whether a creditor has granted a concession  including factors and examples for creditors to consider in evaluating whether a restructuring results in a delay in payment that is insignificant  prohibits creditors from using the borrower s effective rate test to evaluate whether a concession has been granted to the borrower  and adds factors for creditors to use in determining whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties 
transfers of financial assets 
in june  the fasb amended prior guidance on accounting for transfers of financial assets 
the new pronouncement changes the derecognition guidance for the transferors of financial assets  eliminates the exemption from consolidation for qualifying special purpose entities and requires additional disclosures about all transfers of financial assets 
disclosure about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses 
in july  the fasb issued guidance that requires companies to provide more information about the credit quality of their financing receivables including  but not limited to  significant purchases and sales of financing receivables  aging information and credit quality indicators 
we have provided the required disclosures in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
variable interest entities 
in june  the fasb issued guidance to revise the approach to determine when a vie should be consolidated 
the new consolidation model for vies considers whether the company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie s economic performance and shares in the significant risks and rewards of the entity 
the guidance on vies requires companies to continually reassess vies to determine if consolidation is appropriate and to provide additional disclosures

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following is a discussion of our quantitative and qualitative market risks as of september  given the deconsolidation of leaf in november  as discussed in item of this report  we have separately presented the market risks associated with our commercial finance operations as these risks will be eliminated in our subsequent filings 
interest rate risk we are exposed to various market risks from changes in interest rates 
fluctuations in interest rates can impact our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
we manage this risk through regular operating and financing activities 
we have not entered into any market sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market interest rates 
the range of changes presented reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period and provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
our analysis does not consider other possible effects that could impact our business 
at september   we had two secured revolving credit facilities and one term loan for general business use 
weighted average borrowings on these facilities were million for fiscal at an effective interest rate of on outstanding borrowings 
a hypothetical change in the interest rate on these facilities would change our annual interest expense by  our million of senior notes are at a fixed rate of interest and are  therefore  not subject to interest rate fluctuation 
commercial finance market risks market risk 
market risk is the risk of losses arising from changes in values of financial instruments 
we are exposed to market risks associated with changes in interest rates and our earnings may fluctuate with changes in interest rates 
the lease assets we originate are almost entirely fixed rate 
accordingly  we seek to finance these assets with fixed interest rate debt or to fix interest rates through derivatives 
interest rate risk 
at september   we had commercial finance debt outstanding of million  of which million is through the guggenheim credit facility and is at a variable interest rate 
accordingly  to mitigate interest rate risk on the variable rate debt  we employed a hedging strategy using derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  which effectively fixed the interest rate on this facility at on a weighted average basis 
at september   the notional amounts of our four interest rate swaps were million
