table of contents revenues we generate a substantial portion of our revenues on a per transaction basis  most of which is derived from contracts that extend up to months from execution 
for the years ended december  and  we derived approximately and  respectively  of our revenues from transactions processed and subscription arrangements 
the remainder of our revenues was generated by professional services and licenses 
historically  our revenues have been directly impacted by the number of transactions processed 
in recent years  the fourth quarter has had the highest volume of transactions processed due to increased consumer activation activity during the holiday season 
the future success of our business depends on the continued growth of consumer and business transactions and  as such  the volume of transactions that we process could fluctuate on a quarterly basis

current trends affecting our results of operations our on demand business model enables delivery of our proprietary solutions over the web as a service and has been driven by market trends such as various forms of order provisioning  local number portability  the implementation of new technologies  subscriber growth  competitive churn  network changes  growth of the emerging device market ie  smartphone devices  netbooks  etc 
and consolidations in the industry 
in particular  the emergence of order provisioning of e commerce transactions for smartphone devices  wireless  voip  lnp  and other communication services surrounding the convergence of bundled services has increased the need for our services and we believe will continue to be a source of growth for us 
to support the growth driven by the favorable industry trends mentioned above  we continue to look for opportunities to improve our operating efficiencies  such as the utilization of offshore technical and non technical resources for our exception handling center management 
we believe that these opportunities will continue to provide future benefits and position us to support revenue growth 
in addition  we anticipate further automation of the transactions generated by our more mature customers and additional transaction types 
our cost of services can fluctuate from period to period based upon the level of automation and the on boarding of new transaction types

we are also exploring additional opportunities through merger and acquisition activities to support our customer  product and geographic diversification strategies 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a fiscal period 
the securities and exchange commission sec considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to a company s financial condition and results of operations  and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
we have discussed the selection and development of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this report on form k 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate  correct and reasonable under the circumstances  actual results may differ from those estimates 
we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain 
if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected 
see risk factors for certain matters bearing risks on our future results of operations 

table of contents revenue recognition and deferred revenue we provide services principally on a transactional basis or  at times  on a fixed fee basis and recognize the revenues as the services are performed or delivered as discussed below transactional service arrangements transaction revenues consist of revenues derived from the processing of transactions through our service platforms and represented approximately of our revenue for the year ended december  and of our revenues for the years ended december  and transaction service arrangements include services such as equipment orders  new account set up and activation  number port requests  credit checks and inventory management 
transaction revenues are principally based on a set price per transaction and are recognized based on the number of transactions processed during each reporting period 
revenues are recorded based on the total number of transactions processed at the applicable price established in the relevant contract 
the total amount of revenues recognized is based primarily on the volume of transactions 
in many cases as the automation rates increase  transaction costs for our customer decreases 
many of our contracts guarantee minimum volume transactions from the customer 
in these instances  if the customer s total transaction volume for the period is less than the contractual amount  we record revenues at the minimum guaranteed amount 
at times  transaction revenues may also include billings to customers based on the number of individuals dedicated to processing transactions 
set up fees for transactional service arrangements are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the contract since these amounts would not have been paid by the customer without the related transactional service arrangement 
revenues are presented net of discounts  which are volume level driven  or credits  which are performance driven  and are determined in the period in which the volume thresholds are met or the services are provided 
professional service arrangements professional service revenues represented approximately   and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
professional services  when sold with transactional service arrangements  are accounted for separately when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the professional services 
when accounted for separately  professional service revenues are recognized on a monthly basis  as services are performed and all other elements of revenue recognition have been satisfied 
in determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from transaction service revenues  we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement availability of the professional services from other vendors  whether objective and reliable evidence for fair value exists of the undelivered elements  the nature of the professional services  the timing of when the professional contract was signed in comparison to the transaction service start date and the contractual independence of the transactional service from the professional services 
if a professional service arrangement were not to qualify for separate accounting  we would recognize the professional service revenues ratably over the remaining term of the transaction contract 
there were no such arrangements for the years ended december   and software license arrangements software license arrangements represented approximately of our revenues for the year ended and primarily related to our network address book software  a component part of our convergencenow plus tm platform which we acquired from fusionone 
we recognize revenues when the license is delivered to our customers 
when arrangements include multiple elements  we allocate the total fee among the various elements using the residual method 
under the residual method  revenue is recognized when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements of the arrangement  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements of the arrangement 
judgment is also involved in determining whether vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements exists 
such judgments can impact the amount of revenue that we record in a given period 
while we follow specific and detailed rules and guidelines related to revenue recognition  we make and use management judgments and estimates in connection with the revenue recognized in any reporting period  particularly in the areas described above  as well as 
table of contents collectability 
if management made different estimates or judgments  differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue could occur 
subscription service arrangements subscription service arrangements represented approximately of our revenues for the year ended december  and of our revenues for the years ended december  and  and relate principally to our activationnow platform service which the customer accesses through a graphical user interface and maintenance agreements on our software license 
we record revenues on a straight line basis over the life of the contract for our subscription service and maintenance contracts 
deferred revenue deferred revenues primarily represent billings to customers for services in advance of the performance of services  with revenues recognized as the services are rendered  and also includes the fair value of deferred revenues recorded as a result of the fusionone acquisition 
service level standards pursuant to certain contracts  we are subject to service level standards and to corresponding penalties for failure to meet those standards 
all performance related penalties are reflected as a corresponding reduction of our revenues 
these penalties  if applicable  are recorded in the month incurred and were not significant for the years ended december   and allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated bad debts resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the amount of the allowance account is based on historical experience and our analysis of the accounts receivable balance outstanding 
while credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit losses that we have in the past or that our reserves will be adequate 
if the financial condition of one of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in its inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would result in an additional expense in the period that this determination was made 
income taxes we account for the effects of income taxes that result from our activities during the current and preceding years 
under this method  deferred income tax liabilities and assets are based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse or be utilized 
the realization of deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not that a portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as of december   and we had total unrecognized tax benefit reserves of thousand and thousand which includes thousand and thousand for accumulated interest related to uncertain positions  respectively 
components of the reserve are classified as either current or long term in the consolidated balance sheet based on when we expect each of the items to be settled 
accordingly  we recorded a long term liability for unrecognized tax benefits of thousand and a short term liability of thousand on the balance sheet at december  that would reduce the effective tax rate if recognized 
we record interest and penalties accrued in relation to uncertain income tax positions below the operating income line as a component of interest expense 
tax returns for years and thereafter are subject to future examination by tax authorities 
in  the net decrease in the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits was thousand and the net decrease for interest benefit was thousand 
we expect that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change during fiscal year  however  we do not expect the change to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
while we believe we have identified all reasonably identifiable exposures and that the reserve we have established for identifiable exposures is appropriate under the circumstances  it is possible that additional exposures exist and that exposures may be settled at amounts different than the amounts reserved 
it is also possible that 
table of contents changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to either materially increase or reduce the carrying amount of our tax reserves 
stock based compensation as of december   we maintain three stock based compensation plans 
compensation cost is recognized for all share based payments granted and is based on the grant date fair value estimated using the weighted average assumption of the black scholes option pricing models 
the equity instrument is not considered to be issued until the instrument vests 
as a result  compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period with an offsetting credit to additional paid in capital 
compensation expense also includes the amortization on a straight line basis over the remaining vesting period of the intrinsic values of the stock options granted prior to for our performance restricted stock awards we determine the actual number of shares the recipient receives at the end of the annual performance period based on the results achieved versus goals based on our annual performance targets  such as operating income 
once the number of awards is determined  the compensation cost is fixed and continues to be recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
in addition  certain employees from our acquisition of fusionone are eligible to receive contingent earn out payments 
the share portion of the earn out is recorded as stock based compensation expense and is recorded over the performance period when it is probable that the performance targets will be achieved 
this compensation cost will be fixed at the end of the earn out period  and therefore  is subject to volatility based on our stock price 
we classify benefits of tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized excess tax benefits as a financing cash inflow with a corresponding operating cash outflow 
we included million  thousand and million of excess tax benefits as a financing cash inflow for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model for determining the estimated fair value for stock based awards 
use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs 
expected volatility was calculated based on a blended weighted average of historical information of similar public entities for which historical information was available 
we will continue to use the approach of using other similar public entity volatility information until our historical volatility is relevant to measure expected volatility for future option grants 
the average expected life was determined using the mid point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant 
we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common or preferred equity and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
forfeitures are estimated based on voluntary termination behavior  as well as a historical analysis of actual option forfeitures 
the weighted average assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model are as follows for the year ended december  expected stock price volatility risk free interest rate expected life of options in years expected dividend yield the weighted average fair value as of the date of grant of the options granted was  and per share for the year ended december   and  respectively 
the total stock based compensation cost related to non vested equity awards not yet recognized as an expense as of december  was approximately million 
during october  the compensation committee of our board of directors approved amendments to stock options held by certain employees to permit transferability of such options to family members 
as a result of the amendments  options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock no longer qualify as 
table of contents incentive stock options under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
accordingly  we treated the amended stock options as if they were non qualified stock options since inception  which resulted in a deferred tax asset of approximately million 
also  there was no incremental compensation cost associated with each amended stock option resulting from the measurement of the excess of the fair value of the stock option immediately following its amendment over the fair value of the stock option immediately prior to its amendment based on the share price and other pertinent factors at that date 
business combinations we account for business combinations in accordance with the acquisition method 
the acquisition method of accounting requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at their fair values on the date of a business acquisition 
our consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business from the completion date of an acquisition 
the judgments that we make in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as asset lives  can materially impact net income in periods following a business combination 
we generally use either the income  cost or market approach to aid in our conclusions of such fair values and asset lives 
the income approach presumes that the value of an asset can be estimated by the net economic benefit to be received over the life of the asset  discounted to present value 
the cost approach presumes that an investor would pay no more for an asset than its replacement or reproduction cost 
the market approach estimates value based on what other participants in the market have paid for reasonably similar assets 
although each valuation approach is considered in valuing the assets acquired  the approach ultimately selected is based on the characteristics of the asset and the availability of information 
for acquisitions completed after january   we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date 
each reporting period thereafter  we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to net change in contingent consideration obligation within the consolidated statement of income 
changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation can result from updates in the achievement of financial targets and changes to the weighted probability of achieving those future financial targets 
significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period 
accordingly  any change in the assumptions described above could have a material impact on the amount of the net change in contingent consideration obligation that we record in any given period 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired  including other definite lived intangible assets 
goodwill is not amortized  but reviewed annually for impairment or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we performed our annual impairment test noting no impairment  and we do not believe we are at risk for impairment 
the change in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended december  is as follows balance at december  acquired goodwill balance at december

selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenues increased to for  as compared to for depreciation and amortization

we review the expected annual effective income tax rate and make changes on a quarterly basis as necessary based on certain factors such as changes in forecasted annual operating income  changes to the actual and forecasted permanent book to tax differences  or changes resulting from the impact of a tax law change 
in  
table of contents our effective tax rate was higher than our us federal statutory rate primarily due to the unfavorable tax impact of the fair market value adjustment for the contingent consideration obligation related to the earn out for the fusionone equity holders  the nondeductible transaction costs related to the fusionone acquisition  and other nondeductible items including gaap compensation expense for incentive stock options 
in addition  the tax rate increase from the prior year is also impacted by the expiration of the tax holiday in india and increased state taxes due to more contracts being performed in those locations 
we expect to be exposed to fluctuations in our effective rate during the fusionone earn out period for our contingent consideration liability 
due to the nature of this transaction we may experience significant adjustments to fair value of the contingent consideration obligation depending on the outcome of the quarterly achievements 
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits for the twelve months ended december  is as follows unrecognized tax benefit at december  additions for tax positions of prior periods decreases for tax positions of prior periods additions for tax positions of current periods reductions related to the expiration of statutes of limitations unrecognized tax benefit at december  year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the following table presents an overview of our results of operations for the years ended december  and year ended december  of of vs revenue revenue change change in thousands net revenue cost of services research and development selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization income from operations cost of services excludes depreciation which is shown separately

net income for the quarters ended september  and december   included a change in contingent consideration obligation of million and million  respectively 
net income for the quarter ended december  included a tax benefit resulting from the amendment of  shares of our incentive stock options 
liquidity and capital resources in  our principal source of liquidity was cash provided by operations and our secondary offering 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance was million at december   an increase of million as compared to the end of this increase was primarily due to the million in net proceeds received from our secondary stock offering on november  and from cash provided by operations offset by million in cash used for the acquisition of fusionone 
we anticipate that our principal uses of cash in the future will be to fund the expansion of our business through both organic growth as well as possible acquisition activities and the expansion of our customer base internationally 
uses of cash will also include facility expansion  capital expenditures and working capital 
in may  we entered into an agreement to lease space for our pennsylvania offices and data center in a newly constructed facility 
the lease has a term of years and months with an option to extend the term of the lease for two consecutive five year periods 
in august  we amended the lease whereby we agreed to reimburse the landlord for certain leasehold improvements we had requested 
the construction phase of the building was complete as of june  since the tenant improvements  under the lease amendment  are considered structural in nature and we are responsible for reimbursement to the landlord for the cost of these improvements we are considered to be the owner of the construction project for accounting purposes 
we recorded assets on our balance sheet for all of the costs paid by the lessor to construct the pennsylvania facility through december   along with corresponding financing liabilities for amounts equal to these lessor paid construction costs through december  post construction period accounting requires determination of a portion of the monthly lease payments to be construed as interest  
table of contents depreciation  and principal payments 
at december   we had recorded million of construction costs funded by the landlord  with an offsetting amount recorded as financing liabilities 
the lease did not qualify for a sale lease back treatment and therefore the lease was treated as a financing lease 
for the year ended december   we recorded thousand and thousand of interest expense and depreciation expense  respectively  related to the lease agreement 
discussion of cash flows year ended december   compared to the year ended december  cash flows from operations

we also make cash payments related to taxes and leased facilities 
during the year ended december  we also made payments of approximately million related to our fusionone related acquisition transaction costs 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  of million as compared to is primarily due to the change in working capital which included a million increase in our accounts receivable balance as our collection of customer accounts only partially offset the increase of million in customer sales and a million increase in our accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the accounts payable and accrued expenses accounts grew partially due to increased expenses necessary to support higher revenues as well as the up front costs associated with the design  business process flow and planning related to the on boarding of new business channels within our existing customers

impact of recently issued accounting standards in september  the fasb issued accounting standard update asu no 
certain revenue arrangements that include software elements this standard requires tangible products that contain software and non software elements that work together to deliver the products essential functionality to be evaluated under the accounting standard regarding multiple deliverable arrangements 
this standard update is effective january  and may be adopted prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after the date of adoption or retrospectively for all revenue arrangements for all periods presented 
we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements or disclosures 
in october  the fasb issued asu no 
multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force 
this standard provides principles for allocation of consideration among its multiple elements  allowing more flexibility in identifying and accounting for separate deliverables under an arrangement 
asu no 
introduces an estimated selling price method for valuing the elements of a bundled arrangement if vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of selling price is not available  and significantly expands related disclosure requirements 
this standard is effective on a prospective basis for revenue 
table of contents arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  alternatively  adoption may be on a retrospective basis  and early application is permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures 
in april  the fasb issued asu  revenue recognition milestone method topic milestone method of revenue recognition asu 
asu provides guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research or development transactions 
consideration that is contingent on achievement of a milestone in its entirety may be recognized as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone is judged to meet certain criteria to be considered substantive 
milestones should be considered substantive in their entirety and may not be bifurcated 
an arrangement may contain both substantive and non substantive milestones  and each milestone should be evaluated individually to determine if it is substantive 
asu is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
we did not elect the early adoption option and because we currently do not have performance payment milestones in our contractual arrangements we do not expect that the adoption would have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the following discussion about market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we deposit our excess cash in high quality financial instruments  primarily money market funds and certificates of deposit and  we may be exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates 
we do not actively manage the risk of interest rate fluctuations on our marketable securities  however  such risk is mitigated by the relatively short term nature of these investments 
we do not expect the current rate of inflation to have a material impact on our business 
these investments are denominated in united states dollars 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations  while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve these objectives  our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short and long term investments in a variety of securities  which could include commercial paper  money market funds and corporate debt securities 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  and were invested in liquid money market accounts and certificates of deposit 
all market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk we conduct business outside the us in several currencies including the british pound sterling  euro  and indian rupee 
the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using period end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses 
we do not hold any derivative instruments and do not engage in any hedging activities 
although our reporting currency is the us dollar  we may conduct business and incur costs in the local currencies of other countries in which we may operate  make sales and buy materials 
as a result  we are subject to currency translation risk 
further  changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar could affect our future net sales and cost of sales and could result in exchange losses 
we cannot accurately predict future exchange rates or the overall impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future  our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase and hedging activities may be considered if appropriate
