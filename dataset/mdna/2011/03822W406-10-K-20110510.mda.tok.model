item  management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations  we remain active in the storage industry with our design and sale of embedded storage processor chips and gigabit connectivity solutions with our embedded process products 
we intend to continue working closely with leaders in the storage  networking and computing industries to design and develop new and enhanced storage connectivity products 
we believe that establishing strategic relationships with technology partners is essential to ensure that we continue to design and develop competitive products that integrate well with solutions from other leading participants in the storage markets 
research and development our research and development r d expertise and efforts are focused on the development of high performance analog  digital and mixed signal ics and on the development of highly integrated embedded processing soc ics for the communications market 
we also develop high performance libraries and design methodologies that are optimized for each of these applications 
our primary r d facilities are located in sunnyvale and san diego  california  austin  texas and andover  massachusetts in the united states  ottawa in canada  ho chi minh city in vietnam and pune in india 
during the fiscal years ended march   and  we expended million  million and million  respectively  on r d activities 
our ic product development is focused on building high performance  high complexity digital and analog intensive designs that are incorporated into well documented blocks that can be reused for multiple products 
we have made and will continue to make significant investments in advanced design tools to leverage the efforts of our engineering staff 
our product development is driven by the imperatives of reducing design cycle time  increasing first time design correctness  adhering to disciplined  well documented design processes and continuing to be responsive to customer needs 
we are also developing high performance final assembly packages for our products in collaboration with our packaging suppliers and our customers 
our printed circuit board assembly pcba development efforts are focused on building advanced telecom computing architecture atca evaluation boards and software for our switch fabric  network processors and embedded powerpc processors for the communications market 
before a new product is developed  our r d engineers work with marketing managers and customers to develop a comprehensive requirements specification 
after the product is designed and commercially released  our engineers continue to work with customers on early design in efforts to understand requirements for future generations and upgrades 
on november   we amended certain agreements with veloce technologies  inc veloce  initially entered into on may   pursuant to which veloce had agreed to perform product development work for us on an exclusive basis for up to five years for cash and other consideration  including a warrant to purchase our shares of common stock  which will vest in quarterly increments through december a portion of the vested shares have been committed to be distributed to the employees of veloce and will be settled in cash instead of common stock 
therefore  we have recognized stock based compensation expense in r d expense and recorded a corresponding liability for this distribution in our consolidated financial statements 
under the amended merger agreement  the company agreed to acquire veloce if certain performance milestones and delivery schedules set forth under the merger and other agreements are achieved 
we also have the unilateral option to acquire veloce in the event veloce fails to meet the milestones and delivery schedules 
should we acquire veloce pursuant to the merger agreement  the purchase price is estimated to be in the range of approximately million up to 
table of contents approximately million  subject to additional adjustments 
the final price would be based upon the achievement and timing of multiple development and performance milestones 
at this time the eventual outcome is not determinable and as such we are unable to provide a narrower range for the estimated merger consideration 
we will update the range in the future when additional relevant information is available 
the amended agreements permit us to appoint two individuals to serve on veloce s board of directors and board committees 
our chief executive officer and another member of the company s board of directors have been appointed to veloce s board of directors 
in addition  we provided veloce a promissory note of million to be forgiven over eight quarters starting on march  if veloce commits a material breach of the merger agreement  the outstanding principal amount of the note and accrued interest becomes due 
if we commit a material breach of the merger agreement  the outstanding principal amount of the note and accrued interest is to be forgiven 
in april  we agreed to loan million to veloce 
this loan will bear interest at a rate of and the accrued interest and principal amount will be repaid when we make a decision to either spin in or to sever our relationship with veloce 
re payment can be in cash or as an adjustment against the eventual merger consideration should a merger occur 
pursuant to the product development agreement  as amended  we will pay veloce million per quarter for up to twelve consecutive quarters in order to assist veloce in meeting its expenses to perform its obligations under the agreement 
this amount has increased in the past due to agreed upon workscope changes and may change again in the future due to additional workscope changes 
we also paid  and will likely do so again  certain product development and manufacturing expenses incurred by veloce 
through march   no milestones have been met 
for a more detailed discussion  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item  exhibits  financial statement schedules  of this annual report 
the company does not hold any direct equity interest in veloce 
in september  we completed the acquisition of tpack  a denmark based company which specializes in the development and sale of otn chips that are based on field programmable gate arrays fpgas 
this approach to the packaging of otn functionality represents a new and innovative approach 
it enables much earlier delivery of emerging standards with the flexibility of modifying and refining these functions 
customers use these softsilicon devices for both prototyping and production 
we base them on the products of both xilinx and altera  reducing the risk of supply constraints and leveraging competitive forces for lower costs and improved fpga bases 
we have evolved the combination of softsilicon and our application specific standard products assps into more complete solutions that comprise many of the features required on our customers line cards 
over time  we will integrate softsilicon based products into more advanced assps  with the benefit of functions that have already been proven and accepted by our customers 
manufacturing manufacturing of integrated circuits the manufacturing of ics requires a combination of competencies in advanced silicon technologies  package design and manufacturing and high speed test and characterization 
we have obtained access to advanced complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos through foundry relationships 
we have substantial experience in the development and use of plastic and ceramic packages for high performance applications 
the selection of the optimal package solution is a vital element of the delivery of high performance products and involves balancing cost  size  thermal management and technical performance 
we purchase our ceramic and plastic packages from several vendors including advanced semiconductor engineering ase  amkor  siliconware precision industries co ltd 
spil  ibm  kyocera  and ntk 
wafer fabrication we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our products are made 
we use external foundries such as ibm  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation tsmc and united microelectronics corporation umc for the majority of our production of silicon wafers 
subcontracting our manufacturing requirements eliminates the high fixed cost of owning and operating a semiconductor wafer fabrication facility and enables us to focus our resources on design of ics and applications where we believe we have greater core competencies and competitive advantages 

table of contents assembly and testing our wafer probe and other product testing are conducted at independent test subcontractors 
after wafer testing is complete  the majority of our products are sent to multiple subcontractors for assembly  predominately located in asia 
following assembly  the devices are tested at subcontractors and returned to us ready for shipment to our customers 
certain of these services are available from a limited number of sources and lead times are occasionally extended 
sales and marketing our sales and marketing strategy is to develop strong  engineering intensive relationships with the customer design teams for the creation of market leading platforms 
we maintain close working relationships with these customers so our marketing team can focus on identifying and developing new products that will meet their needs in the future  involving us in the early stages of our customers plans to design new equipment 
we sell our products both directly and through a network of independent manufacturers representatives and distributors 
our direct sales force is technically trained 
expert technical support is critical to our customers success and we provide such support through our field applications engineers  technical marketing team and engineering staff  as well as through our extranet technical support web site 
we augment this strategic account sales approach with domestic and foreign distributors that service some of our accounts purchasing standard ics 
typically  these distributors handle a wide variety of products  including those that compete with our products and fill orders for many customers 
we use marketing programs to augment the distribution effort to reach many of our customers 
most of our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for price protection and stock rotation of unsold merchandise 
our sales headquarters is located in sunnyvale  california 
we maintain sales offices throughout the world 
net revenues generated from each category of our products as well as information regarding net revenue generated from each of our significant customers and a geographic breakdown of our net revenues is summarized in part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
backlog our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for the delivery of products 
quantities of our products to be delivered and delivery schedules are frequently revised to reflect changes in customers needs  customer orders generally can be cancelled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
for these reasons  our backlog as of any particular date is not representative of actual sales for any succeeding period and therefore  we believe that backlog is not necessarily a good indicator of future revenue trends 
competition in the transport communications ic markets  we compete primarily against companies such as broadcom  pmc sierra  cortina  netlogic and vitesse 
in the embedded processor communications ic market  we compete with technology companies such as freescale semiconductor  cavium and intel 
in addition  some of our customers and potential customers have internal ic designs or manufacturing capabilities with which we compete 
the communications ic market is highly competitive and is subject to rapid technological change 
the nature of the communications ic market is that design cycles are often measured in years 
as such  an ic supplier s timing of delivery to market is critical as once an ic supplier s product is designed into a customer s products  the ic supplier can often enjoy sales of the product for several years 
conversely  if a supplier misses a design cycle or develops an uncompetitive product  the supplier may never generate significant revenues from the product 
we typically face competition at the design stage when our customers are selecting which components to use in their next generation equipment 
we believe that the principal factors of competition for the markets we serve include product performance  quality  reliability  integration  price and time to market  as well 
table of contents as our reputation and level of customer support 
our ability to successfully compete in these markets depends on our ability to design and subcontract the manufacture of new products that implement new technologies and gain end market acceptance in a time efficient and cost effective manner 
proprietary rights we rely in part on patents to protect our intellectual property 
we have been issued approximately patents  which principally cover certain aspects of the design and architecture of our ic and enterprise storage products 
in addition  we have over inventions in various stages of the patenting process in the united states and abroad 
there can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications or any future applications will be approved  or that any issued patents will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties or that if challenged  will be found to be valid or enforceable  or that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business 
there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar products or processes  duplicate our products or processes or design around any patents that may be issued to us 
to protect our intellectual property  we also rely on a combination of mask work protection under the federal semiconductor chip protection act of  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements 
as a general matter  the semiconductor and enterprise storage industries are characterized by substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
in the past we have been  and in the future may be  notified that we may be infringing on the intellectual property rights of third parties 
we have certain indemnification obligations to customers with respect to the infringement of third party intellectual property rights by our products 
there can be no assurance that infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by customers or end users of our products resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted in the future or that such assertions  if proven to be true  will not have a materially adverse affect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
in the event of any adverse ruling in any such matter  we could be required to pay substantial damages  which could include treble damages  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain a license under the intellectual property rights of the third party claiming infringement 
there can be no assurance that a license would be available on reasonable terms or at all 
any limitations on our ability to market our products  any delays and costs associated with redesigning our products or payments of license fees to third parties or any failure by us to develop or license a substitute technology on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
environmental matters we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals that were used in our manufacturing process 
any failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines  the suspension of production or a cessation of operations 
such regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment or incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations or clean up prior discharges 
since  we have been named as a potentially responsible party prp along with a large number of other companies that used omega chemical corporation in whittier  california to handle and dispose of certain hazardous waste material 
we are a member of a large group of prps that has agreed to fund certain remediation efforts at the omega chemical corporation site  which efforts are ongoing 
for more information see our risk factor titled we could incur substantial fines or litigation costs associated with our storage  use and disposal of hazardous materials in part i  item a  risk factors  below and refer to footnote legal proceedings to the financial statements

risk factors 
risk factors before deciding to invest in us or to maintain or increase your investment  you should carefully consider the risks described below  in addition to the other information contained in this annual report and in our other filings with the sec 
we update our descriptions of the risks and uncertainties facing us in our periodic reports filed with the sec 
the risks and uncertainties described below and in our other filings are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business 
if any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed 
in that event  the market price for our common stock could decline and you may lose your investment 
if we are unable to timely develop new products or new generations and versions of our existing products to replace our current products  our operating results and competitive position will be materially harmed 
our industry is characterized by intense competition  rapidly evolving technology and continually changing customer requirements 
these factors could render our existing products obsolete 
accordingly  our ability to compete in the future will depend in large part on our ability to identify and develop new products or new generations and versions of our existing products that achieve market acceptance on a timely and cost effective basis  and to respond to changing requirements 
if we are unable to do so  our business  operating results and financial condition will be negatively affected 
the successful development and market acceptance of our products depend on a number of factors  including  but not limited to our accurate prediction of changing customer requirements  timely development of new designs  timely qualification and certification of our products for use in electronic systems  commercial acceptance and production of the electronic systems into which our products are incorporated  availability  quality  price  performance  and size of our products relative to competing products and technologies  our customer service and support capabilities and responsiveness  successful development of relationships with existing and potential new customers  successful development of relationships with key developers of advanced digital semiconductors  changes in technology and industry standards  and rapidly changing consumer preferences 
in addition  on november   we amended certain agreements with veloce  initially entered into on may   pursuant to which veloce agreed to perform product development work for us on an exclusive basis for up to five years for cash and other consideration  including a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock  which will vest quarterly through december a portion of the vested shares have been committed to be distributed to the employees of veloce and will be settled in cash instead of common stock 
therefore  we have recognized stock based compensation expense in r d expense and recorded a corresponding liability for this distribution in our consolidated financial statements 
under the merger agreement with veloce  as amended  we agreed to acquire veloce if certain performance milestones and delivery schedules set forth under the merger and other agreements are achieved 
we also have the unilateral option to acquire veloce in the event veloce fails 
table of contents to meet the milestones and delivery schedules 
should we acquire veloce pursuant to the merger agreement  the purchase price is estimated to be in the range of approximately million up to approximately million  subject to adjustments 
at this time the eventual outcome is not determinable and as such we are unable to provide a narrower range for the estimated merger consideration 
we will update the range in the future when additional relevant information is available 
we also provided veloce a promissory note of million to be forgiven over eight quarters starting on march  in april  we agreed to loan million to veloce 
this loan will bear interest at a rate of and the accrued interest and principal amount will be repaid when we make a decision to either spin in or to sever our relationship with veloce 
re payment can be in cash or as an adjustment against the eventual merger consideration should a merger occur 
we will also pay veloce million per quarter for up to twelve consecutive quarters in order to assist veloce in meeting its expenses to perform its obligations under the agreement 
this amount has increased in the past due to agreed upon workscope changes and may change again in the future due to additional workscope changes 
we also paid  and will likely do so again  certain product development and manufacturing expenses incurred by veloce 
our arrangement with veloce may not result in the development of any new technologies or products 
moreover  products we have recently developed and which we are currently developing may not achieve market acceptance 
if these products fail to achieve market acceptance  or if we fail to timely develop new products that achieve market acceptance  our business  financial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely affected 
our dependence on third party manufacturing and supply relationships increases the risk that we will not have an adequate supply of products to meet demand or that our cost of materials will be higher than expected 
we depend upon third parties to manufacture  assemble  package or test certain of our products 
as a result  we are subject to risks associated with these third parties  including reduced control over delivery schedules and quality  inadequate manufacturing yields and excessive costs  ability to attract and retain key personnel and to maintain knowledge base  difficulties selecting and integrating new subcontractors  potential lack of adequate capacity at the foundry during periods of excess demand  resulting in significant increases in lead time requirements and production delays  increased risk of excess and obsolete inventory charges due to the higher level of inventories in response to the increased lead times  limited warranties on products supplied to us  potential increases in prices  potential instability in countries where third party manufacturers are located  and potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 
our outside foundries generally manufacture our products on a purchase order basis  and we have few long term supply arrangements with these suppliers 
we have less control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs than competitors with their own fabrication facilities 
a manufacturing disruption or capacity constraint experienced by one or more of our outside foundries or a disruption of our relationship with an outside foundry  including discontinuance of our products by that foundry  would negatively impact the production of certain of our products for a substantial period of time 
as our third party manufacturing suppliers extend their lead time requirements  we will likely need to also extend our lead time requirements to our customers 
this could cause our customers to lower their competitive assessment of us as a supplier and as a result  we may not be considered for future design awards 

table of contents our ic products are generally only qualified for production at a single foundry 
these suppliers can allocate  and in the past have allocated  capacity to the production of other companies products while reducing deliveries to us on short notice 
there is also the potential that they may discontinue manufacturing our products or go out of business 
because establishing relationships  designing or redesigning ics  and ramping production with new outside foundries may take over a year  there is no readily available alternative source of supply for these products 
difficulties associated with adapting our technology and product design to the proprietary process technology and design rules of outside foundries can lead to reduced yields of our ic products 
the process technology of an outside foundry is typically proprietary to the manufacturer 
since low yields may result from either design or process technology failures  yield problems may not be effectively determined or resolved until an actual product exists that can be analyzed and tested to identify process sensitivities relating to the design rules that are used 
as a result  yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process  and resolution of yield problems may require cooperation between us and our manufacturer 
this risk could be compounded by the offshore location of certain of our manufacturers  increasing the effort and time required to identify  communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems 
manufacturing defects that we do not discover during the manufacturing or testing process may lead to costly product recalls 
these risks may lead to increased costs or delayed product delivery  which would harm our profitability and customer relationships 
if the foundries or subcontractors we use to manufacture our products discontinue the manufacturing processes needed to meet our demands  or fail to upgrade their technologies needed to manufacture our products  we may be unable to deliver products to our customers  which could materially adversely affect our operating results and harm our reputation 
the transition to the next generation of manufacturing technologies at one or more of our outside foundries could be unsuccessful or delayed 
our requirements typically represent a very small portion of the total production of the third party foundries 
as a result  we are subject to the risk that a producer will cease production of an older or lower volume process that it uses to produce our parts 
we cannot assure you that our external foundries will continue to devote resources to the production of parts for our products or continue to advance the process design technologies on which the manufacturing of our products are based 
each of these events could increase our costs  lower our gross margin  cause us to hold more inventories or materially impact our ability to deliver our products on time 
as our volumes decrease with any third party foundry  the likelihood of unfavorable pricing increases 
some companies that supply our customers are similarly dependent on a limited number of suppliers to produce their products 
these other companies products may be designed into the same networking equipment into which our products are designed 
our order levels could be reduced materially if these companies are unable to access sufficient production capacity to produce in volumes demanded by our customers because our customers may be forced to slow down or halt production on the equipment into which our products are designed 
natural disasters in certain regions  such as japan  could adversely affect our manufacturing and supply chain which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our business  our results of operations and our financial condition 
the occurrence of natural disasters in certain regions  such as the recent earthquake and tsunami in japan  could negatively impact our manufacturing and supply chain  our ability to deliver products  on a timely basis or at all  to our customers  the cost of our products  and the demand for our products 
the occurrence of natural disasters could also cause delays in our customers supply chain  causing them to delay their requirements for our products until they resolve shortages from their other suppliers 
any such occurrences of natural disasters could have a material adverse effect on our business  our results of operations and our financial condition 

table of contents we may experience difficulties in transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies or in achieving higher levels of design integration and  as a result  may experience reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
as smaller line width geometry processes become more prevalent  we expect to integrate greater levels of functionality into our ic products and to transition our ic products to increasingly smaller geometries 
this transition will require us to redesign certain products and will require us and our foundries to migrate to new manufacturing processes for our products 
we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis 
we periodically evaluate the benefits  on a product by product basis  of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies to reduce our costs and increase performance  and we have designed ic products to be manufactured at as little as 
micron geometry processes 
we have experienced some difficulties in shifting to smaller geometry process technologies and new manufacturing processes 
these difficulties resulted in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
the transition to smaller geometries is inherently more expensive and as we manufacture more products using smaller geometries  the incremental costs could have an adverse impact on our earnings 
we may face similar difficulties  delays and expenses as we continue to transition our ic products to smaller geometry processes 
we are dependent on our relationships with our foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully 
we cannot assure you that our foundries will be able to effectively manage the transition or that we will be able to maintain our relationships with our foundries 
if we or our foundries experience significant delays in this transition or fail to implement this transition  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the gross margins for our products could decrease rapidly or not increase as forecasted  which will negatively impact our business  financial conditions and results of operations 
the gross margins for our solutions have historically declined over time 
factors that we expect to cause downward pressure on the gross margins for our products include competitive pricing pressures  the cost sensitivity of our customers  particularly in the higher volume markets  new product introductions by us or our competitors  and other factors 
from time to time  for strategic reasons  we may accept orders at less than optimal gross margins in order to facilitate the introduction of  or  market penetration of our new or existing products 
to maintain acceptable operating results  we will need to offset any reduction in gross margins of our products by reducing costs  increasing sales volume  developing and introducing new products and developing new generations and versions of existing products on a timely basis 
if the gross margins for our products decline or not increase as anticipated and we are unable to offset those reductions  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
the current economic circumstances and uncertain political conditions could harm our revenues  operating results and financial condition 
the economies of the united states and other developed or developing countries appear to be currently coming out of a recession 
we cannot predict either if this economic recovery will continue or reverse course 
the recent recession has caused a decline in our near term revenues and it will take some time for our near term revenues to return to our previous levels 
our current operating plans are based on assumptions concerning levels of consumer and corporate spending 
if global and domestic economic and market conditions persist or deteriorate  we may experience further material impacts on our business  operating results and financial condition which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 
if economic conditions worsen  we may have to implement additional cost reduction measures or delay certain r d spending  which may adversely impact our ability to introduce new products and technologies 

table of contents we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types of instruments and maturities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
our portfolio primarily includes fixed income securities  mutual funds and preferred stock  the values of which are subject to market price volatility 
the deterioration of these market prices has had an unfavorable impact on our portfolio and has caused us to record impairment charges to our earnings 
during the fiscal years ended march  and  we recorded other than temporary impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
if market prices continue to decline or securities continue to be in a loss position over time  we may recognize additional impairments in the fair value of our investments 
adverse economic and market conditions could also harm our business by negatively affecting the parties with whom we do business  including our business partners  our customers and our suppliers 
these conditions could impair the ability of our customers to pay for products they have purchased from us 
as a result  allowances for doubtful accounts and write offs of accounts receivable from our customers may increase 
in addition  our suppliers may experience financial difficulties that could negatively affect their operations and their ability to supply us with the parts we need to manufacture our products 
we have invested in privately held companies  many of which can still be considered in startup or developmental stages 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
we could lose all or substantially all of the value of our investments in these companies and  in some cases  we have lost all or substantially all of the value of our investment in such entities 
our operating results may fluctuate because of a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
if our operating results are below the expectations of research analysts or investors  then the market price of our common stock could decline 
some of the factors that affect our quarterly and annual results  but which are difficult to control or predict  are communications  information technology and semiconductor industry conditions  fluctuations in the timing and amount of customer requests for product shipments  the reduction  rescheduling or cancellation of orders by customers  including as a result of slowing demand for our products or our customers products or over ordering or double booking of our products or our customers products  changes in the mix of products that our customers buy  the gain or loss of one or more key customers or their key customers  or significant changes in the financial condition of one or more of our key customers or their key customers  our ability to introduce  certify and deliver new products and technologies on a timely basis  the announcement or introduction of new products and technologies by our competitors  competitive pressures on selling prices  the ability of our customers to obtain components from their other suppliers  market acceptance of our products and our customers products  fluctuations in manufacturing output  yields or other problems or delays in the fabrication  assembly  testing or delivery of our products or our customers products  disasters that could effect our supply chain or our customers supply chain  increases in the costs of products or discontinuance of products by our suppliers  the availability of external foundry capacity  contract manufacturing services  purchased parts and raw materials including packaging substrates  
table of contents the availability of package and test vendor capacity  problems or delays that we and our foundries may face in shifting the design and manufacture of our future generations of ic products to smaller geometry process technologies and in achieving higher levels of design and device integration  the timing of meeting the specifications and expense recovery on non recurring engineering projects  the amounts and timing of costs associated with warranties and product returns  the amounts and timing of investments in r d  the product lifecycle and recoverability of capitalized architectural licenses  technology access fees and mask sets  the amounts and timing of the costs associated with payroll taxes related to stock option exercises or settlement of restricted stock units  costs associated with acquisitions and the integration of acquired companies  products and technologies  the impact of potential one time charges related to purchased intangibles  our ability to successfully integrate acquired companies  products and technologies  the impact on interest income of a significant use of our cash for an acquisition  stock repurchase or other purpose  the effects of changes in interest rates or credit worthiness on the value and yield of our short term investment portfolio  costs associated with compliance with applicable environmental  other governmental or industry regulations including costs to redesign products to comply with those regulations or lost revenue due to failure to comply in a timely manner  the effects of changes in accounting standards  costs associated with litigation  including without limitation  attorney fees  litigation judgments or settlements  relating to the use or ownership of intellectual property or other claims arising out of our operations  our ability to identify  hire and retain senior management and other key personnel  the effects of war  acts of terrorism or global threats  such as disruptions in general economic activity and changes in logistics and security arrangements  and global economic and industry conditions 
our business  financial condition and operating results would be harmed if we do not achieve anticipated revenues 
we can have revenue shortfalls for a variety of reasons  including shortages of raw materials or production capacity constraints that lead our suppliers to allocate available supplies or capacity to their other customers  which may disrupt our ability to meet our production obligations  our customers may experience shortages from their suppliers that may cause them to delay orders or deliveries of our products  delays in the availability of our products or our customers products  the reduction  rescheduling or cancellation of customer orders  declines in the average selling prices of our products  
table of contents delays when our customers are transitioning from old products to new products  a decrease in demand for our products or our customers products  a decline in the financial condition or liquidity of our customers or their customers  the failure of our products to be qualified in our customers systems or certified by our customers  excess inventory of our products held by our customers  resulting in a reduction in their order patterns as they work through the excess inventory of our products  fabrication  test  product yield  or assembly constraints for our products that adversely affect our ability to meet our production obligations  the failure of one or more of our subcontract manufacturers to perform its obligations to us  our failure to successfully integrate acquired companies  products and technologies  and global economic and industry conditions 
our business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules 
customer orders typically can be cancelled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
because we do not have substantial non cancellable backlog  we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
customer orders for our products typically have non standard lead times  which make it difficult for us to predict revenues and plan inventory levels and production schedules 
if we are unable to plan inventory levels and production schedules effectively  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
from time to time  in response to anticipated long lead times to obtain inventory and materials from our outside contract manufacturers  suppliers and foundries  we may order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand 
this advance ordering has in the past and may in the future result in excess inventory levels or unanticipated inventory write downs if expected orders fail to materialize  or other factors render our products less marketable 
if we are forced to hold excess inventory or we incur unanticipated inventory write downs  our financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
our expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term and are based on our expectations of future revenues 
we have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
changes to production volumes and impact of overhead absorption may result in a decline in our financial condition or liquidity 
our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the technology sector and the internet 
the technology equipment industry is cyclical and has in the past experienced significant and extended downturns 
the recent downturn was significant and we cannot predict if the current improvement is sustainable in the near future 
a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on the continued growth of the technology sector and the internet 
we sell our communications ic products primarily to communications equipment manufacturers that in turn sell their equipment to customers that depend on the growth of the internet 
the past downturn has caused a reduction in capital spending on information technology 
while we are beginning to see indications of improvement  there are no guarantees that this growth will sustain  resulting in potential volatility 
if there is another downturn  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents the loss of one or more key customers  the diminished demand for our products from a key customer  or the failure to obtain certifications from a key customer or its distribution channel could significantly reduce our revenues and profits 
a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues in any particular period 
we have no long term volume purchase commitments from our key customers 
one or more of our key customers may discontinue operations as a result of consolidation  bankruptcy or otherwise 
reductions  delays and cancellation of orders from our key customers or the loss of one or more key customers could significantly reduce our revenues and profits 
we cannot assure you that our current customers will continue to place orders with us  that orders by existing customers will continue at current or historical levels or that we will be able to obtain orders from new customers 
our ability to maintain or increase sales to key customers and attract significant new customers is subject to a variety of factors  including supply constraints and manufacturing delays by our outside foundries may result in significantly reduced volumes and delayed deliveries of our products  customers may stop incorporating our products into their own products with limited notice to us and may suffer little or no penalty as a result of such action  customers or prospective customers may not incorporate our products into their future product designs  design wins as explained below with customers or prospective customers may not result in sales to such customers  the introduction of new products by customers may occur later or be less successful in the market than planned  we may successfully design a product to customer specifications but the customer may not be successful in the market  sales of customer product lines incorporating our products may rapidly decline or such product lines may be phased out  our agreements with customers typically are non exclusive and do not require them to purchase a minimum quantity of our products  many of our customers have pre existing relationships with our current or potential competitors that may cause our customers to switch from using our products to using competing products  some of our oem customers may develop products internally that would replace our products  we may not be able to successfully develop relationships with additional network equipment vendors  our relationships with some of our larger customers may deter other potential customers who compete with these customers from buying our products  the impact of terminating certain sales representatives or sales personnel as a result of a company workforce reduction or otherwise  and some of our customers and prospective customers may become less viable or fail 
the occurrence of any one of the factors above could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there is no guarantee that design wins will become actual orders and sales 
a design win occurs when a customer or prospective customer notifies us that our product has been selected to be integrated with the customer s product 
there can be delays of several months or more between the design win and when a customer initiates actual orders of our product 
following a design win  we will commit 
table of contents significant resources to the integration of our product into the customer s product before receiving the initial order 
receipt of an initial order from a customer following a design win  however  is dependent on a number of factors  including the success of the customer s product  and cannot be guaranteed 
the design win may never result in an actual order or sale 
any significant order cancellations or order deferrals could cause unplanned inventory growth resulting in excess inventory  which may adversely affect our operating results 
our customers may increase orders during periods of product shortages or cancel orders if their inventories are too high 
major inventory corrections by our customers are not uncommon and can last for significant periods of time and affect demand for our products 
customers may also cancel or delay orders in anticipation of new products or for other reasons 
cancellations or deferrals could cause us to hold excess inventory  which could reduce our profit margins by reducing sales prices  incurring inventory write downs or writing off additional obsolete products 
the book to bill ratio is commonly used by investors to compare and evaluate technology and semiconductor companies 
the book to bill ratio is a demand to supply ratio that compares the total amount of orders received to the total amount of orders filled 
this ratio tells whether the company has more orders than it delivered if greater than  has the same amount of orders that it delivered equals  or has less orders than it delivered under 
though the ratio provides an indicator of whether orders are rising or falling  it does not consider the timing of  or if the order will result in future revenues 
our book to bill ratio at march   and was  and  respectively 
the increasing lead times from our suppliers cause us to make commitments for inventory purchases earlier in our production cycle which in turn increases our risk of having excess inventory 
in addition  some of our suppliers are delivering based on allocations which in turn causes us to increase our inventory levels 
we must balance our inventory levels between the risk of losing a significant customer to a competitor because we cannot meet our customer s requirements and the risk of having excess inventory if a significant order is cancelled 
inventory fluctuations could affect our results of operations and restrict our ability to fund our operations 
inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times  meet customer expectations and guard against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements 
we generally recognize revenue upon shipment of products to a customer 
if a customer refuses to accept shipped products or does not pay for these products  we could miss future revenue projections or incur significant charges against our income  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
our customers products typically have lengthy design cycles 
a customer may decide to cancel or change its product plans  which could cause us to lose anticipated sales 
after we have developed and delivered a product to a customer  the customer will usually test and evaluate our product prior to designing its own equipment to incorporate our product 
our customers may need more than six months to test  evaluate and adopt our product and an additional nine months or more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates our product 
due to this lengthy design cycle  we may experience significant delays from the time we increase our operating expenses and make investments in inventory until the time that we generate revenue from these products 
it is possible that we may never generate any revenue from these products after incurring such expenditures 
even if a customer selects our product to incorporate into its equipment  we cannot guarantee that the customer will ultimately market and sell its equipment or that such efforts by our customer will be successful 
the delays inherent in this lengthy design cycle increases the risk that a customer will decide to cancel or change its product plans 
such a cancellation or change in plans by a customer could cause us to lose sales that we had anticipated 
while our customers design cycles are typically 
table of contents long  some of our product life cycles tend to be short as a result of the rapidly changing technology environment in which we operate 
as a result  the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not generate material revenue for us  and from time to time  we may need to write off excess and obsolete inventory 
if we incur significant marketing expenses and investments in inventory in the future that we are not able to recover  and we are not able to mitigate those expenses  our operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  if we sell our products at reduced prices in anticipation of cost reductions but still hold higher cost products in inventory  our operating results would be harmed 
an important part of our strategy is to focus on the markets for communications equipment 
if we change strategy or are unable to further expand our share of these markets or react timely or properly to emerging trends  our revenues may not grow and could decline 
our markets frequently undergo transitions in which products rapidly incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry wide basis 
if our products are unable to support the new features or performance levels required by oems in these markets  or if our products fail to be certified by oems  we will lose business from an existing or potential customer and may not have the opportunity to compete for new design wins or certification until the next product transition occurs 
if we fail to develop products with required features or performance standards  or if we experience a delay as short as a few months in certifying or bringing a new product to market  or if our customers fail to achieve market acceptance of their products  our revenues could be significantly reduced for a substantial period 
we expect a significant portion of our revenues to continue to be derived from sales of products based on current  widely accepted transmission standards 
if the communications market evolves to new standards  we may not be able to successfully design and manufacture new products that address the needs of our customers or gain substantial market acceptance 
the sale of our ware storage adapter business to lsi corporation marked a change in our strategy 
this change  or any further changes we might make  could have a significant impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations while we are implementing our new strategy 
if we do not identify and pursue the correct emerging trends and align ourselves with the correct market leaders  we may not be successful and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
customers for our products generally have substantial technological capabilities and financial resources 
some customers have traditionally used these resources to internally develop their own products 
the future prospects for our products in these markets are dependent upon our customers acceptance of our products as an alternative to their internally developed products 
future prospects also are dependent upon acceptance of third party sourcing for products as an alternative to in house development 
network equipment vendors may in the future continue to use internally developed components 
they also may decide to develop or acquire components  technologies or products that are similar to  or that may be substituted for  our products 
if our network equipment vendor customers fail to accept our products as an alternative  if they develop or acquire the technology to develop such components internally rather than purchase our products  or if we are otherwise unable to develop or maintain strong relationships with them  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents our business strategy contemplates the acquisition of other companies  products and technologies 
merger and acquisition activities involve numerous risks and we may not be able to address these risks successfully without substantial expense  delay or other operational or financial problems that could disrupt our business and harm our results of operations and financial condition 
acquiring products  technologies or businesses from third parties or making additional investments in companies we have already have an interest in is part of our long term business strategy 
the risks involved with merger and acquisition activities include potential dilution to our stockholders  use of a significant portion of our cash reserves  diversion of management s attention from our core business  failure to integrate or potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the acquired organizations 
difficulty in completing an acquired company s in process research or development projects  amortization of acquired intangible assets and deferred compensation  customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired company s products or services  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  costs associated with acquisitions or mergers  difficulties associated with combining or integrating acquired companies  purchased operations  products or technologies  difficulties and risks associated with entering and competing in markets that are unfamiliar to us  ability of the acquired companies to meet their financial projections  and assumption of unknown liabilities  or other unanticipated costs  events or circumstances 
in addition  in the event of any such investments or acquisitions  we could issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership  incur debt  assume liabilities  incur amortization or impairment expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  or incur large and immediate write offs 
any of these risks could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as with past acquisitions  future acquisitions could adversely affect operating results 
in particular  acquisitions may materially and adversely affect our results of operations because they may require large one time charges or could result in increased debt or contingent liabilities  adverse tax consequences  substantial additional depreciation or deferred compensation charges 
our past purchase acquisitions required us to capitalize significant amounts of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
as a result of the slowdown in our industry and reduction of our market capitalization  we have been required to record significant impairment charges against these assets as noted in our financial statements that are included in this annual report 
in the fiscal year ended march  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million to continuing operations 
the goodwill impaired was previously assigned to the process and transport reporting units in the amounts of million  million  respectively 
in the fiscal years ended march  and  we recorded goodwill impairment charges to discontinued operations of million and million  respectively  for the store reporting unit 
these market conditions continuously change and it is difficult to project how long these current uncertain economic conditions may last 
these conditions have caused a decline 
table of contents in our near term revenues and it will take some time to ramp back up to our previous levels 
additionally  market values had deteriorated  which had an unfavorable impact on our valuations which are part of the goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment tests 
there can be no assurances that market conditions will not deteriorate further or that our market capitalization will not decline further 
at march   we had million of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
we cannot assure you that we will not be required to take significant charges as a result of impairment to the carrying value of the purchased intangible assets  due to further adverse changes in market conditions 
on september   we completed the acquisition of tpack for million in cash  exclusive of million cash acquired  and potentially up to an additional million if certain performance milestones are achieved during an month period following the closing of the acquisition 
in conjunction with the acquisition  we recorded million in amortizable intangible assets and million in goodwill 
in january  tpack s supplier of fpgas announced they acquired a competitor of tpack 
this supplier will continue to provide fpgas for tpack s current products and products currently under development  but not for any future products 
while we were negotiating with another supplier of fpgas  they too also acquired a competitor of tpack in march the increased competition from the synergistic acquisitions could adversely affect the future revenue streams as we implement a library strategy where customers can choose either fpga supplier 
we recently finalized the purchase price allocation for the tpack acquisition 
the financial forecasts and other assumptions used to evaluate the acquisition that is included as part of the overall reporting unit may not materialize as expected 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate tpack s business  products  technologies or personnel or any additional businesses  products  technologies or personnel that we might acquire 
our industry and markets are subject to consolidation  which may result in stronger competitors  fewer customers and reduced demand 
there has been industry consolidation among communications ic companies  network equipment companies and telecommunications companies in the past 
we expect this consolidation to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their positions in evolving markets 
consolidation may result in stronger competitors  fewer customers and reduced demand  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
our operating results are subject to fluctuations because we rely heavily on international sales 
international sales account for a significant part of our revenues and may account for an increasing portion of our future revenues 
the revenues we derive from international sales may be subject to certain risks  including foreign currency exchange fluctuations  changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs  rising protectionism and other barriers  timing and availability of export licenses  political and economic instability  natural disasters  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  difficulties in managing distributors  difficulties in obtaining governmental and export approvals for communications  processors and other products  
table of contents reduced or uncertain protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable in some countries  burdens of complying with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties  potentially adverse tax consequences  and an uncertain economic condition that may trail any improvements in the united states 
we are subject to risks associated with the imposition of legislation and regulations relating to the import or export of high technology products 
we cannot predict whether quotas  duties  taxes or other charges or restrictions upon the importation or exportation of our products will be implemented by the united states or other countries 
because sales of our products have been denominated to date primarily in united states dollars  increases in the value of the united states dollar could increase the price of our products so that they become relatively more expensive to customers in the local currency of a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales and profitability in that country 
future international activity may result in increased foreign currency denominated sales 
gains and losses on the conversion to united states dollars of accounts payable and other monetary assets and liabilities arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations 
some of our customer purchase orders and agreements are governed by foreign laws  which may differ significantly from laws in the united states 
as a result  our ability to enforce our rights under such agreements may be limited compared with our ability to enforce our rights under agreements governed by laws in the united states 
our portfolio of short term investments are exposed to certain market risks 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types of instruments and maturities 
these securities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
our investment portfolio is exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and credit ratings of the issuers  as well as to the risks of default by the issuers and lack of overall market liquidity 
substantially all of these securities are subject to interest rate and credit rating risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase or one of the issuers credit ratings is reduced 
increases in interest rates or decreases in the credit worthiness of one or more of the issuers in our investment portfolio could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
during the fiscal years ended march  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  in write downs in the carrying value of certain securities as we determined the decline in the fair value of these securities to be other than temporary 
if there is a further deterioration in market conditions or there are additional losses incurred  we may be required to record a further decline in the carrying value of these securities resulting in further charges 
at march   the unrealized losses on these securities that were not written down as an other than temporary impairment charge were approximately million 
if the fair value of any of these securities does not recover to at least the amortized cost of such security or we are unable to hold these securities until they recover  we may be required to record a decline in the carrying value of these securities 
our restructuring activities could result in management distractions  operational disruptions and other difficulties 
over the past several years  we have initiated several restructuring activities in an effort to reduce operating costs  including new restructuring initiatives announced in october  february and january employees whose positions were eliminated in connection with these restructuring activities may seek employment with our customers or competitors 
although each of our employees is required to sign a confidentiality agreement with us at the time of hire  we cannot guarantee that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 
any additional restructuring 
table of contents efforts could divert the attention of our management away from our operations  harm our reputation and increase our expenses 
we cannot guarantee that we will not undertake additional restructuring activities  that any of our restructuring efforts will be successful  or that we will be able to realize the cost savings and other anticipated benefits from our previous or future restructuring plans 
in addition  if we continue to reduce our workforce  it may adversely impact our ability to respond rapidly to new growth opportunities 
our markets are subject to rapid technological change  so our success depends heavily on our ability to develop and introduce new products 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving and competing industry standards  changing customer needs  frequent introductions of new products and enhancements  increased integration with other functions  long design and sales cycles  short product life cycles  and intense competition 
to develop new products for the communications or other technology markets  we must develop  gain access to and use leading technologies in a cost effective and timely manner and continue to develop technical and design expertise 
we must have our products designed into our customers future products and maintain close working relationships with key customers in order to develop new products that meet customers changing needs 
we must respond to changing industry standards  trends towards increased integration and other technological changes on a timely and cost effective basis 
our pursuit of technological advances may require substantial time and expense and may ultimately prove unsuccessful 
if we are not successful in adopting such advances  we may be unable to timely bring to market new products and our revenues will suffer 
many of our products are based on industry standards that are continually evolving 
our ability to compete in the future will depend on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with these evolving industry standards 
the emergence of new industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major systems manufacturers 
as a result  we could be required to invest significant time and effort and to incur significant expense to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards 
if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards or requirements  we could miss opportunities to achieve crucial design wins which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the markets in which we compete are highly competitive  and we expect competition to increase in these markets in the future 
the markets in which we compete are highly competitive  and we expect that domestic and international competition will increase in these markets  due in part to deregulation  rapid technological advances  price erosion  changing customer preferences and evolving industry standards 
increased competition could result in significant price competition  reduced revenues  lower profit margins or loss of market share 
our ability to compete successfully in our markets depends on a number of factors  including our ability to partner with oem and channel partners who are successful in the market  success in designing and subcontracting the manufacture of new products that implement new technologies  
table of contents product quality  interoperability  reliability  performance and certification  customer support  time to market  price  production efficiency  design wins  expansion of production of our products for particular systems manufacturers  end user acceptance of the systems manufacturers products  market acceptance of competitors products  and general economic conditions 
our competitors may offer enhancements to existing products  or offer new products based on new technologies  industry standards or customer requirements that are available to customers on a more timely basis than comparable products from us or that have the potential to replace or provide lower cost alternatives to our products 
the introduction of enhancements or new products by our competitors could render our existing and future products obsolete or unmarketable 
we expect that certain of our competitors and other semiconductor companies may seek to develop and introduce products that integrate the functions performed by our ic products on a single chip  thus eliminating the need for our products 
each of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the transport communications ic markets  we compete primarily against companies such as broadcom  cortina  netlogic  pmc sierra and vitesse 
in the embedded processor communications ic market  we compete with technology companies such as freescale semiconductor  cavium and intel 
many of these companies may have substantially greater financial  marketing and distribution resources than we have 
certain of our customers or potential customers have internal ic design or manufacturing capabilities with which we compete 
we may also face competition from new entrants to our target markets  including larger technology companies that may develop or acquire differentiating technology and then apply their resources to our detriment 
any failure by us to compete successfully in these target markets would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results depend on manufacturing output and yields of our ics and printed circuit board assemblies  which may not meet expectations 
the yields on wafers we have manufactured decline whenever a substantial percentage of wafers must be rejected or a significant number of die on each wafer are nonfunctional 
such declines can be caused by many factors  including minute levels of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  design issues  defects in masks used to print circuits on a wafer and difficulties in the fabrication process 
design iterations and process changes by our suppliers can cause a risk of defects 
many of these problems are difficult to diagnose  are time consuming and expensive to remedy and can result in shipment delays 
we estimate yields per wafer and final packaged parts in order to estimate the value of inventory 
if yields are materially different than projected  work in process inventory may need to be re valued 
we may have to take inventory write downs as a result of decreases in manufacturing yields 
we may suffer periodic yield problems in connection with new or existing products or in connection with the commencement of production at a new manufacturing facility 
we must develop or otherwise gain access to improved ic process technologies 
our future success will depend upon our ability to access new ic process technologies 
in the future  we may be required to transition one or more of our ic products to process technologies with smaller geometries  
table of contents other materials or higher speeds in order to reduce costs or improve product performance 
we may not be able to gain access to new process technologies in a timely or affordable manner or products based on these new technologies may not achieve market acceptance 
the complexity of our products may lead to errors  defects and bugs  which could negatively impact our reputation with customers and result in liability 
products as complex as ours may contain errors  defects and bugs when first introduced or as new versions are released 
our products have in the past experienced such errors  defects and bugs 
delivery of products with production defects or reliability  quality or compatibility problems could significantly delay or hinder market acceptance of the products or result in a costly recall and could damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and to attract new customers 
errors  defects or bugs could cause problems with device functionality  resulting in interruptions  delays or cessation of sales to our customers 
we may also be required to make significant expenditures of capital and resources to resolve such problems 
we cannot assure you that problems will not be found in new products after commencement of commercial production  despite testing by us  our suppliers or our customers 
any problem could result in additional development costs  loss of  or delays in  market acceptance  diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts  claims by our customers or others against us  and loss of credibility with our current and prospective customers 
any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if our internal control over financial reporting is not considered effective  our business and stock price could be adversely affected 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year  and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report on form k for that fiscal year 
section also requires our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
our management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control system s objectives will be met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of control must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of internal control can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud involving a company have been  or will be  detected 
the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and we cannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
over time  our internal control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
our management has concluded  and our independent registered public accounting firm has attested  that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of march  we cannot assure you that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in our internal control 
table of contents over financial reporting in the future 
a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting would require management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report our internal control over financial reporting as ineffective 
if our internal control over financial reporting is not considered effective  we may experience a restatement like we have in the past of our financial statements and or a loss of public confidence  either of which could have an adverse effect on our business and on the market price of our common stock 
our future success depends in part on the continued service of our key senior management  design engineering  sales  marketing  and manufacturing personnel  our ability to identify  hire and retain additional  qualified personnel and successful succession planning 
our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our senior management personnel and successful succession planning 
the loss of key senior executives could have a material adverse effect on our business 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the semiconductor industry  in particular design  product and test engineers 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business  or to replace engineers or other qualified personnel who may leave our employment in the future 
we face the risks associated with our former employees assisting their new employers to recruit our key talent  in violation of their non solicitations covenants to us  as well as allegations by other companies that we have unlawfully solicited their employees to join us 
there may be significant costs associated with recruiting  hiring and retaining personnel 
periods of contraction in our business may inhibit our ability to attract and retain our personnel 
loss of the services of  or failure to recruit  key design engineers or other technical and management personnel could be significantly detrimental to our product development or other aspects of our business 
to manage operations effectively  we will be required to continue to improve our operational  financial and management systems and to successfully hire  train  motivate  and manage our employees 
the integration of future acquisitions would require significant additional management  technical and administrative resources 
we cannot guarantee that we would be able to manage our expanded operations effectively 
our ability to supply a sufficient number of products to meet demand could be severely hampered by a shortage of water  electricity or other supplies or by natural disasters or other catastrophes or by the effects of war  acts of terrorism or global threats 
the manufacture of our products requires significant amounts of water 
previous droughts have resulted in restrictions being placed on water use by manufacturers 
in the event of a future drought  reductions in water use may be mandated generally and our external foundries ability to manufacture our products could be impaired 
several of our facilities  including our principal executive offices  are located in california 
california has experienced prolonged energy alerts and blackouts caused by disruption in energy supplies 
as a consequence  businesses and other energy consumers in california continue to experience substantially increased costs of electricity and natural gas 
we are unsure whether energy alerts and blackouts will reoccur or how severe they may become in the future 
many of our customers and suppliers are also headquartered or have substantial operations in california 
if we or any of our major customers or suppliers located in california experience a sustained disruption in energy supplies  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
a significant portion of our manufacturing operations are located in asia 
these areas are subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes or floods  like japan 
we do not have earthquake insurance for these facilities  because adequate coverage is not offered at economically justifiable rates 
a significant natural disaster or other catastrophic event could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and operating results 
the effects of war  acts of terrorism or global threats  including  but not limited to  the outbreak of epidemic disease  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the 
table of contents continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat  or any future acts of terrorism  may cause further disruptions to local and global economies and create further uncertainties 
to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders  or the manufacture or shipment of our products  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we could incur substantial fines or litigation costs associated with our storage  use and disposal of hazardous materials 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process 
any failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines  the suspension of production or a cessation of operations 
these regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment or incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations or clean up prior discharges 
since  we have been named as a prp along with more than other companies that used omega chemical corporation waste treatment facility in whittier  california 
the us environmental protection agency epa has alleged that omega failed to properly treat and dispose of certain hazardous waste material 
we are a member of a large group of prps that has agreed to fund certain on going remediation efforts at the omega chemical corporation site 
based on currently available information  we have a loss accrual that is not material and we believe that the actual amount of costs will not be materially different from the amount accrued 
however  proceedings are ongoing and the eventual outcome of the clean up efforts and the pending litigation matters is uncertain at this time 
based on currently available information  we do not believe that any eventual outcome will have a material adverse effect on its operations but we cannot guarantee this result 
in  the prps were sued by a downstream chemical company  that action has been stayed since march to allow for further delineation of the regional groundwater 
in  the us supreme court decided us v 
burlington northern santa fe railway co  s 
ct 
 which determined that hazardous substance cleanup liability need not be joint and several in all cases 
as a result of this decision  the liability is potentially divisible among the prp at an earlier stage in superfund cases such as omega 
at this time we do not know and cannot predict the full impact of this decision on our liability  however  to protect against an unfavorable impact  we have joined the recently formed omega allocation committee in order to limit such exposure 
although we believe that we have been and currently are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  we cannot guarantee that we are or will be in material compliance with these laws or regulations or that our future obligations to fund any remediation efforts  including those at the omega chemical corporation site  will not have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
environmental laws and regulations could cause a disruption in our business and operations 
we are subject to various state  federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment  including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making manufacturers of those products financially responsible for the collection  treatment  recycling and disposal of certain products 
such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which we operate  including various european union eu member countries 
for example  the eu has enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment rohs and the waste electrical and electronic equipment weee directives 
rohs prohibits the use of lead and other substances in semiconductors and other products put on the market after july  the weee directive obligates parties that place electrical and electronic equipment on the market in the eu to put a clearly identifiable mark on the equipment  register with and report to eu member countries regarding distribution of the equipment  and provide a mechanism to take back and properly dispose of the equipment 
there can be no assurance that similar programs will not be implemented in other jurisdictions resulting in additional costs  possible delays in delivering products  and even the discontinuance of existing and planned future product replacements if the cost were to become prohibitive 

table of contents any dispositions we make could disrupt our business and harm our results of operations and financial condition 
we may dispose of assets or businesses that represent a significant portion of our business 
we completed the sale of our ware storage adapter business  a significant portion of our storage business  to lsi corporation on april  as a result  we now expect to generate all of our sales from our remaining business  which we would be required to grow in order to achieve profitability 
economic and other factors may prevent us from growing our remaining business 
if we fail to grow our remaining business  it could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and operating results 
future dispositions may involve numerous risks  including problems carving out or disposing of assets  operations  technologies and products  the disposal of such assets or businesses could have an unanticipated adverse effect on the remaining business  unanticipated costs  diversion of management s attention from core ongoing operations  potential adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  and if we do not structure the disposition properly and scale expenses according to the size of the remaining business  we could continue to incur expenses that could be unsustainable given the scope of the remaining business 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property adequately 
we rely in part on patents to protect our intellectual property 
we cannot assure you that our pending patent applications or any future applications will be approved  or that any issued patents will adequately protect the intellectual property in our products and processes  will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties  or that if challenged  any such patent will be found to be valid or enforceable 
others may independently develop similar products or processes  duplicate our products or processes or design around any patents that may be issued to us 
to protect our intellectual property  we also rely on the combination of mask work protection under the federal semiconductor chip protection act of  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements  and licensing arrangements 
despite these efforts  we cannot assure you that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property  or disclose such intellectual property or trade secrets  or that we can meaningfully protect our intellectual property 
a failure by us to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and strategic partners 
we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these efforts  parties may attempt to copy  disclose  obtain or use our products  services or technology without our authorization 
also  former employees may seek employment with our business partners  customers or competitors and we cannot assure you that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 
additionally  former employees or third parties could attempt to penetrate our network to misappropriate our proprietary information or interrupt our business 
because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques 
as a result  our technologies and processes may be misappropriated  particularly in foreign countries where laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 

table of contents we could be harmed by litigation involving patents  proprietary rights or other claims 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources  including the attention of our management and technical personnel  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be accused of infringing on the intellectual property rights of third parties 
we have certain indemnification obligations to customers with respect to the infringement of third party intellectual property rights by our products 
we cannot assure you that infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by customers or end users resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted in the future  or that such assertions will not harm our business 
any litigation relating to the intellectual property rights of third parties would at a minimum be costly and could divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel 
in the event of any adverse ruling in any such litigation  we could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacturing  use and sale of infringing products  discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain a license under the intellectual property rights of the third party claiming infringement 
a license might not be available on reasonable terms or at all 
from time to time  we may be involved in litigation relating to other claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business 
the ultimate outcome of any such litigation matters could have a material  adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
our stock price is volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly 
in the future  the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to general economic and market conditions and in response to quarter to quarter variations in our anticipated or actual operating results  announcements or introductions of new products by us or our competitors  anticipated or actual operating results of our customers  peers or competitors  technological innovations or setbacks by us or our competitors  conditions in the semiconductor  communications or information technology markets  the commencement or outcome of litigation or governmental investigations  changes in ratings and estimates of our performance by securities analysts  announcements of merger or acquisition transactions  management changes  our inclusion in certain stock indices  and other events or factors 
the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of many high technology companies  particularly semiconductor companies 
in some instances  these fluctuations appear to have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the affected companies 
whether or not our stock is part of one or more index funds could have a significant impact on our stock 
we cannot assure you that our stock will be part of any index fund 
in addition  the current decline of the financial markets and related factors beyond our control  including the credit and mortgage crisis in both the us and worldwide  may cause our stock price to decline rapidly and unexpectedly

the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be harmed by  the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock may delay  defer or prevent a change in control  as the terms of the preferred stock that might be issued could potentially prohibit our consummation of any merger  reorganization  sale of substantially all of our assets  liquidation or other extraordinary corporate transaction without the approval of the holders of the outstanding shares of preferred stock 
the issuance of preferred stock could have a dilutive effect on our stockholders 
if we issue additional shares of stock in the future  it may have a dilutive effect on our stockholders 
we have a significant number of authorized and unissued shares of our common stock available 
these shares will provide us with the flexibility to issue our common stock for proper corporate purposes  which may include making acquisitions through the use of stock  adopting additional equity incentive plans and raising equity capital

table of contents our business had three reporting units  process  transport and store 
on april   we completed the sale of our ware storage adapter business  which was substantially all of the business of our store reporting unit  to lsi corporation to focus on our process and transport reporting units 
we are a semiconductor company that possesses fundamental and differentiated intellectual property for high speed signal processing  packet based communications processors and telecommunications transport protocols 
this intellectual property enables us to be a key player in the datacenter  enterprise and telecommunications applications 
our customer focus is on the oems and telecommunications companies that build and connect to datacenters 
as of march   our business had two reporting units  process and transport 
on september   we completed the acquisition of tpack  a limited liability company organized under the laws of denmark  in accordance with the terms and conditions of the stock purchase agreement dated august  the revenues of tpack have been included in our transport reporting unit and were not material 
since the start of fiscal  we have invested a total of million in the r d of new products  including higher speed  lower power and lower cost products  products that combine the functions of multiple existing products into single highly integrated products  and other products to complete our portfolio of communications products 
these products  and our customers products for which they are intended  are highly complex 
due to this complexity  it often takes several years to complete the development and qualification of these products before they enter into volume production 
accordingly  we have not yet generated significant revenues from some of the products developed during this time period 
in addition  downturns in the telecommunications market can severely impact our customers business and usually results in significantly less demand for our products than was expected when the development work commenced

in july  we entered into a patent purchase agreement the agreement with qualcomm incorporated qualcomm 
pursuant to the agreement  we agreed to sell a series of our patents  patent applications and associated rights related to certain technologies for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the purchase price was paid over three years in equal quarterly payments of million each beginning in the three months ended december  through march  due to the nature of the payment terms  related revenue was recorded as the payments were received 
in november  we also entered into another patent purchase agreement with acacia patent acquisition llc apac 
pursuant to this agreement  we agreed to sell a series of our patents  patent applications and associated rights related to certain technologies for an aggregate purchase price of million payable over two years and a share of royalty payments for assignment of rights under the sale and or use of the patents 
due to the nature of the payment terms  related revenue is being recorded as the payments are received 
the occurrence of natural disasters in certain regions  such as the recent earthquake and tsunami in japan  could negatively impact our manufacturing and supply chain  our ability to deliver products  on a timely basis or at all  to our customers  the cost of our products  and the demand for our products 
the occurrence of natural disasters could also cause delays in our customers supply chain  causing them to delay their requirements for our products until they resolve shortages from their other suppliers 
any such occurrences of natural disasters could have a material adverse effect on our business  our results of operations and our financial condition 
the gross margins for our solutions have historically declined over time 
some factors that we expect to cause downward pressure on the gross margins for our products include competitive pricing pressures  the cost sensitivity of our customers  particularly in the higher volume markets  new product introductions by us or our competitors  and capacity constraints in our supply chain 
from time to time  for strategic reasons  we may 
table of contents accept orders at less than optimal gross margins in order to facilitate the introduction of  or  market penetration of our new or existing products 
to maintain acceptable operating results  we will need to offset any reduction in gross margins of our products by reducing costs  increasing sales volume  developing and introducing new products and developing new generations and versions of existing products on a timely basis 
the demand for our products has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following the timing  rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability  as well as the ability of our customers  to manage inventory corrections  the qualification  availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on the sales  pricing and gross margins of our products 
our ability to specify  develop or acquire  complete  introduce  and market new products and technologies in a cost effective and timely manner  the rate at which our present and future customers and end users adopt our products and technologies in our target markets  general economic and market conditions in the semiconductor industry and communications markets  combinations of companies in our customer base  resulting in the combined company choosing our competitor s ic standardization other than our supported product platforms  the gain or loss of one or more key customers  or their key customers  or significant changes in the financial condition of one or more of our key customers or their key customers  our ability to meet customer demand due to capacity constraints at our suppliers  and natural disasters that could affect our supply chain or our customer s supply chain which would affect their requirements of our products 
for these and other reasons  our net revenue and results of operations for the three fiscal years ended march  may not necessarily be indicative of future net revenue and results of operations 
based on direct shipments  net revenues to customers that was equal to or greater than of total net revenues in any of the three years ended march  were as follows avnet distributor hon hai sub contract manufacturer less than of total net revenues for period indicated 
we expect that our largest customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue for the foreseeable future 
net revenues by geographic region were as follows in thousands fiscal years ended march  united states of america taiwan hong kong china europe other asia other 
table of contents all of our revenues are primarily denominated in us dollars  other than revenues for tpack which are denominated primarily in danish kroner 
sale of the ware storage adapter business to lsi corporation 
we completed the sale of our ware storage adapter business the transaction to lsi corporation on april  under the asset purchase agreement with lsi corporation the purchase agreement  we sold substantially all of the operating assets other than patents of our ware storage adapter business 
the adjusted purchase price was approximately million 
unless otherwise specified  all amounts discussed in the management s discussion and analysis addresses only continuing operations 
key non gaap measurements 
we use certain non gaap metrics such as adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda to measure our performance 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss less interest income  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  amortization of intangibles and other one time and or non cash items 
the following table reconciles adjusted ebitda to the accompanying financial statements fiscal years ended march  net loss adjustment to net loss interest and other income  net stock based compensation expense amortization of intangibles restructuring charges litigation settlement goodwill impairment charges impairment of marketable securities depreciation and amortization option investigation loss strategic investment acquisition transaction expenses other and income tax adjustment gain loss from discontinued operations adjusted ebitda for non gaap purposes  any gain or loss relating to marketable securities is not recognized until the underlying securities are sold and the actual gain or loss is realized 
we believe that adjusted ebitda is a useful supplemental measure of our operation s performance because it helps investors evaluate and compare the results of operations from period to period by removing the accounting impact of the company s financing strategies  tax provisions  depreciation and amortization  restructuring charges  stock based compensation expense  discontinued operations and certain other operating items 
we adjust for these excluded items because we believe that  in general  these items possess one or more of the following characteristics their magnitude and timing is largely outside of the company s control  they are unrelated to the ongoing operations of the business in the ordinary course  they are unusual or infrequent and the company does not expect them to occur in the ordinary course of business  or they are non cash expenses 
adjusted ebitda is not a measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap  and should not be considered a substitute for operating income  net income or any other measure determined in accordance with gaap 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
adjusted ebitda is used by our management as a measure of operating efficiency and overall financial performance for benchmarking 
table of contents against our peers and competitors and is used as a metric to determine the performance vesting of our three year restricted stock unit grants issued in may the ebitda grants in the fiscal years ended march  and and will be used for the fiscal year ending march  management believes adjusted ebitda provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the underlying operating performance of our business 
management also believes that adjusted ebitda is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties to evaluate the company 
the book to bill ratio is another metric commonly used by investors to compare and evaluate technology and semiconductor companies 
the book to bill ratio is a demand to supply ratio that compares the total amount of orders received to the total amount of orders filled 
this ratio tells whether the company has more orders than it delivered if greater than  has the same amount of orders that it delivered equals  or has less orders than it delivered under 
though the ratio provides an indicator of whether orders are rising or falling  it does not consider the timing of or if the order will result in future revenues 
our book to bill ratio at march   and was  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to inventory valuation and capitalized mask set costs  which affect our cost of sales and gross profit  the valuation of goodwill and purchased intangibles  which has in the past affected  and could in the future affect  our impairment charges to write down the carrying value of purchased intangibles and the amount of related periodic amortization expense recorded for definite lived intangibles  the valuation of restructuring liabilities  which affects the amount and timing of restructuring charges  and an evaluation of other than temporary impairment of our investments  which affects the amount and timing of write down charges 
we also have other key accounting policies  such as our policies for stock based compensation and revenue recognition 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying these critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from management s estimates 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
investments we hold a variety of securities that have varied underlying investments 
we review our investment portfolio periodically to assess for other than temporary impairment 
we assess the existence of impairment of our investments in order to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary 
the factors used to determine whether an impairment is temporary or other than temporary involves considerable judgment 
the factors we consider in determining whether any individual impairment is temporary or other than temporary are primarily the length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than amortized cost  the nature of underlying assets including the degree of collateralization  the financial condition  credit rating  market liquidity conditions and near term prospects of the issuer 
if the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost basis at the balance sheet date  an assessment would have to be made as to whether the impairment is other than temporary 
if we decided to sell the security  an other than temporary impairment shall be considered to have occurred 
however  if we do not intend to sell the debt security  we shall consider available evidence to assess whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis due to cash  working capital requirements  contractual or 
table of contents regulatory obligations indicate that the security will be required to be sold before a forecasted recovery occurs 
if it is more likely than not that we are required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  an other than temporary impairment is considered to have occurred 
if we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security  we would not be able to assert that we will recover its amortized cost basis even if we do not intend to sell the security 
therefore  in those situations  an other than temporary impairment shall be considered to have occurred 
use of present value cash flow models to determine whether the entire amortized cost basis of the security will be recovered is expected 
we will compare the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security 
an other than temporary impairment is said to have occurred if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security 
in the fiscal year ended march   we did not record any other than temporary impairment charges 
as of march   we did not record an impairment charge in connection with other securities in a continuous loss position fair value less than carrying value with unrealized losses of million as we believe that such unrealized losses are temporary 
in addition  we also had million in unrealized gains 
for the fiscal years ended march  and  we recorded other than temporary impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
inventory valuation our policy is to value inventories at the lower of cost or market on a part by part basis 
this policy requires us to make estimates regarding the market value of our inventories  including an assessment of excess or obsolete inventories 
we determine excess and obsolete inventories based on an estimate of the future demand for our products within a specified time horizon  generally months 
the estimates we use for future demand are also used for near term capacity planning and inventory purchasing and are consistent with our revenue forecasts 
if our demand forecast is greater than our actual demand we may be required to take additional excess inventory charges  which would decrease gross margin and net operating results 
any impairment charges taken establishes a new cost basis for the underlying inventory and the cost basis for such inventory is not marked up on changes in circumstances until a gain is realized upon its eventual sale 
this accounting is consistent with the guidance provided by sab topic bb 
to illustrate the sensitivity of inventory valuations to future estimates  as of march   reducing our future demand estimate to six months would decrease our current inventory valuation by approximately million or increasing our future demand forecast to months would not have any effect on our current inventory valuation 
goodwill  purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired  such as purchased technology 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment tests 
the values and useful lives assigned to other purchased intangible assets impact future amortization 
determining the fair values and useful lives of intangible assets requires the use of estimates and the exercise of judgment on factors such as expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired 
while there are a number of different generally accepted valuation methods to estimate the value of intangible assets acquired  we primarily use the discounted cash flow method and the market comparison approach 
these methods require significant management judgment to forecast the future operating results used in the analysis 
in addition  other significant estimates are required such as residual growth rates and discount factors 
the estimates we use to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages 
these judgments can significantly affect our net operating results 
in accordance with asc topic asc as it relates to goodwill and other intangible assets  we perform our annual impairment review at the reporting unit level each fiscal year or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment are present 
we recently finalized the purchase price allocation for the 
table of contents tpack acquisition 
asc requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques 
specifically  goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
goodwill is allocated to reporting units based upon the type of products under development by the acquired company  which initially generated the goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the fair value is determined using a combination of the discounted cash flow analysis and or market comparisons 
the determination of fair value requires significant judgment and estimates 
we last recorded goodwill impairment charges in the year ended march  of million to continuing operations and million to discontinued operations 
during the fiscal year ended march   in conjunction with the tpack acquisition  we recorded million in amortizable intangible assets and million in goodwill 
we evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances require revising the remaining period of amortization 
we evaluate our long lived assets such as property  plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets with finite lives  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
the carrying value of an asset or asset group is not recoverable if the amount of undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate including any net proceeds expected from the disposal of the asset are less than its carrying value 
when we identify an impairment has occurred  we reduce the carrying value of the assets to its comparable market value if available and appropriate or to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow approach 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue based on four basic criteria there is evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue upon determination that all criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
in addition  we do not recognize revenue until the applicable customer s acceptance criteria have been met 
the criteria are usually met at the time of product shipment 
our standard terms and conditions of sale do not allow for product returns and we generally do not allow product returns other than under warranty or stock rotation agreements 
revenue from shipments to distributors is recognized upon shipment 
in addition  we record reductions to revenue for estimated allowances such as returns not pursuant to contractual rights  competitive pricing programs and rebates 
these estimates are based on our experience with stock rotations and the contractual terms of the competitive pricing and rebate programs 
royalty revenues are recognized when cash is received  only when royalty amounts cannot be reasonably estimated 
royalty revenues are based upon sales of our customer s products that include our software 
shipping terms are generally fca free carrier shipping point 
if actual returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates  we would record additional reductions to revenue 
from time to time we generate revenue from the sale of our internally developed ip 
we generally recognize revenue from the sale of ip when all basic criteria outlined above are met  which is generally when the payments are received 

table of contents mask costs we incur significant costs for the fabrication of masks used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture our products 
if we determine  at the time the cost for the fabrication of masks are incurred  that technological feasibility of the product has been achieved  we consider the nature of these costs to be pre production costs 
accordingly  such costs are capitalized as property and equipment under machinery and equipment and are amortized as cost of sales over approximately three years  representing the estimated production period of the product 
if we determine  at the time fabrication mask costs are incurred  that either technological feasibility of the product has not occurred or that the mask is not reasonably expected to be used in production manufacturing or that the commercial feasibility of the product is uncertain  the related mask costs are expensed to r d in the period in which the costs are incurred 
we will also periodically assess capitalized mask costs for impairment 
during the fiscal year ended march   total mask costs of million were incurred  of which million was expensed as r d expense because technological feasibility had not been achieved and the remaining million was capitalized 
during the fiscal year ended march   we made a correction resulting in the recognition of an asset totaling million for unamortized mask costs incurred in prior periods as it was determined that these costs represented pre production costs instead of r d expenses 
the unamortized costs will be amortized as cost of sales over a period of approximately three years 
as part of this correction we recognized a reduction to r d expenses of approximately million 
amortization of these capitalized mask set costs that have been recognized as cost of sales during the fiscal year ended march  were approximately million 
the net adjustments to make the correction to capitalize mask costs were not material to any periods affected 
stock based compensation expense all share based payments  including grants of stock options  restricted stock units and employee stock purchase rights  are required to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values 
the fair value of each employee stock option and employee stock purchase right is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model that meets certain requirements 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our share based payments  excluding rsus  which we use the fair market value of our common stock 
the fair values generated by the black scholes model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our stock based awards as it does not consider certain factors important to stock based awards  such as continued employment  periodic vesting requirements and limited transferability 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards utilizing the black scholes model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected volatility of our stock options at grant date by equally weighting the historical volatility and the implied volatility of our stock over specific periods of time as the expected volatility assumption required in the black scholes model 
the expected life of the stock options is based on historical and other data including life of the option and vesting period 
the risk free interest rate assumption is the implied yield currently available on zero coupon government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
the fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ significantly from those estimated 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value stock based awards on a quarterly basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
we currently estimate when and if performance based grants will be earned 
if the awards are not considered probable of achievement  no amount of stock based compensation is recognized 
if we consider the award to be probable  expense is recorded over the estimated service period 
to the extent that our assumptions are incorrect  the amount of stock based compensation recorded will be increased or decreased 
to the extent that we grant additional equity securities to employees or we assume unvested securities in connection with any acquisitions  our stock based compensation expense will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants or acquisitions 

table of contents restructuring charges over the last several years we have undertaken significant restructuring initiatives  which have required us to develop formalized plans for exiting certain business activities and reducing spending levels 
we have had to record estimated expenses for employee severance  long term asset write downs  lease cancellations  facilities consolidation costs  and other restructuring costs 
given the significance  and the timing of the execution  of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made 
our assumptions for exiting certain facilities  such as estimating sublease incomes  may differ from actual outcomes  which could result in the need to record additional costs or reduce estimated amounts previously charged to restructuring expense 
our policies require us to periodically evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
during the fiscal year ended march   we recorded net restructuring charges of approximately million associated with our restructuring actions 
in the fiscal year ended march   we recorded net restructuring charges of approximately million associated with our restructuring actions to continuing operations 
in the fiscal year ended march   we recorded net charges of million for our restructuring activities  of which million was classified as discontinued operations

results of operations comparison of the fiscal year ended march  to the fiscal year ended march  net revenues 
net revenues for the fiscal year ended march  were million  representing an increase of from the net revenues of million for the fiscal year ended march  we classify our revenues into two categories based on the markets that the underlying products serve 
the categories are process and transport 
we use this information to analyze our performance and success in these markets 
see the following tables dollars in thousands fiscal years ended march  increase change amount of net revenue amount of net revenue process transport during the fiscal year ended march   revenues recovered strongly as the overall market for semiconductor products continued to show improved growth trends 
the year over year increase represents the recovery from the recessionary economic conditions and overall softness in demand that was observed during the prior years and the current pace of infrastructure build out 
though revenues increased year over year  revenues decreased in the fourth fiscal quarter compared to the preceeding three month period primarily due to inventory corrections in the industry 
we expect that additional channel inventories will be consumed over the next several quarters 
we expect revenues for the three months ending june  to be approximately million  plus or minus million 
this represents an increase of approximately  compared to the revenues for the three months ended march  our future revenues could be impacted by various factors  including the duration and the severity of inventory corrections and other factors

vesting of the ebitda grants is subject to i the company s performance as measured by earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  and ii individual performance as measured by the accomplishment of goals and objectives 
the weighted average period over which the unearned stock based compensation is expected to be recognized is approximately years 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
future stock based compensation expense will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards 
the value of these grants cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on the number of share based payments granted and the then current fair values

in addition  during the fiscal years ended march  and  we also recorded million and million in licensing revenues  respectively  under transport from the sale of certain non core patents and associated rights 
the decline in the process revenues was consistent with the overall decline in market conditions while the transport revenues improved marginally and which were further supplemented by the incremental licensing revenues  as discussed above 
the geographical mix of our revenues depends on the location of our end customers or distributors and may change from time to time 
the lower revenues attributable to other north america in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the drop in revenues relating to a customer in canada

we have established guidelines relative to diversification and maturities that attempt to maintain safety and liquidity 
these guidelines are periodically reviewed and modified to take advantage of interest rate trends 
we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us treasury  corporate bonds  mortgage backed and asset backed securities  mutual funds and closed end bond funds  with credit ratings as specified in our investment policy 
we also have invested in preferred stocks  which pay quarterly fixed rate dividends 
we generally do not utilize derivatives to hedge against increases in interest rates which decrease market values 
we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments 
at march   our investment portfolio included short term securities classified as available for sale investments with an aggregate fair market value of million and a cost basis of million 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk  as well as credit risk and liquidity risk  and will decline in value if interest rates increase or an issuer s credit rating or financial condition is decreased 
the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value of our short term investments held at march  in thousands valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of x basis points bps fair value as of march  valuation of securities given an interest rate increase of x basis points bps bps bps bps bps bps bps available for sale investments 
table of contents the modeling technique used measures the change in fair market value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points  basis points  and basis points 
while this modeling technique provides a measure of our exposure to market risk  the current economic turbulence could cause interest rates to shift by more than basis points 
we also invest in equity instruments of private companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are valued based on our historical cost  less any recognized impairments 
the estimated fair values are not necessarily representative of the amounts that we could realize in a current transaction 
we generally conduct business  including sales to foreign customers  in us dollars  and as a result  we have limited foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we did not enter into any forward currency exchange contract during the fiscal year ended march  gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts that are designated and effective as hedges of anticipated transactions  for which a firm commitment has been attained  are deferred and included in the basis of the transaction in the same period that the underlying transaction is settled 
gains and losses on any instruments not meeting the above criteria are recognized in income or expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the current period
