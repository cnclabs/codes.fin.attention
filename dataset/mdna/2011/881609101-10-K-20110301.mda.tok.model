industry overview our profitability is heavily influenced by the cost of crude oil and the aggregate value of the products we make from that crude oil and is also affected by changes in economic conditions 
product values and crude oil costs are set by the market and are outside of the control of independent refiners 
crude oil price and product margin analysis the overall us economy  including that of the west coast  has shown signs of improvement  though these improvements have not consistently translated into stronger demand for refined products 
measures of commercial activity that are correlated with oil demand showed improvement  particularly in the second half of container traffic at the five largest west coast ports recovered to their levels in august and have remained above levels since may in  self reported available seat miles at the largest us flagged air carriers were higher than the previous year  with year on year growth for the second half of of 
us gross domestic product continues to grow 
however  the recovery to date has been without an accompanying improvement in the labor sector as unemployment remains above 
events in other countries during affected regional supply and demand fundamentals  such as outages at refineries in chile and mexico during the first half of the year 
the effect of these events was relatively short lived but provided upward pressure on margins by decreasing excess refinery capacity 

table of contents the following table depicts average key crude oil pricing and west coast benchmark product margins for and performace graph improved west coast distillate supply and demand fundamentals led to improved diesel margins in as compared to during  us west coast benchmark diesel fuel margins increased by approximately due to strengthening commercial activity  diesel exports and refinery outages 
however  west coast gasoline margins decreased in by over primarily due to continued lower demand  increased alternative fuel supply and spare refining capacity 
outlook the slow recovery of the global and domestic economies  coupled with persistent high unemployment in the us is expected to continue to negatively impact demand for refined products 
the impact of reduced demand has been compounded by excess global refining capacity and historically high inventory levels 
these conditions have continued to put pressure on refined product margins 
recently  we have seen improvements in regional margins and expect margins to be slightly higher in as compared to in addition to current market conditions  there are long term factors that may impact the supply and demand of refined products in the us these factors include higher fuel efficiency standards for vehicles  mandated renewable fuels standards  potential and enacted climate change legislation  including the epa regulation of greenhouse gas emissions under the clean air act  and competing refineries being built overseas 

table of contents results of operations a discussion and analysis of the factors contributing to our results of operations is presented below 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements in item  together with the following information  are intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our historical operations  but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance 
summary our net loss in was million per diluted share compared with a net loss of million per diluted share in the increase in net earnings of per diluted share was primarily due to the following contribution from our capital and non capital initiative program during which increased our overall margin through reduced transportation and feedstock costs  increased product margins  and improved refinery yields  increased gross refining margins due to local crude discounts and improved distillate margins partially offset by weaker gasoline margins  a million gain from the elimination of postretirement life insurance benefits for current and future retirees as part of our strategy to reduce overhead and benefit expenses  a million decrease in losses on our derivative instruments  improved contribution of million from our retail marketing segment  and a goodwill write off of million in compared to million in the increase in net earnings during relative to was partially offset by the following lower throughput primarily from the temporary shut down of processing at our washington refinery and completion of scheduled refinery turnarounds at several of our other refineries 
the gross margin impact of the temporary shut down at the washington refinery was partially offset by the receipt of million in business interruption insurance recoveries  a million increase in incentive and stock based compensation expense 
the increase in stock based compensation is related to our stock appreciation rights and phantom stock options which increased primarily as a result of increases in tesoro stock prices during as compared to  a reduction in cost of sales of million resulting from a lifo liquidation benefit during  and additional operating expenses of million directly related to the april   incident at our washington refinery  partially offset by million in property insurance recoveries 
our net loss in was million per diluted share compared with net earnings of million per diluted share in the decrease in net earnings of per diluted share was primarily due to the following significantly lower industry distillate margins primarily from reduced demand and excess inventories  the narrowing of price differentials between heavy and light crude oils  a lower lifo liquidation benefit of million in compared to million in  a goodwill write off of million  the impact of scheduled and unscheduled downtime  and refunds received in totaling million in connection with our protest of intrastate pipeline rates 
the decrease in net earnings during relative to was partially offset by the following higher industry gasoline margins on the us west coast  reduced refining operating expenses by million primarily reflecting decreased utility costs and lower refining throughput  and a million bad debt charge in

operating income for our refining segment increased by million  or to million during as compared to million during the increase primarily reflects improved total gross refining margins of million during the year 
the increase in gross margin was partially offset by an increase of million in manufacturing and other operating expenses 
gross refining margins 
our gross refining margin per barrel increased by per barrel  or  to per barrel in as compared to per barrel in  primarily due to significantly higher industry diesel fuel margins and our initiatives to improve our margin capture rates  partially offset by lower industry margins for gasoline 
industry diesel fuel margins in the us west coast region increased  primarily due to strong exports and increased manufacturing activity nationwide 
industry gasoline margins on the us west coast decreased in as compared to reflecting poor global demand and higher inventories resulting from high domestic unemployment rates 
during  we reduced our transportation and feedstock costs  realized better refinery yields and improved margins on finished products  which improved consolidated gross margin 
our california refineries benefited from improved product yields and increased throughput of discounted foreign heavy crude oils as these refineries run a high proportion of heavy crude oils of total refining throughput during 
in addition  we experienced higher gross refining margins at our mid continent refineries due to increased use of discounted local crudes and downtime at other refineries in the region 
see industry overview for additional information on the increase in industry diesel margins and the decrease in industry gasoline margins during 
table of contents we periodically use non trading derivative instruments to primarily manage exposure to commodity price risks associated with the purchase or sale of crude oil and finished products 
we may also use non trading derivative instruments to manage price risks associated with inventories above or below our target levels 
gains or losses associated with our derivative instruments are included in gross refining margin 
our losses totaled million during versus million during crude prices increased significantly during compared to marginal increases during this pricing difference and lower price volatility improved derivative results during refining throughput 
total refining throughput declined mbpd  or  to mbpd during as compared to mbpd during primarily due to the following the temporary shutdown of processing at the washington refinery subsequent to the april   naphtha hydrotreater fire 
the gross margin impact of the reduced throughput was partially offset by million in business interruption insurance recoveries recorded as an offset to cost of sales  scheduled turnarounds at our hawaii  north dakota  golden eagle and utah refineries 
total refining throughput during was impacted by scheduled turnarounds at our alaska and golden eagle refineries  scheduled maintenance at our washington refinery and unscheduled downtime at the los angeles refinery 
refined products sales 
revenues from sales of refined products increased billion  or  to billion in as compared to billion in  primarily due to higher average refined product sales prices  partially offset by lower refined product sales volumes 
our average product sales price increased per barrel  or  to per barrel in as compared to in  due to higher average crude oil prices placing upward pressure on product prices 
total refined product sales decreased by mbpd  or  to mbpd in as compared to mbpd in  primarily reflecting lower product demand 
cost of sales and expenses 
our average cost of sales increased by per barrel  or  to per barrel during as compared to during  reflecting higher average crude oil prices 
manufacturing and other operating expenses increased by million  or  to billion in  primarily due to million in charges  net of property insurance recoveries  directly related to the april   incident at the washington refinery coupled with higher natural gas costs at our california refineries  partially offset by a million gain in operating expenses from the elimination of postretirement life insurance benefits 
refining depreciation and amortization expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses had nominal changes in with an increase of million and decrease of million  respectively 
loss on asset disposals and impairments 
loss on asset disposals decreased by million  or  primarily due to a decrease in the goodwill write offs of million  partially offset by an increase in refining equipment impairment charges at our los angeles refinery of million 
the goodwill write off of million was a result of an increase in the net book value of our hawaii refinery reporting unit compared to a decrease in its fair value resulting from decreases in forecasted cash flows 
for further discussion  see note e to our consolidated financial statements in item the million loss on asset disposals at our los angeles refinery in relates to the deferral of a capital project at our los angeles refinery  which resulted in a write down to fair value of equipment specifically manufactured and uniquely configured for the project 
compared to overview 
operating income for our refining segment decreased by million  or  to million during as compared to million during the decrease primarily reflects a lower gross refining margin partially offset by a decrease in manufacturing and other operating expenses of million 
the impact of a lower per barrel gross refining margin decreased total gross refining margins by million during the year 
operating income included a goodwill write off of million during and a bad debt charge of million during our operating income in both periods benefited from a reduction in cost of sales from decreasing lifo inventory layers acquired at lower per barrel costs 
these inventory reductions resulted in operating income improvements of million during and million during 
table of contents gross refining margins 
our gross refining margin per barrel decreased by per barrel  or  to per barrel in as compared to per barrel in  due to significantly lower industry diesel fuel and jet fuel margins  partially offset by higher industry margins for gasoline and heavy products 
the decrease in industry diesel fuel margins throughout reflected lower global demand and significantly higher us inventories 
industry gasoline margins on the us west coast improved in as compared to primarily due to heavy scheduled and unscheduled industry downtime and lower average gasoline inventories 
our california region was negatively impacted by a reduction in heavy and light crude oil price differentials that reduced gross refining margin during  because our california refineries run a high proportion of heavy crude oils of total refining throughput during 
our derivative losses totaled million during versus million during the decrease in our losses reflected the impact of changing our hedging strategy 
during the second quarter  we closed the majority of our crude oil derivative positions associated with our long haul strategy that matched the price of long haul crude oils to crude oil prices on the day of processing 
refining throughput 
total refining throughput declined mbpd  or  to mbpd during as compared to mbpd during  primarily due to matching production to lower demand and the following refinery wide turnarounds at the alaska and golden eagle refineries  scheduled maintenance at the washington refinery  and unscheduled downtime of the delayed coker at the los angeles refinery

net cash from financing activities decreased million or to million in from million in primarily due to million in net borrowings under the tpsa revolving credit facility in offset by net proceeds on our senior note issuance of million  net repayments on our revolver of million and dividend payments of million in working capital excluding cash was a source of million in cash for the year ending december   primarily related to a run up in crude and product prices towards the end of the year 
we collect our receivables approximately three times faster than we pay our payables  the majority of which settle on the th of the month following the date of crude delivery 
in a period of rising crude oil and product prices  we collect higher product prices sooner than we pay for more expensive crude purchases 
inventories increased by approximately seven million barrels from december  this was offset by corresponding increases in accounts payable and current maturities of long term debt in the statement of consolidated cash flows 

table of contents compared to net cash from operating activities decreased million  or  to million in as compared to million in primarily due to lower cash earnings  partially offset by lower working capital requirements 
net cash used in investing activities decreased million  or  to million in as compared to million in primarily as a result of decreased capital expenditures 
net cash from used in financing activities increased million or to million in from million in primarily due to the net proceeds from our senior notes issuance partially offset by repayments on our revolver and dividend payments 
gross borrowings under our revolving credit agreement totaled million  and we repaid million in borrowings during working capital excluding cash decreased million at december  from million at december   as payables increased by a larger amount than both receivables and inventories due to higher crude oil prices at year end 
inventories decreased by approximately million barrels from december  reflecting our initiatives to optimize working capital and matching production to lower product demand 
capital expenditures our capital budget for is million 
our capital spending during was million compared to our capital budget of million 
our budgeted and actual capital spending amounts are comprised of the following project categories at december  percent of percent of project category capital budget capital spending regulatory sustaining income improvement the capital spending plans for reflect the company s strategic priorities including continued focus on safety and reliability and greater focus on value driven growth 
sustaining capital expenditures  primarily repairs and maintenance not related to turnaround activity  are expected to remain at about of our total capital expenditures in spending on income improvement projects is expected to increase from of all capital dollars to in as the company puts greater focus on these value added projects which are expected to improve yields  reduce costs and expand our infrastructure 
regulatory spending as a percent of total spending declines though total dollars expected to be spent remains relatively constant 
see business strategy and overview and environmental capital expenditures for additional information 
refinery turnaround spending our budget for refinery turnarounds and catalyst is million 
the turnaround spending is primarily at our golden eagle and los angeles refineries 
refining throughput and yields in will be affected by these turnarounds 
during  we spent million for refinery turnarounds and catalyst  primarily at our utah  golden eagle  north dakota and hawaii refineries 

table of contents long term commitments contractual commitments we have numerous contractual commitments for purchases associated with the operation of our refineries  debt service and leases see notes j and n to our consolidated financial statements in item 
we also have minimum contractual spending requirements for certain capital projects 
the following table summarizes our annual contractual commitments as of december  in millions contractual obligation total thereafter long term debt obligations a capital lease obligations b operating lease obligations b crude oil supply obligations c other purchase obligations d capital expenditure obligations e other noncurrent liabilities f total contractual obligations a includes maturities of principal and interest payments  excluding capital lease obligations 
amounts and timing may be different from our estimated commitments due to potential voluntary debt prepayments and borrowings 
b capital lease obligations include amounts classified as interest 
operating lease obligations primarily represent our future minimum noncancellable lease commitments 
operating lease obligations primarily include lease arrangements with initial or remaining noncancellable terms in excess of one year and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases 
c represents an estimate of our short term and long term contractual purchase commitments for crude oil  with remaining terms ranging from six months to five years 
prices under these term agreements fluctuate due to market responsive pricing provisions 
to estimate our annual commitments under these contracts  we estimated crude oil prices using actual market prices by crude oil type as of december   with prices ranging from per barrel to per barrel  and volumes based on the contract s minimum purchase requirements 
we also purchase additional crude oil under short term renewable contracts and in the spot market  which is not included in the table above 
d represents primarily long term commitments for the transportation of crude oil and refined products as well as to purchase industrial gases  chemical processing services and utilities at our refineries 
these purchase obligations are based on the contract s minimum volume requirements 
e minimum contractual spending requirements for certain capital projects 
f we have included the future estimated benefit payments for our defined pension plans and other postretirement benefits as these obligations represent the majority of our other noncurrent liabilities 
see note m to our consolidated financial statements in item for additional information 
with the exception of amounts classified as current there is uncertainty as to the timing of future cash flows related to environmental liabilities and asset retirement obligations 
as such  we have excluded the future cash flows from the contractual commitments table above 
see additional information on environmental liabilities and asset retirement obligations in note i and note k  respectively  to our consolidated financial statements in item in addition  due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows with our unrecognized tax benefits  with the exception of amounts classified as current  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement 
accordingly  we have excluded million of unrecognized tax benefits recorded as liabilities  million of which is classified as current in the consolidated balance sheet  from the contractual commitments table above 
related to these unrecognized tax benefits  we have also recorded a liability for potential interest and penalties of million at december   million of which is classified as current in the consolidated balance sheet 
see note l to our consolidated financial statements in item for further information 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements other than our leasing arrangements described in note n to our consolidated financial statements in item  we have not entered into any transactions  agreements or other contractual arrangements that would result in off balance sheet liabilities 
environmental and other matters we are a party to various litigation and contingent loss situations  including environmental and income tax matters  arising in the ordinary course of business 
although we cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of these matters with certainty  we have accrued for the estimated liabilities when appropriate 
we believe that the outcome of these matters will not materially impact our liquidity and consolidated financial position  although the resolution of certain of these matters could have a material impact on interim or annual results of operations 
additionally  if applicable  we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third party recoveries 
we are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
these laws  which change frequently  regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and may require us to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum or chemical substances at various sites  install additional controls  or make other modifications to certain emission sources 
future expenditures may be required to comply with proposed regulations under the clean air act and other federal  state and local requirements for our various sites  including our refineries  tank farms  pipelines  operating retail stations  closed retail stations operating refined products terminals and closed refined products terminals 
the impact of these legislative and regulatory developments  including any greenhouse gas cap and trade program or low carbon fuel standards  could result in increased compliance costs  additional operating restrictions on our business  and an increase in the cost of the products we manufacture  which could have an adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations  and liquidity 
in december  the us congress passed the energy independence and security act that created a second renewable fuels standard rfs 
this standard requires the total volume of renewable transportation fuels including ethanol and advanced biofuels sold or introduced in the us to reach billion gallons in  billion gallons in and rise to billion gallons by the requirements could reduce future demand growth for petroleum products that we manufacture 
in the near term  the rfs presents ethanol production and logistics challenges for the ethanol  alternative fuel and refining and marketing industries 
additional expenditures could be required to logistically accommodate the increased use of renewable transportation fuels 
in california  assembly bill ab  created a statewide cap on greenhouse gas emissions and requires that the state return to emission levels by ab focuses on using market mechanisms  such as a cap and trade program and a low carbon fuel standard lcfs to achieve emission reduction targets 
the lcfs became effective in january and requires a reduction in the carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel fuel by final regulations for all other aspects of ab  including cap and trade requirements  are being developed by carb  will take effect in  and will be fully implemented by the implementation and implications of ab will take many years to realize  and we cannot currently predict its impact on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
in  the epa proposed regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the clean air act 
the first of these regulations finalized on april   sets standards for the control of greenhouse gas emissions from light trucks and cars 
it could reduce the demand for our manufactured transportation fuels 
in addition  other proposed regulations include permitting requirements for stationary sources that emit greenhouse gases above a certain threshold 
the resulting permitting requirements could impose emission controls that increase required capital expenditures at our refineries 
we are subject to extensive federal  state and foreign tax laws and regulations 
newly enacted tax laws and regulations  and changes in existing tax laws and regulations  could result in increased expenditures in the future 
we are also subject to audits by federal  state and foreign taxing authorities in the normal course of business 
it is possible that tax audits could result in claims against us in excess of recorded liabilities 
we believe that resolution of any such claim s would not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we believe it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by as much as million in the next twelve months through settlements or other conclusions  primarily regarding state tax issues 

table of contents environmental liabilities we are  and expect to continue  incurring expenses for environmental liabilities at a number of currently and previously owned or operated refining  pipeline  terminal and retail station properties 
we have accrued liabilities for these expenses and believe these accruals are adequate 
at december  and december   our accruals for environmental expenditures totaled million and million  respectively 
our environmental accruals are based on estimates including engineering assessments and it is possible that our estimates will change and additional costs will be recorded as more information becomes available 
we received million in a settlement with a prior owner of our golden eagle refinery in in exchange for assuming responsibility for certain environmental liabilities arising from operations at the refinery prior to august these environmental liabilities totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
we cannot reasonably determine the full extent of remedial activities that may be required at the golden eagle refinery 
therefore  it is possible that we will identify additional remediation costs as more information becomes available 
we have filed insurance claims under environmental insurance policies that provide coverage up to million for expenditures in excess of the million in self insurance 
amounts recorded for environmental liabilities have not been reduced for possible insurance recoveries 
we are continuing to investigate conditions at certain active wastewater treatment units at our golden eagle refinery 
this investigation is driven by an order from the san francisco bay regional water quality control board that names us as well as two previous owners of the golden eagle refinery 
costs to investigate these conditions are included in our environmental accruals 
we cannot currently estimate the amount of the ultimate resolution of the order  but we believe it will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
washington refinery fire on april   the naphtha hydrotreater unit at our washington refinery was involved in a fire  which fatally injured seven employees and rendered the unit inoperable 
subsequent to the incident  refinery processing was temporarily shut down until after the unit reconstruction was completed 
the washington refinery resumed operations at planned rates in november in february  tesoro corporation  tesoro refining and marketing company and other defendants were named in a lawsuit brought by the estates and families of six of the seven fatally injured employees arising from the april  washington refinery incident 
in addition  a third party propane truck driver has alleged damages in the lawsuit 
the lawsuit includes allegations of negligence  premises liability  strict liability  product liability and seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages 
the company believes that it has defenses to the allegations contained in the lawsuit 
the case of donald and peggy zimmerman et al 
v 
tesoro corporation and tesoro refining and marketing et al 
is proceeding in the superior court of the state of washington  skagit county 
we are still evaluating the allegations contained in the lawsuit  however we believe that the outcome will not materially impact our liquidity and consolidated financial position 
we maintain comprehensive property including business interruption  workers compensation  and general liability insurance policies with significant loss limits 
our business interruption insurance deductible is satisfied after we have exceeded both days of operational disruption and million in losses primarily based on the operating plan that existed prior to the incident 
our property damage insurance has a million deductible 
we have filed business interruption insurance claims and property damage claims related to this incident 
during  we collected million in business interruption insurance recoveries that relate to downtime from april to august  which were recorded as an offset to cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations 
we have filed additional business interruption insurance claims and expect to settle remaining matters in the first half of we also filed claims for million in property damages and recorded million in property insurance recoveries  net of the million deductible 
these amounts were recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
we do not believe that this tragic incident will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
other matters in the ordinary course of business  we become party to lawsuits  administrative proceedings and governmental investigations  including environmental  regulatory and other matters 
large  and sometimes unspecified  damages or penalties may be sought from us in some matters for which the likelihood of loss may be reasonably possible but the amount of loss is not currently estimable 
as a result  we have not established accruals for these matters 
on the basis of existing information  we believe that the resolution of these matters  individually or in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents during  chevron filed a lawsuit against us claiming they are entitled to a share of the refunds we received in from the owners of the trans alaska pipeline system taps 
we received million in  net of contingent legal fees  for excessive intrastate rates charged by taps during though  and the period of through june chevron is asserting that it is entitled to a share of its portion of the refunds for retroactive price adjustments under our previous crude oil contracts with them 
in september  the trial court judge granted chevron s motion for summary judgment and awarded them million 
we disagree with the trial court and have appealed the decision to the alaska supreme court in which the proceeding is now pending 
we have established an accrual for this matter and believe that the outcome will not materially impact our liquidity and consolidated financial position 
we are a defendant  along with other manufacturing  supply and marketing defendants  in six lawsuits alleging mtbe contamination in groundwater 
we were served with the sixth lawsuit in april the defendants are being sued for having manufactured mtbe and having manufactured  supplied and distributed gasoline containing mtbe 
the plaintiffs in the six cases  all in california  are municipalities and governmental authorities 
the plaintiffs allege  in part  that the defendants are liable for manufacturing or distributing a defective product 
the suits generally seek individual  unquantified compensatory and punitive damages and attorney s fees 
we intend to vigorously assert our defenses against these claims 
on february   the epa filed suit against us alleging violations of the clean air act and corresponding regulatory requirements concerning the testing and reporting of transportation fuels and fuel additives 
in february  we received a notice of violation nov from the epa for the alleged violations arising from a compliance review conducted by the epa in for the years through the time of the review in we are discussing the alleged violations contained in the suit with the epa and the us department of justice and have not established an accrual for this matter 
on the basis of existing information  we believe that the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
on july   the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  also known as the financial reform act of  was signed into law 
key provisions of the act require that standardized swaps be cleared through a registered clearinghouse and executed on a registered trading platform with specific margin requirements 
these requirements could make these products more complicated or costly by creating new regulatory risks and increasing reporting  capital  and administrative requirements for companies that use derivatives for hedging and trading activities 
final rules on provisions in the legislation will be established and will take effect twelve months after the date of enactment 
although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this legislation  new regulations in this area may result in increased hedging costs and cash collateral requirements  and ultimately affect liquidity and working capital requirements 
prior to this year  we received two novs from the epa for the washington refinery alleging that prior to our acquisition of the refinery  certain modifications were made to the fluid catalytic cracking unit in violation of the clean air act 
we have investigated the allegations and believe we have defenses to the allegations and intend to vigorously defend ourselves 
prior to this year  we received a nov from the epa concerning our utah refinery alleging certain violations of the clean air act at the refinery beginning in we have investigated the allegations contained in the nov and sent the epa additional information in environmental capital expenditures the epa issued regulations in february that require the reduction of benzene in gasoline 
we spent million in  and plan to spend an additional million through at five of our refineries to comply with the regulations 
our california refineries will not require capital spending to meet the benzene reduction standards 
we have evaluated alternative projects for wharves at our golden eagle refinery to meet engineering and maintenance standards issued by the state of california in february and expect a commercial transaction could significantly reduce capital spending requirements 
we are currently working with a counterparty on this agreement 
based on the updated alternatives  we expect to spend million through the timing of these projects is being evaluated and is subject to change 

table of contents regulations issued by california s south coast air quality management district require the emission of nitrogen oxides to be initially reduced in at our los angeles refinery 
currently  we plan to meet this requirement by implementing operational changes  small capital projects and the continued management of our emissions credits 
we do not expect significant environmental capital expenditures in future years to satisfy these reductions 
other projects at our los angeles refinery include replacing underground pipelines with above ground pipelines to comply with an order from the california regional water quality control board 
we spent million in  and do not expect to spend significant environmental capital in future years to comply with these orders 
we spent approximately million to reconfigure and replace above ground storage tank systems at our golden eagle refinery during to comply with a california regional water quality board order 
we do not expect significant environmental capital expenditures in future years to comply with this order 
we spent million in to install equipment in the first quarter at our golden eagle refinery to eliminate the use of atmospheric blowdown towers as emergency relief systems 
we were required under a consent decree with the epa to reduce air emissions at our north dakota and utah refineries 
we spent million in to install emission controls for nitrogen oxides on boilers and heaters at these refineries 
we do not expect significant environmental capital expenditures in future years to comply with this order 
the cost estimates for the environmental projects described above are subject to further review and analysis and include estimates for capitalized interest and labor costs 
pension funding we provide a qualified defined benefit retirement plan for all eligible employees  with benefits based on years of service and compensation 
our long term expected return on plan assets is as of december   and our funded employee pension plan assets experienced a return of million in and a return of million in based on a discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of december   the fair values of the assets in our funded employee pension plan were equal to approximately of the projected benefit obligation as of the end of at january  the adjusted funding target attainment percentage a funding measure defined under applicable pension regulations was 
although tesoro had no minimum required contribution obligation to its funded employee pension plan under applicable laws and regulations in  we voluntarily contributed million to improve the funded status of the plan 
we currently are not required to fund any contributions in and continue to evaluate our expected voluntary contributions 
future contributions are affected by returns on plan assets  discount rates  employee demographics  regulatory environments and other factors
