item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a leading national provider of advanced outpatient diagnostic imaging and radiation therapy services  based upon annual revenue and number of systems deployed 
our principal sources of revenue are derived from magnetic resonance imaging mri and positron emission tomography computed tomography pet ct 
we provide imaging and therapeutic services primarily to hospitals and other healthcare providers on a shared service and full time service basis 
we also provide services through a growing number of fixed site imaging centers  primarily to hospitals or health systems 
our services normally include the use of our imaging systems  technologists to operate the systems  equipment maintenance and upgrades and management of day to day shared service and fixed site diagnostic imaging operations 
we also provide non scan based services  which include only the use of our imaging systems under a short term contract 
we have also leveraged our leadership in mri and pet ct to expand into radiation oncology and hospital outsourcing 
our radiation oncology business is operated through our wholly owned subsidiary  alliance oncology  llc ao  and includes a wide range of services for cancer patients covering initial consultation  preparation for treatment  simulation of treatment  actual radiation oncology delivery  therapy management and follow up care 
our services include the use of our linear accelerators  therapists to operate such systems  administrative staff  equipment maintenance and upgrades  and management of day to day operations 
we also provide stereotactic radiation oncology services through our wholly owned subsidiary  alliance radiosurgery  llc 
mri  pet ct and radiation oncology services generated  and of our revenue  respectively  for the year ended december    and of our revenue  respectively  for the year ended december  and and of our revenue  respectively  for the year ended december  our remaining revenue was comprised of other modality diagnostic imaging services revenue  primarily computed tomography ct and management contract revenue 
we had diagnostic imaging and radiation oncology systems  including mri systems and positron emission tomography pet or pet ct systems and served over  clients in states at december  we operated fixed site imaging centers three in unconsolidated joint ventures  which constitutes systems installed in hospitals or other medical buildings on or near hospital campuses  including modular buildings  systems installed inside medical groups offices  and free standing fixed site imaging centers  which include systems installed in a medical office building  ambulatory surgical center  or other retail space at december  of the fixed site imaging centers  were mri fixed site imaging centers  were pet or pet ct fixed site imaging centers  six were other modality fixed site imaging centers and three were in unconsolidated joint ventures 
we also operated radiation oncology centers and stereotactic radiosurgery facilities including two radiation oncology centers in unconsolidated joint ventures at december  approximately  and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  were generated by providing services to hospitals and other healthcare providers  which we refer to as wholesale revenues 
our wholesale revenues are typically generated from contracts that require our clients to pay us based on the number of scans we perform on patients on our clients behalf  although some pay us a flat fee for a period of time regardless of the number of scans we perform 
wholesale payments are due to us independent of our clients receipt of retail reimbursement from third party payors  although receipt of reimbursement from third party payors may affect demand for our services 
we typically deliver our services for a set number of days per week through exclusive  long term contracts with hospitals and other healthcare providers 
the initial terms of these contracts average approximately three years in length for mobile services and approximately five to years in length for fixed site arrangements 
these contracts often contain automatic renewal provisions and certain contracts have cancellation clauses if the hospital or other healthcare provider purchases their own system 
we price our contracts based on the type of system used  the scan volume  and the number of ancillary services provided 
pricing is also affected by competitive pressures 
approximately  and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  were generated by providing services directly to patients from our sites located at or near hospitals or other healthcare provider facilities  which we refer to as retail revenue 
our revenue from these sites is generated from direct billings to patients or their third party payors  including medicare  which are recorded net of contractual discounts and other arrangements for providing services at discounted prices 
we typically charge a higher price per scan under retail billing than we do under wholesale billing 
fixed site imaging centers and radiation oncology centers can be structured as either wholesale or retail arrangements 
our wholesale contracts for radiation oncology services average approximately to years in length 
revenues from these centers are included in either our wholesale or retail revenues 
with respect to our retail business  for services for which we bill medicare directly  we are paid under the medicare physician fee schedule  which is updated on an annual basis 
under the medicare statutory formula  payments under the physician fee schedule would have decreased for the past several years if congress failed to intervene 
in the past  when the application of the statutory formula resulted in lower payment  congress has passed interim legislation to prevent the reductions 
for  the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms projected a rate reduction of under the statutory formula and a number of legislative measures were passed to prevent this reduction 
for the second half of  the update factor was increased by 
for  the medicare and medicaid extenders act of which was signed into law on december   froze the update through because cms was required to make its other changes to the medicare physician fee schedule discussed below budget neutral  cms made a downward adjustment to what is known as the conversion factor  which translates values in dollar amounts 
whereas the conversion factor for the end of was  it is for at this time  we do not believe the change will have a material impact on our business 
if congress fails to intervene to prevent the negative update factor in the future through either another temporary measure or a permanent revision to the statutory formula  however  the resulting decrease in payment will adversely impact our revenues and results of operations 
for retail services furnished on or after july   cms began implementing a reduction in reimbursement for multiple images on contiguous body parts  as mandated by the recently enacted patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively  the ppaca 
this is a increase from prior years 
in its final medicare physician fee schedule rule for calendar year  effective january   cms will apply the same reduction to certain ct and ct angiography cta  mri and mr angiography mra  and ultrasound services furnished to the same patient in the same session  regardless of the imaging modality  and not limited to contiguous body areas 
cms projects that the final rule will reduce payment for more services than the current multiple procedure payment reduction policy 
cms expects that the final rule will primarily reduce payments for radiology services and to freestanding diagnostic imaging centers  such as our retail business 
at this time  we do not believe that the multiple procedure payment reductions will have a material impact on our future retail revenues 
regulatory updates to the physician fee schedule for calendar year include reduced payment rates for certain diagnostic services using equipment costing more than million through revisions to usage assumptions from the previous usage rate to a usage rate 
this utilization change  to be phased in over a four year period  applies to mri and ct scans  but not for radiation therapy and other therapeutic equipment 
the ppaca superseded cms s assumed usage rate for such equipment and  beginning on january   the ppaca requires cms to use a utilization rate 
for  cms also finalized its proposed rule to expand the list of services to which the higher equipment utilization rate assumption applies to include certain diagnostic cta and mra procedures using similar ct and mri scanners that cost more than million 
at this time  we estimate that the new usage assumptions for mri and ct scans under the ppaca  which became effective on january   will not have a material impact on our future retail revenues 
other regulatory changes to the medicare physician fee schedule involve revaluing certain components of the fee schedule payment rate  which impact radiology and other diagnostic tests  including the services we provide 
some of these changes are being transitioned over a four year period  with full implementation in for the transition payment  cms estimated that the aggregate impact of its changes which include the changes in the equipment utilization rate discussed above results in a reduction in radiation oncology  reduction in radiology  reduction in nuclear medicine and reduction for all suppliers providing the technical component of diagnostic tests generally 
to date these changes have not had a material impact on our retail revenues 
effective january   cms made further adjustments to the fee schedule so that specialties that have a higher proportion of the payment rate attributable to operating expenses such as equipment and supplies  which include radiation oncology  will experience an increase in aggregate payments 
in addition  as a result of adjustments to codes identified to be misvalued  radiation oncology specialties and suppliers providing the technical component of diagnostic tests are among the entities that will experience decreases in aggregate payment 
some of these changes will be transitioned  and cms estimates that the impact for which include the changes in the equipment utilization rate discussed above as well as the expanded multiple procedure payment reductions for certain imaging services will be a reduction in radiation oncology  reduction in radiology  reduction in nuclear medicine and reduction for all suppliers providing the technical component of diagnostic tests generally 
these estimated impacts are calculated prior to the application of the negative update factor discussed above 
at this time  we do not believe that the regulatory changes will have a material impact on our future retail revenues 
in addition to annual updates to the medicare physician fee schedule  as indicated above  cms also publishes regulatory changes to the hospital outpatient prospective payment system hopps on an annual basis 
these payments are the amounts received by our hospital clients for hospital outpatient services and summarized in the table below payment payment payment payment nonmyocardial pet and pet ct scan myocardial pet scan stereotactic radiosurgery treatment delivery systems depending on the level of service the pet and pet ct medicare hopps rate reductions did not have a material negative effect on revenue and earnings in  or at this time  however  we cannot predict the impact of future rate reductions on our future revenues or business 
the hopps and medicare physician fee schedule rules also implemented a number of ppaca provisions  including the waiver of beneficiary cost sharing for certain preventive services covered under medicare  such as screening mammograms and colonoscopies 
effective january   medicare beneficiaries will no longer be required to satisfy their deductibles or pay a copayment amount for these services 
cms states that by eliminating these out of pocket costs  beneficiaries will be encouraged to make full use of their medicare preventive benefits 
at this time  we cannot predict whether these changes will have a material impact on the demand for our services and or our future revenues 
over the past few years  the growth rate of mri industry wide scan volumes has slowed in part due to weak hospital volumes as reported by several investor owned hospital companies  additional patient related cost sharing programs and an increasing trend of third party payors intensifying their utilization management efforts  for example through benefit managers who require preauthorizations  to control the growth rate of imaging services generally 
we expect that these trends will continue throughout the remainder of another recent initiative to potentially reduce utilization of certain imaging services  authorized under mippa  is the medicare imaging demonstration  which is a two year demonstration project designed to collect data regarding physician use of advanced diagnostic imaging services 
this information would be used to determine the appropriateness of services by developing medical specialty guidelines for advanced imaging procedures within three designated modalities mri  ct and nuclear medicine 
on february   cms announced that it selected five participants for the demonstration project  although a start date has not yet been established 
in addition  we cannot predict the full extent of the ppaca on our business 
the reform law substantially changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers 
although certain provisions may negatively impact payment rates for certain imaging services  the ppaca also extends coverage to approximately million previously uninsured people which may result in an increase in the demand for our services 
further  we cannot predict at this time whether other legislative changes will be adopted  if any  or how these or future changes will affect the demand for our services 
we have experienced and continue to experience an increase in the competitive climate in the mri industry  resulting in an increase in activity by original equipment manufacturers  or oems  selling systems directly to certain of our clients  as well as medical groups 
typically  oems target our higher scan volume clients 
this increase in activity by oems has resulted in overcapacity of systems in the marketplace 
this has caused an increase in the number of our higher scan volume clients deciding not to renew their contracts 
we replace lost higher volume clients typically with lower volume clients 
our non scan based mri business has been impacted by a decline in the number of hospital construction projects  driven by a decrease in new mri systems being added by hospitals in their facilities and a decrease in the number of equipment upgrades occurring in the hospital market 
additionally  a growing number of medical groups have added imaging capacity within their practice setting which further increases competition in the industry 
our mri revenues decreased in compared to due to the factors described above  and we believe that mri revenues will continue to decline in future years 
recent global market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions and recession in most major economies which continued into and have not fully recovered 
continued concerns about the systemic impact of potential long term and wide spread recession  inflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the united states mortgage market and a declining real estate market in the united states have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the united states economy 
added concerns fueled by the united states government financial assistance to certain companies and other federal government s interventions in the united states financial system have led to increased market uncertainty and instability in both united states and international capital and credit markets 
these conditions  combined with volatile oil prices  declining business and consumer confidence  increased unemployment  increased tax rates and governmental budget deficits and debt levels have contributed to volatility of unprecedented levels 
we believe our mri and pet ct scan volumes have been impacted during  and will continue to be impacted in by high unemployment rates  the number of under insured or uninsured patients  the reported decline in physician office visits  hospitals adding imaging services in order to enhance hospital profitability and other conditions arising from the global economic conditions described above 
at this time  it is unclear what impact this might have on our future revenues or business 
as a result of these market conditions  the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide funding to borrowers 
continued turbulence in the united states and international markets and economies may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition  and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers 
if these market conditions continue  they may limit our ability to timely access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs  resulting in adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations 
the principal components of our cost of revenues are compensation paid to technologists and drivers  system maintenance costs  medical supplies  system transportation and technologists travel costs 
because a majority of these expenses are fixed  increased revenues as a result of higher scan volumes per system significantly improves our margins while lower scan volumes result in lower margins 
the principal components of selling  general and administrative expenses are sales and marketing costs  corporate overhead costs  provision for doubtful accounts  and share based payment 
we record noncontrolling interest and earnings from unconsolidated investees related to our consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries  respectively 
these subsidiaries primarily provide shared service and fixed site diagnostic imaging and therapeutic services 
seasonality we experience seasonality in the revenues and margins generated for our services 
first and fourth quarter revenues are typically lower than those from the second and third quarters 
first quarter revenue is affected primarily by fewer calendar days and inclement weather  typically resulting in fewer patients being scanned or treated during the period 
fourth quarter revenues are affected by holiday and client and patient vacation schedules  resulting in fewer scans or treatments during the period 
the variability in margins is higher than the variability in revenues due to the fixed nature of our costs 
we also experience fluctuations in the revenues and margins generated due to acquisition activity and general economic conditions  including recession or economic slowdown

additionally  the development of new projects  specifically in the radiation oncology segment  has taken longer than expected as the hospital decision making cycle has slowed causing longer than expected negotiation periods  further delaying the regulatory approval cycle and construction timelines 
during  we concluded that the fair value of the radiation oncology reporting unit was less than its carrying value and step of the analysis was performed to determine the amount of goodwill impairment 
as a result  we recorded impairment charges of million under asc related to goodwill in the radiation oncology segment 
we also recorded impairment charges of million under asc related to certain certificates of need with indefinite lives  million of which was related to the radiation oncology segment  and million of which was related to the imaging segment 
we recorded impairment charges of million under asc related to physician referral network intangible assets of which million was related to the radiation oncology segment  and million was related to the imaging segment 
we also recorded impairment charges of million under asc related to an other than temporary decline in the fair value of investments in two joint ventures 
for additional information  see goodwill and long lived assets in the below critical accounting policies and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
depreciation expense decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in amortization expense increased by million  or  to million in compared to million in  primarily due to the incremental amortization expense for intangible assets acquired in conjunction with our acquisitions in interest expense and other  net  increased million  or  to million in compared to million in  due to higher average interest rates on our credit facility and notes  million expense from a non cash fair value adjustment related to our interest rate swap agreements  which were de designated in  and an million non cash fair value adjustment related to our interest rate swap agreement with lehman commercial paper  inc lcpi in  which reduced the expense 
income tax benefit was million in compared to income tax expense of million in  resulting in effective tax rates of and in and  respectively 
our effective tax rates differed from the federal statutory rate principally as a result of state income taxes and permanent non deductible tax items  including share based payments  unrecognized tax benefits and other permanent differences 
earnings from unconsolidated investees increased by million  or  to million in compared to million in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest increased million  or  to million in compared to million in net loss attributable to alliance healthcare services  inc was million  or per share on a diluted basis  in compared to net income of million  or per share on a diluted basis  in year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue increased million  or  to million in compared to million in due to an increase in pet ct revenues  radiation oncology  other modalities and other revenue  partially offset by a decrease in mri revenues 
pet ct revenue in increased million  or  compared to total pet and pet ct scan volumes increased to  scans in from  scans in  primarily as a result of the acquisition of spi in the fourth quarter of  the acquisition of mos in the third quarter of and growth in our core pet business 
the average number of pet and pet ct systems in service increased to systems in from systems in these pet and pet ct increases were partially offset by a decline in the average price per pet and pet ct scan  to  per scan in compared to  per scan in the decline in the average price per pet and pet ct scan was primarily related to the spi acquisition  which was largely wholesale in nature and had a lower average price per scan on acquired customer contracts  as well as normal levels of pricing pressure from our wholesale customers 
scans per system per day also decreased  to scans per system per day in from scans per system per day in radiation oncology  other modalities and other revenue increased million  or  to million in compared to million in primarily due to an increase in the number of radiation oncology centers on operation 
mri revenue decreased million in  or 
scan based mri revenue decreased million in  or  to million in from million in scan based mri scan volume decreased to  scans in from  scans in  primarily due to a decrease in client demand 
scan based systems in service decreased to systems in from systems in average scans per system per day also decreased by to in from in these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the average price per mri scan 
the average price per mri scan increased to per scan in from per scan in non scan based mri revenue decreased million in compared to primarily due to a decline in the number of hospital construction projects and a decrease in the number of equipment upgrades occurring in the hospital market  both of which impact the demand for our non scan based mri business 
included in the revenue totals above is fixed site imaging center revenues  which increased million  or  to million in from million in we had mri systems at december  compared to mri systems at december  we had pet and pet ct systems at december  compared to pet and pet ct systems at december  we operated fixed site imaging centers including three in unconsolidated joint ventures at december   compared to fixed site imaging centers including four in unconsolidated joint ventures at december  we operated radiation oncology centers including two in unconsolidated joint ventures at december   compared to radiation oncology centers including two in unconsolidated joint ventures at december  cost of revenues  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased million  or  to million in compared to million in medical supplies increased million  or  primarily as a result of an increase in the number of pet and pet ct scans  which use a radiopharmaceutical as a component of the pet and pet ct scan 
maintenance and related costs increased million  or  due to an increase in service costs related to an increase in the number of pet ct systems in operation and the addition of radiation oncology systems 
compensation and related employee expenses increased million  or  primarily as a result of an increase in average headcount related to acquisitions completed in the second half of fuel expenses decreased million  or  primarily due to a decrease in the average price per gallon of diesel fuel costs 
equipment rental costs decreased million  or  primarily due to a lower number of rental systems in use to support current clients as a result of improved system utilization 
all other cost of revenues  excluding depreciation and amortization  decreased million  or 
cost of revenues  as a percentage of revenue  increased to in from in as a result of the factors described above 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in compared to million in compensation and related employee expenses increased million  or  as a result investments in the infrastructure of the oncology division and an increase in average headcount related to acquisitions completed in the second half of office expenses increased million  or  due to an increase in information technology expenses and other office expenses 
professional services expenses increased million  or  due to an increase in legal and other professional fees 
share based payment increased million  or  due to new equity awards granted in the provision for doubtful accounts decreased million  or  primarily due to the collections of aged wholesale receivables and a reduction in bad debt related to our retail receivables 
the provision for doubtful accounts  as a percentage of revenue  was of revenue in compared to in all other selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were and in and  respectively 
transaction costs were million due to acquisition related costs  which are now required to be expensed 
we recorded severance and related costs of million in compared to million in depreciation expense increased million  or  to million in compared to million in as a result of fixed assets acquired in connection with our acquisitions in the second half of amortization expense increased by million  or  to million in compared to million in  primarily due to the incremental amortization expense for intangible assets acquired in conjunction with our acquisitions in the second half of interest expense and other  net  decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to lower average rates on our credit facility 
we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of million in related to the refinance transaction  compared to million in income tax expense was million and million in and  respectively  resulting in effective tax rates of and in and  respectively 
our effective tax rates were higher than the federal statutory rates principally as a result of various permanent non deductible tax items  including share based payments  unrecognized tax benefits and other permanent differences 
earnings from unconsolidated investees decreased by million  or  to million in compared to million in due to a decrease in earnings from our unconsolidated investees 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interest increased million  or  to million in compared to million in  due to an increase in earnings from our consolidated subsidiaries 
net income attributable to alliance healthcare services  inc was million  or per share on a diluted basis  in compared to million  or per share on a diluted basis  in liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operating activities 
we generated million and million of cash flow from operating activities in and  respectively 
our ability to generate cash flow is affected by numerous factors  including demand for mri  pet ct  other diagnostic imaging and radiation oncology services 
our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is also dependent upon the collections of our accounts receivable 
the provision for doubtful accounts decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  our number of days of revenue outstanding for our accounts receivable was days and days as of december  and  respectively  which we believe is favorable compared to other diagnostic imaging and radiation oncology providers 
in addition  as of december   we had million of available borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
we used cash of million and million for investing activities in and  respectively 
investing activities in and include cash used for acquisitions of million and million  respectively 
investing activities in and include million and million  respectively  in cash provided by a decrease in cash in escrow 
we expect to continue to use cash for acquisitions in the future 
other than acquisitions  our primary use of capital resources is to fund capital expenditures 
we incur capital expenditures for the purposes of purchasing new systems  replacing less advanced systems with new systems  and providing upgrades of our mri  pet and pet ct  and radiation oncology systems and upgrading our corporate infrastructure for future growth 
capital expenditures totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during we purchased mri systems and pet ct systems 
we traded in or sold a total of systems during our decision to purchase a new system is typically predicated on obtaining new or extending existing client contracts  which serve as the basis of demand for the new system 
we expect to purchase additional systems in and finance substantially all of these purchases with our available cash  cash from operating activities  our revolving line of credit  and equipment leases 
based upon the client demand described above  which dictates the type of equipment purchased  we expect cash capital expenditures to total approximately to million in at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
this available cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts 
the invested cash is invested in interest bearing funds managed by third party financial institutions 
these funds invest in high quality money market instruments  primarily direct obligations of the government of the united states 
to date  we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our invested cash or cash equivalents  however  we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
at december   we had million in our accounts that are with third party financial institutions which exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance limits 
while we monitor daily the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate  these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
to date  we have experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in our operating accounts 
in december  we entered into a new senior secured credit agreement the new credit facility  comprised of a million term loan the new term loan maturing june and a million revolving facility the new revolving credit facility maturing december borrowings under the new term loan were issued at of par  with the discount to par being amortized to interest expense and other  net through the maturity date of the loan 
we used the proceeds from the new term loan to retire million of our old term loan 
borrowings under the new credit facility bear interest through maturity at a variable rate based upon  at our option  either libor or the base rate which is the highest of the administrative agent s prime rate  one half of in excess of the overnight federal funds rate  and in excess of the one month libor rate  plus in each case  an applicable margin 
with respect to the new term loan  the applicable margin for libor loans is per annum  and with respect to the new revolving credit facility  the applicable margin for libor loans ranges  based on the applicable leverage ratio  from to per annum  in each case  with a libor floor of 
with respect to the new term loan  the applicable margin for base rate loans is per annum  and with respect to the new revolving credit facility  the applicable margin for base rate loans ranges  based on the applicable leverage ratio  from to per annum 
at december   we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the new revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had million of available borrowings under our new revolving credit facility 
in addition to other covenants  the new credit facility places limits on our and our subsidiaries ability to declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock  prepay  redeem or purchase debt  incur liens and engage in sale leaseback transactions  make loans and investments  incur additional indebtedness  amend or otherwise alter debt and other material agreements  make capital expenditures  engage in mergers  acquisitions and asset sales  transact with affiliates and alter the business conducted by us and our subsidiaries 
the new credit facility also contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain i a maximum ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated adjusted ebitda of to through march   to from april  through march   to from april  to march  and to april  through the end of the agreement and ii a minimum ratio of consolidated adjusted ebitda to consolidated interest expense of to 
as of december   we are in compliance with all covenants contained in our new credit facility and expect that we will be in compliance with these covenants in however  if we are unable to generate sufficient consolidated adjusted ebitda  as defined in our credit agreement  or manage our indebtedness to sufficient levels  we could be out of compliance with our maximum consolidated leverage ratio and maximum consolidated senior leverage ratio 
our failure to comply with these covenants could permit the lenders under the credit agreement to declare all amounts borrowed under the agreement  together with accrued interest and fees  to be immediately due and payable 
if the indebtedness under the new credit facility is accelerated  we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts due under the credit facility 
if we are not able to refinance our debt  we could become subject to bankruptcy proceedings 
in december  we issued million of senior notes due the notes in a transaction that was exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act of  as amended 
the notes were issued at of par  with the discount to par being amortized to interest expense and other  net through the maturity date of the notes 
we used the proceeds from this transaction  the new term loan and existing cash to complete a tender offer and purchase million of our previously outstanding notes due at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount  together with the accrued interest to the redemption date 
we also used the proceeds from these transactions to redeem the remaining million of notes in january at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount  together with accrued interest to the redemption date 
the indenture governing the notes contains covenants limiting our and most of our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends and make other restricted payments  incur additional indebtedness or issue disqualified stock  create liens on our assets  merge  consolidate  or sell all or substantially all of our assets  and enter into transactions with affiliates  among others 
the notes are unsecured senior obligations and are equal in right of payment to all existing and future senior debt  and rank senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future subordinated debt 
the notes are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness  including indebtedness under our new credit facility  to the extent of assets securing such indebtedness  and are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all obligations of our subsidiaries 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the notes and forecast that we will be in compliance with these covenants in our failure to comply with these covenants could permit the trustee under the indenture relating to the notes and the note holders to declare the principal amounts under the notes  together with accrued and unpaid interest  to be immediately due and payable 
if the indebtedness under the notes  or any of our other indebtedness  is accelerated  and we are not able to refinance our debt  we could become subject to bankruptcy proceedings 
during the first quarter of  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of million each  to hedge future cash interest payments associated with a portion of our variable rate bank debt the swaps 
under the terms of these agreements  we receive three month libor and pay a fixed rate of 
the net effect of the hedges is to record interest expense at a fixed rate of  as the debt incurred interest based on three month libor plus 
these agreements are three years in length and mature in see below for additional information regarding the swaps 
as discussed below  we elected to terminate and replace one of the swaps in the first quarter of on september   lehman brothers holdings  inc lhi filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
on october   lehman commercial paper  inc lcpi filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
one of our swaps with a notional amount of million  which expires january   is with lcpi the lehman swap 
as of september  hedge accounting was terminated and all further changes in the fair market value of the lehman swap are being recorded in interest expense and other 
comprehensive income loss related to effective unrealized gains or losses on the fair value of the lehman swap through september  remain in accumulated comprehensive income loss on the balance sheet and will be amortized into interest expense and other as the underlying interest payments are recognized in earnings 
the lehman swap was valued using the income approach with observable level market inputs at the measurement date and standard valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single discounted present amount 
the fair value of the lehman swap at september  was an asset of million  which was adjusted to zero as collectability was deemed uncertain due to the lhi bankruptcy filing 
we included the write down of the asset in interest expense and other for the year ended december  during the first quarter of  we replaced the lehman swap with an interest rate swap agreement which has a notional amount of million the swap replacement and has been designated as a cash flow hedge of variable future cash flows associated with a portion of our long term debt 
under the terms of this agreement  which matured in january  we receive three month libor and pay a fixed rate of 
the net effect of the hedges is to record interest expense at a fixed rate of  as the debt incurs interest based on three month libor plus 
additionally  during the first quarter of  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement which had a notional amount of million to hedge future cash interest payments associated with a portion of our variable rate bank debt the new swap 
under the terms of this agreement  which was to mature in november  we received three month libor and paid a fixed rate of 
the net effect of the hedge was to record interest expense at a fixed rate of  as the debt incurred interest based on three month libor plus we elected to terminate one of the swaps and the new swap in december in connection with entering into the refinance transaction on december  as a result of the refinance transaction  we de designated the swap  the swap replacement and the new swap and hedge accounting was terminated and all further changes in the fair value of the terminated swaps are being recorded in interest expense and other 
comprehensive income loss related to effective unrealized gains or losses on the fair value of the terminated swaps through september  remain in accumulated comprehensive income loss on the balance sheet and will be amortized into interest expense and other as the underlying interest payments are recognized in earnings 
the terminated swaps were valued using the income approach with observable level market inputs at the measurement date and standard valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single discounted present amount 
in the first quarter of  we entered into one interest rate swap agreement the swap and three interest rate cap agreements the caps in order to avoid unplanned volatility in the income statement due to changes in the libor interest rate environment 
the swap  which matured in january  has a notional amount of million and synthetically unwinds the effects of the swap replacement 
the interest rate cap agreements  which mature in february  have a total notional amount of million and were designated as cash flow hedges of future cash interest payments associated with a portion of our variable rate bank debt 
under these arrangements we have purchased a cap on libor at 
the maturities of our long term debt  including interest  future payments under our operating leases and binding equipment purchase commitments as of december  are as follows contractual obligations thereafter total in millions new term loan senior notes equipment loans operating leases letters of credit equipment purchase commitments total contractual obligation payments less amount representing interest present value of future contractual obligations our liability for unrecognized tax benefits of at december  has been omitted from the above table because we cannot determine with certainty when this liability will be settled 
it is reasonably possible that the amount of liability for unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months  however  we do not expect the change will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that  based on current levels of operations  our cash flow from operating activities  together with other available sources of liquidity  including borrowings available under our revolving line of credit  will be sufficient over the next one to two years to fund anticipated capital expenditures and potential acquisitions and make required payments of principal and interest on our debt and other contracts 
under current tax law  we expect to utilize all of our net operating loss carryforwards nols by or  and therefore anticipate being in a tax paying position with respect to a portion of our income in or we may require or choose to obtain additional financing 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend  among other things  on our financial condition and operating performance  as well as the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required  or at all 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity  equity linked or debt securities  those securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock  and our stockholders may experience dilution 
if we need to raise additional funds in the future and are unable to do so or obtain additional financing on acceptable terms in the future  it is possible we would have to limit planned activities or sell assets to obtain liquidity 
we may also from time to time seek to repurchase  redeem  or retire our outstanding indebtedness through cash purchases and exchange offers in open market transactions  privately negotiated purchases or otherwise 
such repurchases  redemptions or retirements  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements and capital resources  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
off balance sheet arrangements see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we periodically enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business 
these are described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is derived directly from healthcare providers and is primarily for imaging services 
to a lesser extent  revenues are generated from direct billings to patients or their medical payors which are recorded net of contractual discounts and other arrangements for providing services at less than established patient billing rates 
revenues from direct patient billing amounted to approximately  and of revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we continuously monitor collections from direct patient billings and compare these collections to revenue  net of contractual discounts  recorded at the time of service 
while such contractual discounts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  an inability to accurately estimate contractual discounts in the future could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
as the price is predetermined  all revenues are recognized at the time the delivery of imaging service has occurred and collectability is reasonably assured  which is based upon contract terms with healthcare providers and negotiated rates with third party payors and patients 
accounts receivable we provide shared and single user diagnostic imaging and radiation oncology equipment and technical support services to the healthcare industry and directly to patients on an outpatient basis 
substantially all of our accounts receivable are due from hospitals  other healthcare providers and health insurance providers located throughout the united states 
services are generally provided pursuant to long term contracts with hospitals and other healthcare providers or directly to patients  and generally collateral is not required 
receivables generally are collected within industry norms for third party payors 
we continuously monitor collections from our clients and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon any specific client collection issues that we have identified and our historical experience 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  an inability to accurately estimate credit losses in the future could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
goodwill and long lived assets asc requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives not be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
in accordance with asc  we have selected to perform an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  using financial information as of september  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such indicators include  but are not limited to  a sustained significant decline in our market capitalization or a significant decline in our expected future cash flows due to changes in company specific factors or the broader business climate 
the evaluation of such factors requires considerable judgment 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are allocated to our four reporting units  which are aggregated into the imaging and radiation oncology segments 
goodwill represented million and million of our million and million of total assets as of december   and  respectively 
imaging segment goodwill totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively and oncology segment goodwill totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we comply with periodic impairment test procedures  as described above 
for each reporting unit  we first compare its estimated fair value with its net book value 
if the estimated fair value exceeds its net book value  goodwill is deemed not to be impaired  and no further testing is necessary 
if the net book value exceeds its estimated fair value  we then perform a second test to calculate the amount of impairment  if any 
to determine the amount of any impairment  we determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
specifically  we determine the fair value of all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including any unrecognized intangible assets  in a hypothetical calculation that yields the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  we record an impairment charge for the difference 
the fair value of a reporting unit is determined using a combination of income and market approaches 
the following describes the valuation methodologies used in  and to derive the estimated fair value of the reporting units 
we use the average of the discounted cash flow dcf method and the guideline public company gpc method in assessing fair value for each reporting unit 
the dcf method involves an analysis of future cash flow projections for the subject reporting unit 
cash flows are discounted at a rate reflective of the perceived risks inherent in the projections 
a terminal value  the estimated value of the entity at the end of the discrete forecast  is calculated by dividing the terminal year net cash flow by an appropriate capitalization rate  which assumes constant growth into perpetuity 
under the gpc method  the fair value of a business is estimated by comparing the subject company to similar companies with publicly traded ownership interests 
from these guideline companies  valuation multiples are derived and then applied to the appropriate operating statistics of the subject company to arrive at indications of value 
we identified six guideline companies for use in our analysis of our reporting units 
for purposes of this analysis  the guideline companies selected represented reasonably similar  but alternative investment opportunities to an investment in the reporting unit 
in and  we concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value  indicating no goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset impairment was present 
following the goodwill assessment  we concluded that the net book values of the radiation oncology reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value 
based on the results of the step test  we recorded an impairment charge of million under asc related to goodwill in the radiation oncology segment 
through december   we have recognized a total of million of goodwill impairment charges 
we also recorded impairment charges of million under asc related to certain certificates of need with indefinite lives  million of which was related to the radiation oncology segment  and million of which was related to the imaging segment 
we applied the income approach to value the certificates of need  utilizing either an excess earnings method or a beneficial earnings method 
under the income approach  value is measured as the present worth of anticipated future net cash flows generated by the asset 
asc also requires intangible assets with definite useful lives to be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment in accordance with asc  property  plant  and equipment 
during the fourth quarter of  based on the factors noted below  we also deemed it appropriate to perform a valuation of certain definite useful lived intangible assets in accordance with asc based on this valuation  we recorded impairment charges of million related to certain physician referral network intangible assets  million of which was related to the radiation oncology segment  and million of which was related to the imaging segment 
we applied the income approach to value the physician referral networks  utilizing the excess earnings method 
lastly  we recorded impairment charges of million under asc  investments equity method and joint ventures related to an other than temporary decline in the fair value of investments in two joint ventures  due to triggering events that occurred in the fourth quarter during the annual budgeting process 
we applied a combination of the dcf and gpc methods  as described above  and the guideline transaction method  for which a value indication is derived from the prices at which companies similar to the subject have been sold  to determine the fair value of these investments 
these impairments reflect how we have been impacted by the reported decline in physician office visits and other conditions in the united states arising from global economic conditions 
due to these factors  we have experienced a decline in demand for our services and a decline in market capitalization 
additionally  the development of new projects  specifically in the radiation oncology segment  has taken longer than expected as the hospital decision making cycle has slowed causing longer than expected negotiation periods  further delaying the regulatory approval cycle and construction timelines 
management remains confident in the long term prospects of both the imaging and radiation oncology segments 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
the three reporting units of the imaging segment that passed the first step of the asc test had estimated fair values that exceeded their net book values by  and  respectively 
the determination of fair value of our reporting units requires significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to  earnings and required capital projections  discount rates  terminal growth rates  and operating income for each reporting unit and the weighting assigned to the results of each of the valuation methods described above 
changes in certain assumptions could have a significant impact on the goodwill impairment assessment 
we evaluated the significant assumptions used to determine the estimated fair values of each reporting unit  both individually and in the aggregate  and concluded they are reasonable 
however  should weak market conditions continue for an extended period or should the operating results of any of our reporting units decline substantially compared to projected results  we could determine that we need to record an impairment charge related to goodwill in our imaging reporting units 
goodwill impairment test the goodwill impairment test has two steps 
step of the test identifies potential impairments at the reporting unit level 
we divide our imaging operations into three geographic regions 
radiation oncology is run as a separate profit center responsible for its own revenue  expenses  and overhead  and is managed on a national basis 
we have aggregated the results of our three imaging reporting units and radiation oncology reporting unit into two reportable segments  imaging and radiation oncology 
for purposes of goodwill impairment testing  we compare the estimated fair value of each of the three imaging reporting units and the radiation oncology reporting unit to its net book value 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its net book value  there is no impairment of goodwill and step is unnecessary 
however  if the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value  then step is failed  and step is performed to determine the amount of the potential impairment 
step utilizes acquisition accounting guidance and requires the fair value calculation of all individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit excluding goodwill  but including any unrecognized intangible assets 
the net fair value of assets less liabilities is then compared to the reporting unit s total estimated fair value as calculated in step the excess of fair value over the net asset value equals the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is then compared to the carrying value of goodwill to determine the reporting unit s goodwill impairment 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
deferred income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
future income tax benefits are recognized only to the extent that the realization of such benefits is considered to be more likely than not 
we regularly review our deferred income tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective income tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to significantly increase our valuation allowance  resulting in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we provide our services exclusively in the united states and receive payment for our services exclusively in united states dollars 
as a result  our financial results are unlikely to be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states  particularly because the majority of our indebtedness has interest rates which are variable 
the recorded carrying amount of our long term debt under our new credit facility approximates fair value as these borrowings have variable rates that reflect currently available terms and conditions for similar debt 
to decrease the risk associated with interest rate increases  we have entered into multiple interest rate swap and collar agreements for a portion of our variable rate debt 
these swaps and collars are designated as cash flow hedges of variable future cash flows associated with our long term debt 
during the first quarter of  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of million each  to hedge future cash interest payments associated with a portion of our variable rate bank debt the swaps 
under the terms of these agreements  we receive three month libor and pay a fixed rate of 
the net effect of the hedges is to record interest expense at a fixed rate of  as the underlying debt incurred interest based on three month libor plus 
for the years ended december  and  we paid net settlement amounts of million and million  respectively  on these swap agreements 
the swaps are three years in length and mature in see below for additional information regarding the swaps 
as discussed below  we elected to terminate and replace one of the swaps in the first quarter of the collar agreements and the swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of variable future cash flows associated with our long term debt 
in accordance with asc  the collars and the swaps are  and will be  recorded at fair value 
on a quarterly basis  the fair value of the collars and swaps will be determined based on quoted market prices and  assuming perfect effectiveness  the difference between the fair value and the book value of the collars will be recognized in comprehensive income  a component of shareholders equity 
on a quarterly basis  the fair value of the swaps will be determined based on the income approach using observable level inputs under asc the fair market value of the swaps will be recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities with all effective changes deferred in comprehensive income

one of our swaps with a notional amount of million  which expires january   is with lcpi the lehman swap 
as of september  hedge accounting was terminated and all further changes in the fair market value of the lehman swap are being recorded in interest expense and other 
comprehensive income loss related to effective unrealized gains or losses on the fair value of the lehman swap through september  remain in accumulated comprehensive income loss on the balance sheet and will be amortized into interest expense and other as the underlying interest payments are recognized in earnings 
the lehman swap was valued using the income approach with observable level market expectations at the measurement date and standard valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single discounted present amount 
the fair market value of the lehman swap at september  was an asset of million  which was adjusted to zero as collectability was deemed uncertain due to the lhi bankruptcy filing 
we included the write down of the asset in interest expense and other for the year ended december  for the last three quarters of  we included million in interest expense and other  net related to the fair value adjustment for this swap as we did not expect lcpi to fulfill their obligations under the swap agreement

for the year ended december   we received net settlement amounts of million on this swap agreement 
the interest rate cap agreements  which mature in february  have a total notional amount of million and were designated as cash flow hedges of future cash interest payments associated with a portion of our variable rate bank debt

the loss would be limited to the amount that would have been received  if any  over the remaining life of the swaps 
on a quarterly basis  the counterparties are evaluated for non performance risk

the collars outstanding at december  matured during january  and all counterparty obligations were met 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states  particularly because the majority of our investments are in cash equivalents
