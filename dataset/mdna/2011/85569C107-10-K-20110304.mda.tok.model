our solutions leverage industry knowledge  best business practices  skilled agents  proven operational excellence and flexible technology 
the startek comprehensive service suite includes customer care  sales support  complex order processing  accounts receivable management  technical and product support and other industry specific processes 
we seek to become a market leader in providing high value bpo services to our clients 
our approach is to develop relationships with our clients that are partnering and collaborative in nature where we are focused  flexible and really listen to their business needs 
in addition we need to deliver creative industry based solutions to meet our clients ever changing business needs 
the end result is the delivery a quality customer experience to our client s customers 
to become a leader in the market  our strategy is to grow our existing client base by deepening and broadening our relationships  add new clients and continue to diversify our client base by entering new vertical markets improve the profitability of our business through an increased percentage of revenues from our offshore operation  operational improvements  increased utilization and right sizing our north american operation  expand our global delivery platform to meet our client needs  broaden our service offerings by providing more innovative and technology enabled solutions  identify prudent acquisitions to expand our business scale and service offerings 
during  we expanded our near shore and offshore delivery platforms by opening a facility in costa rica during the first quarter of and our second facility in the philippines during the second quarter of we believe that diversifying our geographic platform will result in improved margins and position us for future growth 
in addition  in we continued to execute on our site optimization plan whereby we closed two unprofitable canadian facilities and closed four us facilities in order to drive efficiencies and improve margins 
some of these closures were in response to lower client demand  which is discussed further within clients of item of this form k 
we will continue to evaluate the profitability of our north american locations as leases expire  and we will close sites if necessary 
in  we expanded our sales team  signed five new clients many outside our traditional wireless and wireline vertical markets and launched a number of new programs with existing clients 
we continued to invest in technologies to drive efficiencies in our operation and broaden our service offering 
finally  we actively explored business acquisitions that would allow us to accelerate our growth  reduce our client concentration and diversify into new vertical markets 
we operate within three business segments us  canada and offshore 
the business segments align with the regions in which our services are rendered 
as of december   our us segment included the operations of ten facilities in the us  our canada segment included the operations of three facilities in canada  and our offshore segment included the operations of two facilities in the philippines and one in costa rica 
as of december   there were thirteen  five and one facilities in the us  canada and offshore segments  respectively 
as of december   there were thirteen  six and one facilities in the us  canada and offshore segments  respectively 
we use gross profit as our measure of profit and loss for each business segment and do not allocate selling  general and administrative expenses to our business segments 
overall economic conditions have impacted the telecommunications industry and our clients 
we have continued to notice a downturn in this sector which adversely affected our results in the growth in wireless subscribers appears to be slowing  and our clients serving traditional wireline  or landline telephone services  are experiencing decreased demand 
we observed lower call volumes in our north american facilities in from our two largest customers compared to  which adversely affected our results 
however  in  we have seen strong demand for our offshore call center services  primarily in the philippines  which we expect to continue 
in response to overall economic conditions and the industry slowdown  we have observed a greater focus on cutting costs by our customers 
the cost cutting by our customers impacted us during the second quarter of when at t decided to ramp down a majority of its wireline business with us 
approximately full time equivalent agent positions will be eliminated through the first half of as the business declines 
we closed two sites  one in greeley  colorado and one in grand junction  colorado 
agents that serviced other customers or lines of business were relocated to our other facilities in greeley and grand junction 
we have observed that in order to reduce their costs  customers are concentrated on shifting a larger portion of their customer care offshore  increasing their use of outsourced providers and decreasing the number of agents handling calls 
in addition  the telecommunications space continues to shift away from wireline services  to wireless services as many consumers disconnect their home telephone lines in favor of using wireless devices  leading to lower call volumes among wireline clients 
these telecommunications industry trends could adversely impact our financial results in  however  the shift toward outsourced and offshore providers could positively impact our business because of our increased presence in costa rica and the philippines 
given that over of our revenue is concentrated in the telecommunications industry  the speed and intensity in which these trends develop could adversely affect our business 
our strategy includes expanding into other vertical markets  including cable  healthcare  technology and energy  diversifying our client base in order to reduce our exposure to the risks relating to the telecommunications industry  and expanding our offshore platform to keep pace with the anticipated higher demand for those services 
significant developments during the year ended december  new facilities one component of our strategy is to expand our global delivery platform by growing offshore and near shore 
management believes that expansion into international locations will broaden our service delivery platform and build our competitive advantage 
these new facilities are described below 
ortigas  philippines we opened our second facility in the philippines in april management decided to open this facility based upon client demand experienced with our first facility  which opened in we have found that our customers are interested in this lower cost alternative 
the lease has an initial term of five years with a tenant option for an additional five years and is approximately  square feet 
heredia  costa rica we opened our first facility in costa rica in march management chose costa rica for its large  well educated bilingual talent pool and good business climate 
the facility is located in heredia  costa rica and is approximately  square feet 
site closures we endeavor to achieve site optimization at all of our locations by routinely evaluating site performance 
as lease terms expire  or if local economic conditions  prevailing wage rates  or other factors negatively impact the long term financial viability of a location  management will from time to time make the decision to close a facility 
in connection with these site optimization efforts  as well as lower client demand discussed above  management made the decision to close the following sites during laramie  wyoming in january  we closed our facility in laramie  wyoming 
the closure resulted in approximately million less revenue during compared to  and increased gross profit by million  compared to due to negative gross profit at this facility in we have transitioned the work either to startek s home platform  whereby agents work from their homes  or our greeley  colorado facility 
we incurred restructuring and impairment charges of approximately million during the year ended december  we own our facility in laramie  wyoming and have committed to a plan to sell the building in this location 
therefore  we reclassified these long lived assets as current assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet 
victoria  texas in january  we closed our facility in victoria  texas 
the closure was driven by the loss of a client program  resulting from lower call volumes from our second largest client 
the closure resulted in approximately million less revenue during compared to  and increased gross profit by million  compared to  due to negative gross profit at this facility in we incurred restructuring and impairment charges of approximately million during the year ended december  in  we entered into a sublease agreement for this facility through the remainder of the lease term 
thunder bay  ontario in march  we closed our thunder bay  ontario  canada location 
the closure in thunder bay was driven by market conditions  namely recruiting challenges in this location  which negatively impacted the profitability of the location and led to management s determination that it was in our long term interest to close the location 
the closure resulted in approximately million less revenue during compared to  and increased gross profit by million  compared to  due to negative gross profit at this facility in we recorded approximately million in impairment losses in related to assets held at this facility because the carrying value of the assets was not recoverable 
we recorded an offset to restructuring and impairment charges of approximately million in for the reversal of certain deferred rent liabilities  partially offset by additional impairment and restructuring charges 
in  we entered into a sublease agreement for this facility through the remainder of the lease term 
sarnia  ontario in december  we closed our sarnia  ontario location 
the closure was driven by market conditions  namely recruiting challenges in this location  which negatively impacted the profitability of the location and led to management s determination that it was in our long term interest to close the location 
the ramp down of this site during resulted in approximately million less revenue during compared to  and decreased gross profit by million  compared to we recorded approximately million in impairment losses and restructuring charges during the year ended december  greeley  colorado in december  we ramped down one of our greeley  colorado locations 
the closure was driven by the loss of a majority of our wireline business with at t  described above 
agents in this site that serviced other customers or lines of business were relocated to our other facility in greeley  colorado 
the ramp down of this site during resulted in approximately million less revenue during compared to  and decreased gross profit by approximately million  compared to we recorded approximately million in impairment losses and restructuring charges during the year ended december  we own our facility in greeley and have committed to a plan to sell the building in this location

grand junction  colorado in december  we ramped down one of our grand junction  colorado locations 
the closure was driven by the loss of a majority of our wireline business with at t  described above 
agents in this site that serviced other customers or lines of business were relocated to our other facility in grand junction  colorado 
the ramp down of this site during resulted in approximately million less revenue during compared to  and decreased gross profit by million  compared to we recorded approximately million in impairment losses and restructuring charges during the year ended december  other during  we recorded a reduction of restructuring charges in the condensed consolidated statements of operations of million to adjust the estimated restructuring liability for our regina  saskatchewan facility  which closed in february  due to a sublease proposal 
we had previously assumed that we would not be able to sublease the facility 
we also recorded approximately million in impairment losses for assets at other locations in which the future cash flows were less than the carrying value of the assets 
we may make the decision to close certain of these locations  in which case  we may incur restructuring charges in future periods 
other events income tax valuation allowance during we did not record million  or per share  in income tax benefits related to a valuation allowance against us net deferred tax assets 
us gaap requires that we assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against our deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
based on all available evidence  in particular our three year historical cumulative losses  recent operating losses and a us pre tax loss  we recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset 
the recording of a valuation allowance has no impact on cash and does not preclude us from utilizing the full amount of the deferred tax asset in future profitable periods 
subsequent events in february  we closed our facility in alexandria  louisiana due to lower call volumes from our second largest client 
the lease expired in february on march   we reached an agreement with umb bank to amend our line of credit agreement  whereby  the secured line of credit will be reduced from million to million 
under the agreement  our financial covenant to maintain a minimum tangible net worth will be decreased from at least million to at least million 
in addition  borrowings will bear interest at the thirty day libor index plus and shall never be less than per annum 
this is an increase from the previous terms which were that borrowings bore interest  at the option at the time of borrowing  of the thirty  sixty or ninety day libor index  plus and that the interest rate wouldn t be less than per annum 
we expect to finalize this amendment in march and it will be effective through august  results of operations years ended december  and december  due to the february  sale of our subsidiary  domain

the ramp down of these programs resulted in million less revenue in these sites during  compared to we also announced in the fourth quarter that we may close our alexandria  louisiana facility in february due to lower call volumes from our second largest client  the resulting ramp down of this site resulted in million less revenue in  compared to the remaining decrease of million was driven by lower call volumes from our two largest wireless clients and wireline clients 
revenue from canada decreased by million  or 
the decline was driven by the ramp down and closure of three sites in canada regina  saskatchewan in february  thunder bay  ontario in march and sarnia  ontario in december which contributed million less revenue during  compared to the remainder of the decrease in the canadian segment was due to lower north american call volumes from our two largest clients 
offshore revenue increased million from million to million due primarily to two new facilities opened there in in march  we opened our site in costa rica and in april  we opened our second site in the philippines  which combined contributed million in incremental revenue in  compared to the remaining increase was driven by an increase in full time equivalent agents in our other philippine location

cost of services in canada decreased by approximately million  or 
the decrease was driven by a decline of million in  compared to  for the three sites that closed in canada during and  described above 
this decline was partially offset by an increase in cost of services of million due to a weaker us to canadian dollar exchange rate in  compared to these decreases to cost of services were partially offset by greater cost of services in the offshore segment  which increased by approximately million 
the increase was primarily due to higher cost of services associated with our new sites in costa rica and the philippines  which increased cost of services by approximately million  and the ramp up of our makati  philippine location which nearly doubled agent headcount in  compared to selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  from million in to million in as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from in to in selling  general and administrative expenses were higher due to an approximately million increase in base salary expense due in part to the hire of several executives and approximately million in severance expense recorded during the fourth quarter of these increases were partially offset by million from the absence of expenses related to the settlement of a shareholder lawsuit in  and declines of million in hiring expense  million in legal expense  million in contract labor  and million related to payroll processing  personnel expense  consulting fees  training and travel expenses

impairment losses and restructuring charges impairment losses and restructuring charges totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we recorded approximately million in impairment losses during in our canadian segment due to the impairment of certain long lived assets for which the carrying value of those assets is not recoverable

liquidity and capital resources as of december   working capital totaled million and our current ratio was  compared to working capital of million and a current ratio of at december  we have historically financed our operations  liquidity requirements  capital expenditures  and capacity expansion primarily through cash flows from operations  and to a lesser degree  through various forms of debt and leasing arrangements 
in addition to funding basic operations  our primary uses of cash typically relate to capital expenditures to upgrade our existing information technologies and service offerings and investments in our facilities 
we believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by our line of credit will adequately meet our ongoing operating requirements for the next year 
due to the timing of our collections of large billings with our major customers  we have historically needed to draw on our line of credit for ongoing operating activities 
on march   we reached an agreement with umb bank to amend our line of credit agreement  whereby  the amount available on the secured line of credit will be reduced from million to million 
the reduction in the amount available on the line was in response to a modification of certain financial covenants 
during the fourth quarter of  we were out of compliance with our cash flow coverage ratio covenant  which was approximately compared to our requirement of greater than we obtained a waiver of this covenant from umb bank 
as of december   we were in compliance with all other of our debt covenants 
our financial covenant to maintain a minimum tangible net worth will be decreased from at least million to at least million in the new agreement 
in addition  borrowings will bear interest at the thirty day libor index plus and shall never be less than per annum 
this is an increase from the previous terms which were that borrowings bore interest  at our option at the time of the borrowing  of the thirty  sixty or ninety day libor index  plus and that the interest rate wouldn t be less than per annum 
we expect to finalize this amendment in march and it will be effective through august  we do not expect the decline in the amount available on the line to significantly impact our liquidity 
during  the cumulative borrowings on our line of credit were approximately million 
we do not anticipate the need to place substantially more reliance on the line of credit during there was no balance outstanding on the line of credit as of december  any significant future expansion of our business may require us to secure additional cash resources 
if we enter into an acquisition  it may require us to use our cash  draw on our line of credit or obtain additional financing  which could decrease cash available for operations 
in addition  a decrease in demand for our services  particularly from any of our principal clients  which could arise from a number of factors  including  but not limited to  competitive pressures  adverse trends in the business process outsourcing market  industry consolidation  adverse circumstances with respect to the industries we service  and any of the other factors we describe more fully in item a
