our best estimate is based on assumptions about launch dates  volumes and renewal rates within the three year period 
most of these contracts are priced by volume of usage and typically have no or low minimum commitments 
actual revenue could vary from our estimates due to factors such as cancellations  non renewals or volume fluctuations

credit facilities and debt convertible debentures we have million of convertible senior debentures due in the debentures that were issued on august  in a private placement to citigroup global markets inc and goldman  sachs co 
the debentures bear an interest rate of per annum  payable semi annually in arrears beginning on february   and mature on august  subject to the right of the holders of the debentures to require us to redeem the debentures on august   and the related debt discount and debt issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method through august the debentures are general senior unsecured obligations  ranking equally in right of payment to all of our existing and future unsecured  unsubordinated indebtedness and senior in right of payment to any indebtedness that is contractually subordinated to the debentures 
the debentures are effectively subordinated to our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness and are structurally subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries

if the conversion triggers were met  we could be required to repay all or some of the principal amount in cash prior to the maturity date 

table of contents credit facility we have a credit facility which consists of a million revolving credit line including letters of credit  a million term loan entered into on march   a million term loan entered into on april  and a million term loan entered into on august  the credit facility 
in july  we entered into agreements to amend and restate our existing credit facility 
of the approximately million remaining term loan  lenders representing million elected to extend the maturity date by three years to march  the remaining million in term loans are due march in addition  lenders participating in the revolving credit facility have chosen to extend the maturity date by three years to march  as of september   million remained outstanding under the term loans  there were million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit line and there were no other outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit line 
the credit facility contains covenants  including  among other things  covenants that restrict our ability and those of our subsidiaries to incur certain additional indebtedness  create or permit liens on assets  enter into sale leaseback transactions  make loans or investments  sell assets  make certain acquisitions  pay dividends  or repurchase stock 
the agreement also contains events of default  including failure to make payments of principal or interest  failure to observe covenants  breaches of representations and warranties  defaults under certain other material indebtedness  failure to satisfy material judgments  a change of control and certain insolvency events 
as of september   we were in compliance with the covenants under the credit facility

we capitalized debt issuance costs related to the credit facility and are amortizing the costs to interest expense using the effective interest rate method through march for costs associated with the unextended portion of the term loan  through march for costs associated with the revolving credit facility and march for the remainder of the balance 
as of september  and  the ending unamortized deferred financing fees were million and million  respectively  and are included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the credit facility amendment extended the payment terms on a portion of the loan 
principal is due in quarterly installments of of the then outstanding balance through the original maturity date of march for million  representing the portion of the loan that was not extended 
principal payments on the extended loan of are due in quarterly installments of of the then outstanding balance through march  at which point the remaining balance becomes due 
in addition  an annual excess cash flow sweep  as defined in the credit facility  is payable in the first quarter of each fiscal year  based on the excess cash flow generated in the previous fiscal year 
we have not generated excess cash flows in any period and no additional payments are required 
we will continue to 
table of contents evaluate the extent to which a payment is due in the first quarter of future fiscal years based on excess cash flow generation 
at the current time  we are unable to predict the amount of the outstanding principal  if any  that may be required to be repaid in future fiscal years pursuant to the excess cash flow sweep provisions 
any term loan borrowings not paid through the baseline repayment  the excess cash flow sweep  or any other mandatory or optional payments that we may make  will be repaid upon maturity 
if only the baseline repayments are made  the annual aggregate principal amount of the term loans repaid would be as follows dollars in thousands year ending september  amount total our obligations under the credit facility are unconditionally guaranteed by  subject to certain exceptions  each of our existing and future direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries 
the credit facility and the guarantees thereof are secured by first priority liens and security interests in the following of the capital stock of substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries and of the outstanding voting equity interests and of the non voting equity interests of first tier foreign subsidiaries  all our material tangible and intangible assets and those of the guarantors  and any present and future intercompany debt 
the credit facility also contains provisions for mandatory prepayments of outstanding term loans upon receipt of the following  and subject to certain exceptions of net cash proceeds from asset sales  of net cash proceeds from issuance or incurrence of debt  and of extraordinary receipts 
we may voluntarily prepay borrowings under the credit facility without premium or penalty other than breakage costs  as defined with respect to libor based loans 
the debentures provide the holders with the right to convert the debt to shares of our common stock under certain specified conditions  including triggers related to our share price 
if the closing share price of our stock exceeds of the initial conversion price of approximately for the periods defined in the agreement  the holders have the right to convert the debentures 
our stock price has been trading above per share for extended periods beginning in october  and therefore it is possible that the holders of the debentures will have the right to convert their holdings at some point during fiscal if the holders make this election  the principal amount of the debentures is payable in cash and any amounts payable in excess of the million principal amount will be paid in cash or shares of our common stock  at our election 
given that the debentures are traded in a secondary market and the current market value of the debentures exceeds the value that the holders would receive upon conversion  we believe that the holders may not have a significant economic incentive to exercise their conversion option prior to august we believe that cash flows from future operations in addition to cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand will be sufficient to meet our working capital  investing  financing and contractual obligations and the contingent payments for acquisitions  if any are realized  as they become due for at least the next twelve months 
we also believe that in the event future operating results are not as planned  that we could take actions  including restructuring actions and other cost reduction initiatives  to reduce operating expenses to levels which  in combination with expected future revenue  will continue to generate sufficient operating cash flow 
in the event that these actions are not effective in generating operating cash flows we may be required to issue equity or debt securities on terms that may be less favorable

total sublease income under contractual terms is expected to be million  which ranges from million to million on an annualized basis through the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of september  was million 
we do not expect a significant change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next months 
we estimate that none of 
table of contents this amount will be paid within the next year and we are currently unable to reasonably estimate the timing of payments for the remainder of the liability 
contingent liabilities and commitments in connection with certain of our acquisitions  we have agreed to make contingent cash payments to the former shareholders of certain of the acquired companies 
the following represents the contingent cash payments that we may be required to make 
in connection with our acquisition of snapin software  inc snapin  we agreed to make a contingent earn out payment of up to million in cash to be paid  if at all  based on the business achieving certain performance targets that are measurable from the acquisition date to december  in april  the company and the former shareholders of snapin agreed on a final earn out payment of million and we issued  shares of our common stock  valued at million  as our first payment under the earn out agreement 
the remaining balance of million was paid in cash in october  and is included in short term liabilities as of september  in connection with our acquisition of vocada  inc vocada  we agreed to make contingent earn out payments of up to million  payable in stock  or cash  solely at our discretion  upon the achievement of certain financial targets measured over defined periods through december  we have notified the former shareholders of vocada that the financial targets for all periods were not achieved 
in december  the former shareholders filed a demand for arbitration in accordance with their rights under the merger agreement 
as of september   we have not recorded any obligation relative to these earn out provisions 
financial instruments we use financial instruments to manage our foreign exchange risk 
we follow financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification asc  derivatives and hedging  for our derivative instruments 
we operate our business in countries throughout the world and transact business in various foreign currencies 
our foreign currency exposures typically arise from transactions denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency of our operations 
during fiscal  we commenced a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
we established this program so that gains and losses from remeasurement or settlement of these assets and liabilities are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts thus mitigating the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions 
generally  we enter into contracts with terms of days or less  and at september  we had outstanding contracts with a total notional value of million 
from time to time we will enter into agreements that allow us to issue shares of our common stock as part or all of the consideration related to partnering and technology acquisition activities 
generally these shares are issued subject to security price guarantees which are accounted for as derivatives 
we have determined that these instruments would not be considered equity instruments if they were freestanding 
the security price guarantees require payment from either us to the third party  or from the third party to us  based upon the difference between the price of our common stock on the issue date and an average price of our common stock approximately six months following the issue date 
changes in the fair value of these security price guarantees are reported in earnings in each period as non operating income expense with other income  net 
during the year ended september  and  we recorded million and million  respectively of gains associated with these contracts and received cash payments totaling million and million  respectively  upon to settlement of the agreements during the year 
pension plans we assumed the assets and obligations related to certain defined benefit pension plans in connection with our acquisition of dictaphone  which provide certain retirement and death benefits for former dictaphone employees located in the united kingdom and canada 
these two pension plans are closed to new participants 
these plans 
table of contents require periodic cash contributions

for the uk pension plan  we have a minimum funding requirement of  approximately million based on the exchange rate at september  for each of the next three years  through fiscal in connection with our acquisition of svox ag in june  we assumed an additional defined benefit pension plan for employees in switzerland 
at the end of september   the plan benefit obligations exceed the plan assets by approximately million

company contributions in fiscal are expected to be million 
off balance sheet arrangements through september   we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements or material transactions with unconsolidated entities or other persons 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  assumptions and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and returns  the valuation of goodwill  intangible assets and tangible long lived assets  accounting for business combinations  accounting for stock based compensation  accounting for derivative instruments  accounting for income taxes and related valuation allowances  and loss contingencies 
our management bases its estimates on historical experience  market participant fair value considerations and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies most significantly affect the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult and subjective judgments 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue from the following sources software license agreements  including royalty and other usage based arrangements  post contract customer support  fixed and variable fee hosting arrangements and professional services 
our revenue recognition policies for these revenue streams are discussed below 
the sale and or license of software products and technology is deemed to have occurred when a customer either has taken possession of the related software or technology or has access to take immediate possession of the software or technology 
in select situations  we sell or license intellectual property in conjunction with  or in place of  embedding our intellectual property in software 
we recognize revenue from the sale or license of software products and licensing of technology when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the fee is fixed or determinable and iv collectibility is probable 
vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for software and software related services exists when a company can support what the fair value of its software and or software related services is based on evidence of the prices charged by the company when the same elements are sold separately 
vsoe of fair value is required  generally  in order to separate the accounting for various elements in a software and related services arrangement 
we have  in general  established vsoe of fair value of our post contract customer support pcs  professional services  and training 
revenue from royalties on sales of our software products by original equipment manufacturers oems  where no services are included  is recognized in the quarter earned so long as we have been notified by the oem that such royalties are due  and provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
software arrangements generally include pcs  which includes telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades enhancements on a when and if available basis  typically for one to five years 
revenue from pcs is recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the term that the maintenance service is provided 

table of contents non software revenue  such as arrangements containing hosting services where the customer does not take possession of the software at the outset of the arrangement and has no contractual right to do so  is recognized when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the fees are fixed or determinable and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
for revenue arrangements with multiple elements that are not considered to be software or software related  we allocate an arrangement s fees into separate units of accounting based on fair value 
we generally support fair value of our deliverables based upon the prices we charge when we sell similar elements separately 
revenue from products offered on a subscription and or hosted  on demand basis is recognized in the period the services are provided  based on a fixed minimum fee and or variable fees based on the volume of activity 
variable subscription and hosting revenue is recognized as we are notified by the customer or through management reports that such revenue is due  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
set up fees from arrangements containing hosting services  as well as the associated direct and incremental costs  are deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the contractual lives  or the expected lives of the customer relationships 
when we provide professional services considered essential to the functionality of the software  we recognize revenue from the professional services as well as any related software licenses on a percentage of completion basis whereby the arrangement consideration is recognized as the services are performed as measured by an observable input 
in these circumstances  we separate license revenue from professional service revenue for income statement presentation by allocating vsoe of fair value of the professional services as professional service revenue and the residual portion as license revenue 
we generally determine the percentage of completion by comparing the labor hours incurred to date to the estimated total labor hours required to complete the project 
we consider labor hours to be the most reliable  available measure of progress on these projects 
adjustments to estimates to complete are made in the periods in which facts resulting in a change become known 
when the estimate indicates that a loss will be incurred  such loss is recorded in the period identified 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the percent complete of each contract 
different assumptions could yield materially different results 
when products are sold through distributors or resellers  title and risk of loss generally passes upon shipment  at which time the transaction is invoiced and payment is due 
shipments to distributors and resellers without right of return are recognized as revenue upon shipment  provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
certain distributors and value added resellers have been granted rights of return for as long as the distributors or resellers hold the inventory 
we cannot estimate historical returns from these distributors and resellers  and therefore  cannot use such estimates as the basis upon which to estimate future sales returns 
as a result  we recognize revenue from sales to these distributors and resellers when the products are sold through to retailers and end users 
when products are sold directly to retailers or end users  we make an estimate of sales returns based on historical experience 
the provision for these estimated returns is recorded as a reduction of revenue and accounts receivable at the time that the related revenue is recorded 
if actual returns differ significantly from our estimates  such differences could have a material impact on our results of operations for the period in which the actual returns become known 
when maintenance and support contracts renew automatically  we provide a reserve based on historical experience for contracts expected to be cancelled for non payment 
all known and estimated cancellations are recorded as a reduction to revenue and accounts receivable 
we record consideration given to a reseller as a reduction of revenue to the extent we have recorded cumulative revenue from the customer or reseller 
however  when we receive an identifiable benefit in exchange for the consideration  and can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received  the consideration is recorded as an operating expense 
we record reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses as revenue  with offsetting costs recorded as cost of revenue 
out of pocket expenses generally include  but are not limited to  expenses related to transportation  lodging and meals 

table of contents we record shipping and handling costs billed to customers as revenue with offsetting costs recorded as cost of revenue 
our revenue recognition policies require management to make significant estimates 
management analyzes various factors  including a review of specific transactions  historical experience  creditworthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions 
changes in judgments based upon these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue and cost recognized and thus affects our results of operations and financial condition 
business combinations 
we determine and allocate the purchase price of an acquired company to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the business combination date 
the purchase price allocation process requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions  including fair value estimates  as of the business acquisition date  including estimated fair values of intangible assets  estimated fair market values of legal performance commitments to customers  assumed from the acquiree under existing contractual obligations classified as deferred revenue at the date of acquisition  estimated fair market values of stock awards assumed from the acquiree that are included in the purchase price  estimated fair market value of required payments under contingent consideration provisions  estimated income tax assets and liabilities assumed from the acquiree  and estimated fair value of pre acquisition contingencies assumed from the acquiree 
while we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the business combination date  our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement 
as a result  during the purchase price allocation period  which is generally one year from the business combination date  we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  with the corresponding offset to goodwill 
subsequent to the purchase price allocation period any adjustment to assets acquired or liabilities assumed is included in operating results in the period in which the adjustment is determined 
for changes in the valuation of intangible assets between preliminary and final purchase price allocation  the related amortization is adjusted on a prospective basis 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from software license sales  support agreements  consulting contracts  other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop in process research and development projects into commercially viable products and the estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand and competitive position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
in connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions  we estimate the fair market value of legal performance commitments to customers  which are classified as deferred revenue 
the estimated fair market value of these obligations is determined and recorded as of the acquisition date 
for a given acquisition  we may identify certain pre acquisition contingencies 
if  during the purchase price allocation period  we are able to determine the fair value of a pre acquisition contingency  we will include that 
table of contents amount in the purchase price allocation 
if we are unable to determine the fair value of a pre acquisition contingency at the end of the purchase price allocation period  we will evaluate whether to include an amount in the purchase price allocation based on whether it is probable a liability had been incurred and whether an amount can be reasonably estimated 
after the end of the purchase price allocation period  any adjustment to amounts recorded for a pre acquisition contingency will be included in our operating results in the period in which the adjustment is determined 
goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets and impairment assessments 
we have significant long lived tangible and intangible assets  including goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  which are susceptible to valuation adjustments as a result of changes in various factors or conditions 
the most significant finite lived tangible and intangible assets are customer relationships  licensed technology  patents and core technology  completed technology  fixed assets and trade names 
all finite lived intangible assets are amortized based upon patterns in which the economic benefits are expected to be utilized 
the values of intangible assets determined in connection with a business combination  with the exception of goodwill  were initially determined by a risk adjusted  discounted cash flow approach 
we assess the potential impairment of intangible and fixed assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for potential impairment at least annually  but also whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment of such assets  include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and a decline in our market capitalization below net book value 
future adverse changes in these or other unforeseeable factors could result in an impairment charge that would materially impact future results of operations and financial position in the reporting period identified 
we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually in the fourth quarter  and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives compares the fair value of identified reporting unit s to its their carrying amount to assess whether such assets are impaired 
as a result of the change in our reportable segments in fiscal  we now have seven reporting units based on the level of information provided to  and review thereof  by our management 
we determine fair values for each of the reporting units using an income approach 
when available and appropriate  we also use a comparative market approach to derive the fair values 
for purposes of the income approach  fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows  discounted at an appropriate risk adjusted rate 
we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of long term future growth rates based on our most recent views of the long term outlook for each business 
actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts 
we derive our discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to our reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing 
we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts 
discount rates used in our reporting unit valuations ranged from to 
for purposes of the market approach  we use a valuation technique in which values are derived based on market prices of comparable publicly traded companies 
we also use a market based valuation technique in which values are determined based on relevant observable information generated by market transactions involving comparable businesses 
compared to the market approach  the income approach more closely aligns each reporting unit valuation to our business profile  including geographic markets served and product offerings 
required rates of return  along with uncertainty inherent in the forecasts of future cash flows  are reflected in the selection of the discount rate 
equally important  under this approach  reasonably likely scenarios and associated sensitivities can be developed for alternative future states that may not be reflected in an observable market price 
a market approach allows for comparison to actual market transactions and multiples 
it can be somewhat more limited in its 
table of contents application because the population of potential comparables is often limited to publicly traded companies where the characteristics of the comparative business and ours can be significantly different  market data is usually not available for divisions within larger conglomerates or non public subsidiaries that could otherwise qualify as comparable  and the specific circumstances surrounding a market transaction eg  synergies between the parties  terms and conditions of the transaction  etc 
may be different or irrelevant with respect to our business 
it can also be difficult  under certain market conditions  to identify orderly transactions between market participants in similar businesses 
we assess each valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation and weight the methodologies appropriately 
the carrying values of the reporting units were determined based on an allocation of our assets and liabilities through specific allocation of certain assets and liabilities  to the reporting units and an apportionment method based on relative size of the reporting units revenues and operating expenses compared to the company as a whole 
goodwill was allocated to the new reporting units based on the relative fair value of the affected units at the date we implemented the new structure 
certain corporate assets that are not instrumental to the reporting units operations and would not be transferred to hypothetical purchasers of the reporting units were excluded from the reporting units carrying values 
based on our assessments  we have not had any impairment charges during our history as a result of our impairment evaluation of goodwill 
significant adverse changes in our future revenues and or adjusted ebitda results  or significant degradation in the enterprise values of comparable companies within our segments  could result in the determination that all or a portion of our goodwill is impaired 
however  as of our fiscal annual impairment assessment date  our estimated fair values of our reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values 
we periodically review long lived assets other than goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of those assets are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded carrying value for the asset or asset group 
asset groups utilized in this analysis are identified as the lowest level grouping of assets for which largely independent cash flows can be identified 
if impairment is indicated  the asset or asset group is written down to its estimated fair value 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the useful lives of our long lived assets  determining the reporting units and assessing when events or circumstances would require an interim impairment analysis of goodwill or other long lived assets to be performed 
changes in our organization or management reporting structure  as well as other events and circumstances  including but not limited to technological advances  increased competition and changing economic or market conditions  could result in a shorter estimated useful lives  b changes to reporting units  which may require alternative methods of estimating fair values or greater disaggregation or aggregation in our analysis by reporting unit  and or c other changes in previous assumptions or estimates 
in turn  this could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements through accelerated amortization and or impairment charges 
accounting for stock based compensation 
we account for share based awards to employees and directors  including grants of employee stock options  purchases under employee stock purchase plans  awards in the form of restricted shares restricted stock and awards in the form of units of stock purchase rights restricted units through recognition of the fair value of the share based awards as a charge against earnings in the form of stock based compensation expense 
we recognize stock based compensation expense over the requisite service period  net of estimated forfeitures 
we will recognize a benefit from stock based compensation in equity using the with and without approach for the utilization of tax attributes 
the restricted stock and restricted units are collectively referred to as restricted awards 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating expected dividends  share price volatility and the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences 
table of contents are expected to reverse 
we do not provide for us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  which we consider to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the us we make judgments regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
the balance sheet carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on whether we believe that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets after consideration of all available evidence 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
valuation allowances have been established for us and certain foreign deferred tax assets  which we believe do not meet the more likely than not criteria for recognition 
if we are subsequently able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been established  then we may be required to recognize these deferred tax assets through the reduction of the valuation allowance which could result in a material benefit to our results of operations in the period in which the benefit is determined  excluding the recognition of the portion of the valuation allowance which relates to net deferred tax assets created as a result of stock based compensation or other equity transactions where prevailing guidance requires the change in valuation allowance to be traced forward 
the recognition of the portion of the valuation allowance which relates to net deferred tax assets resulting from stock based compensation or other qualifying equity transactions will be recorded as additional paid in capital 
we establish reserves for tax uncertainties that reflect the use of the comprehensive model for the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions 
under the comprehensive model  when the minimum threshold for recognition is not met  no tax benefit can be recorded 
when the minimum threshold for recognition is met  a tax position is recorded as the largest amount that is more than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
loss contingencies 
we are subject to legal proceedings  lawsuits and other claims relating to labor  service and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business  as discussed in note of notes to our consolidated financial statements 
quarterly  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income 
this asu intends to enhance comparability and transparency of other comprehensive income components 
the guidance provides an option to present total comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income in a single continuous statement or two separate but consecutive statements 
this asu eliminates the option to present other comprehensive income components as part of the statement of changes in shareowners equity 
the provisions of this asu will be applied retrospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after december  early application is permitted 
asu impacts disclosure only and therefore  is not expected to  have a material impact on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards  to provide consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
asu changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements  particularly for level fair value measurements as defined in note of notes to our consolidated financial statements 
asu is effective for periods beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact on our fair value measures 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations  to provide guidelines for how pro forma disclosures are calculated 
in addition  asu expands the disclosure requirements and requires a description of the nature and amount of any material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to a business combination and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  asu impacts disclosure only and therefore  did not  and is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and amends the criteria for performing step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts and requires performing step if qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
we do not believe that this will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 improving disclosures about fair value measurements topic fair value measurements and disclosures asu  which requires additional disclosures about the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value  the valuation techniques and inputs used  the activity in level fair value measurements  and transfers between levels   and levels  and of fair value measurements are defined in note of notes to our consolidated financial statements 
asu was effective for us for the interim reporting period beginning january   except for the provisions related to activity in level fair value measurements 
those provisions are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
asu impacts disclosure only and therefore  did not  and is not expected to  have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and equity prices which could affect operating results  financial position and cash flows 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and  when appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
exchange rate sensitivity we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
any foreign currency transaction  defined as a transaction denominated in a currency other than the us dollar  will be reported in us dollars at the applicable exchange rate 
assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense items are translated at average rates for the period 
the primary foreign currency denominated transactions include revenue and expenses and the resulting accounts receivable and accounts payable balances reflected on our balance sheet 
therefore  the change in the value of the us dollar compared to foreign currencies will have either a positive or negative effect on our financial position and results of operations 
historically  our primary exposure has related to transactions denominated in the euro  british pound  canadian dollar  japanese yen  indian rupee and hungarian forint 
a hypothetical change of in appreciation or depreciation in foreign currency exchange rates from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at september  would not have a material impact on our revenue  operating results or cash flows in the coming year 
periodically  we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
these contracts may or may not be designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
at september   we have foreign currency contracts with a total notional value of approximately million designated as cash flow hedges 
these contracts all mature in october the notional contract amount of outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts not designated as cash flow hedges was million at september  during fiscal and  we recorded foreign exchange loss of million and a gain of million  respectively 
based on the nature of the transaction for which the contracts were purchased  a hypothetical change of in exchange rates would not have a material impact on our financial results 

table of contents interest rate sensitivity we are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our significant cash and cash equivalents  and the outstanding debt under the credit facility 
at september   we held approximately million of cash and cash equivalents primarily consisting of cash and money market funds 
due to the low current market yields and the short term nature of our investments  a hypothetical change in market rates of one percentage point would not have a material effect on the fair value of our portfolio or results of operations 
at september   our total outstanding debt balance exposed to variable interest rates was million 
a hypothetical change in market rates would have a significant impact on interest expense and amounts payable 
assuming a one percentage point increase in interest rates  our interest expense relative to our outstanding variable rate debt would increase million per annum 
equity price risk we are exposed to equity price risk as a result of security price guarantees that we enter in to from time to time 
generally  these price guarantees are for a period of six months or less  and require payment from either us to a third party  or from the third party to us  based upon changes in our stock price during the contract term 
as of september   we have security price guarantees outstanding for approximately million shares of our common stock 
a change in our stock price during the next six months would not have a material impact on our statements of operations or cash flows 
convertible debentures the fair value of our convertible debentures due in is dependent on the price and volatility of our common stock as well as movements in interest rates 
the fair market value of the debentures will generally increase or decrease as the market price of our common stock changes 
the fair market value of the debentures will generally increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the market value and interest rate changes affect the fair market value of the debentures  but do not impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations 
however  increases in the value of our common stock above for a specified period of time may provide the holders of the debentures the right to convert each bond using a conversion ratio and payment method as defined in the debenture agreement 
our debentures trade in the financial markets  and the fair value at september  was million  based on an average of the bid and ask prices for that day 
this compares to a conversion value on september  of approximately million 
a increase in the stock price over the september  closing price of would have an estimated million increase to the fair value and a million increase to the conversion value of the debentures 
given the current trading value of the debentures  the greatest value to the holders of the debentures would be to sell their holding in the open market in order to maximize their return 
based on this  we believe that the holders may not have a significant economic incentive to convert prior to the first redemption date in august
