restatement of previously issued financial statements in march and april  after discussions with management and our independent registered public accounting firm  the audit committee of the board the audit committee recommended to the board  and the board thereafter concluded  that our previously issued consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and  including the quarterly periods be restated

background and overview our primary focus is to provide real time systems solutions  including equipment and software  and services to our customers in the areas of hydrological  meteorological and oceanic monitoring 
we design  manufacture and market these products and services to a diversified customer base consisting of federal  state  local and foreign governments  engineering companies  universities and hydropower companies 
our products and services enable these entities to monitor and collect hydrological  meteorological and oceanic data for the management of critical water resources  for early warning of potentially disastrous floods  storms or tsunamis  for the optimization of hydropower plants and for providing real time weather conditions at airports 
our key products are the satlink transmitter logger  the xpert xlite dataloggers  the accububble self contained bubbler  the accubar pressure sensor  and tempest and xconnect systems software 
these are the essential components of most systems and are provided to customers as off the shelf equipment or as part of a custom system 
the satlink is a key product because it functions both as a transmitter and logger 
the xpert and xlite are more powerful dataloggers that have significant more logging capability and communications options than the satlink our tempest and xconnect systems software allow us to provide turn key systems solutions to our customers 
we are beginning fiscal year with a backlog of approximately  as compared to beginning fiscal year with a backlog of approximately  we estimate that approximately of our december  backlog will convert to revenue in we anticipate that we will continue to experience significant quarterly fluctuations in our sales and revenues in operating results will depend upon the product mix and upon the timing of project awards 
international sales  which totaled of revenues for  are a significant portion of our revenues 
we believe that international revenues will grow as a percentage of our total business as we plan to develop stronger international partnerships and expand our international sales opportunities 
international sales are however difficult to forecast because they are frequently delayed due to the different governmental procurement and approval processes 
our domestic business is highly dependent upon government business 
contracts and purchase orders with federal  state and local government agencies represented approximately of our revenues 
we are committed in our ongoing sales  marketing and research and development activities to sustain and grow our sales and revenues from our products and services 
we expect our sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses to increase moderately in as compared to due to planned spending on sales and marketing activities and on new products and applications 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate  on an on going basis  our estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  excess and obsolete inventories  warranty obligations  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
our estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  allowances for excess and obsolete inventories  accounting for warranty obligations  accounting for income taxes  accounting and valuation of stock option compensation 
revenue recognition revenue for our products  consisting of both equipment and software  is recognized upon shipment  delivery  installation or customer acceptance of the product  as agreed in the customer order or contract 
we do sell our software products without the related equipment although software products are integral to systems 
our typical system requires no significant production  modification or customization of the software or hardware 
for complex systems  revenue is deferred until customer acceptance 
we do provide customer discounts and do allow for product returns 
we do not do consignment sales or bill and hold 
revenue reflects reductions due to discounts and product returns 
product returns have historically been insignificant in amount 
our sales arrangements for systems often include services in addition to equipment and software 
these services could include equipment integration  software customization  installation  maintenance  training  and customer support 
for sales arrangements that include bundled hardware  software and services  we account for any undelivered service offering as a separate element of a multiple element arrangement 
amounts allocated to each element are based on its objectively determined fair value  such as the sales price for the product or service when it is sold separately 
revenue for these services is typically recognized ratably over the period benefited or when the services are complete 
we use the percentage of completion method for recognizing revenue and profits when we perform on fixed price contracts that extend over a number of years 
under the percentage of completion method  revenue and profits are recorded as costs are incurred based on estimates of total sales value and costs at completion where total profit can be estimated with reasonable accuracy and ultimate realization is reasonably assured 
profit estimates are revised periodically based upon changes and facts  and any losses on contracts are recognized immediately 
contracts may contain provisions to earn incentive and award fees if targets are achieved 
incentive and award fees that can be reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract 
incentive and award fees that cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded 
we recognize revenue from time and materials contracts to the extent of billable rates  times hours delivered  plus direct materials costs incurred 
some of the contracts include provisions to withhold a portion of the contract value as retainage 
our policy is to take into revenue the full value of the contract  including any retainage  as we perform against the contract 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable arise from the normal course of selling products on credit to customers 
an allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided for estimated uncollectable accounts 
accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms and practices are analyzed when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
individual accounts are charged against the allowance when collection efforts have been exhausted 
inventory valuation ur inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we provide allowances on inventories for any material that has become obsolete or may become unsalable based on estimates of future demand and sale price in the market 
judgments with respect to salability and usage of inventories  estimated market value  and recoverability upon sale are complex and subjective 
such assumptions are reviewed periodically and adjustments are made  as necessary  to reflect changed conditions 
warranty obligations we warranty our products for up to two years and estimated warranty costs are based upon management s best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on equipment sold as of the balance sheet date 
factors considered include actual past experience of product returns and the related estimated cost of labor and material to make the necessary repairs as well as technological advances and enhanced design and manufacturing processes 
if actual future product return rates or the actual costs of material and labor differ from the estimates  adjustments to the accrued warranty liability are made 
income taxes we are taxed as a domestic us corporation under the internal revenue code 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are evaluated and a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the tax asset will not be utilized 
stock option compensation we adopted the provisions of fasb asc compensation stock compensation on january   which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
additionally  the corporation follows the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin share based payment which provides supplemental asc application guidance based on the views of the sec
