overview our company we are the largest producer of muriate of potash potassium chloride or potash in the united states and are dedicated to the production and marketing of potash and langbeinite sulfate of potash magnesia  another mineral containing potassium that is produced from langbeinite ore and which we will generally describe as langbeinite when we refer to production and as trio when we refer to sales and marketing 
our revenues are generated exclusively from the sale of potash and trio 
potassium is one of the three primary nutrients essential to plant formation and growth 
since  we have supplied  on average  approximately percent of world potassium consumption and percent of annual us consumption 
we are one of two producers of sulfate of potash magnesia  a low chloride potassium fertilizer with the additional benefits of sulfur and magnesium  providing a multi nutrient product 
we also produce salt  magnesium chloride  and metal recovery salts from our potash mining processes  the sales of which are accounted for as by product credits to our cost of sales 
our potash is marketed for sale into three primary markets  agricultural market as fertilizer  industrial market as a component in drilling and fracturing fluids for oil and gas wells  and animal feed market as a nutrient 
our primary regional markets include agricultural areas and feed manufacturers west of the mississippi river  as well as oil and gas drilling areas in the rocky mountains and the permian basin 
we also have sales that go into the southeastern and eastern united states  but on a smaller scale 
our potash production has a geographic concentration in the western united states and is therefore affected by weather and other conditions in this region 
we own five active potash production facilities three in new mexico referenced collectively below as carlsbad or individually as west  east  and north and two in utah moab and wendover and we have a current estimated productive capacity to produce approximately  tons of potash and approximately  tons of langbeinite annually 
productive capacity is affected by operating rates  recoveries  mining rates and the amount of development work that we do and  
table of contents therefore  our production results tend to be lower than our productive capacity 
we are actively developing the hb solar solution mine  located adjacent to our existing producing assets near carlsbad  new mexico  which is an idled potash mine that we are in the process of reopening as a solution mine that will utilize solar evaporation techniques in the production of potash 
we also have additional opportunities to develop mineralized deposits of potash in new mexico which could include the reopening of the north mine  which was operated as a traditional underground mine until the early s  as well as the acceleration of production from our reserves and mineralized deposits of potash through new access points in the area and the potential construction of additional production facilities in the region 
our asset base was built through the acquisition of the moab operations in  and then the wendover and carlsbad operations in we assembled these assets after observing that the moab mine sold potash into the same geographic regions as the carlsbad  new mexico and wendover  utah mines 
we recognized that acquiring assets in those areas could allow for consolidated marketing efforts and effect operating synergies 
from the inception of mining in january to december   we have made capital investments in these mines to improve their reliability and the efficiencies of the mining operations 
intrepid was incorporated in the state of delaware on november   for the purpose of continuing the business of mining in corporate form after intrepid ipo 
on april   intrepid closed its ipo by selling  shares of common stock at per share 
net proceeds of the offering were approximately billion after underwriting discounts and commissions and transaction costs 
prior to april   intrepid was a consolidated subsidiary of mining  its predecessor 
since april   mining ongoing business has been conducted by intrepid and includes all operations that previously had been conducted by mining 
on april   pursuant to an exchange agreement exchange agreement  mining assigned all of its assets other than approximately million of its cash to intrepid in exchange for  shares of intrepid common stock and approximately million of the net proceeds of the ipo 
in connection with the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option  intrepid also distributed to mining approximately million on april   referred to as the formation distribution 
the ipo  the transactions under the exchange agreement  and the formation distribution are referred to collectively as the formation transactions 
presentation of information the activity presented in all periods on or after april   is for intrepid while all periods presented prior to april   relate to mining as the predecessor entity 
the results of operations data for the years ended december   and december   the period from april   through december   and the balance sheet data as of december   and  presented herein  were derived from the consolidated financial results of intrepid 
the results of operations data for the period from january   through april  the predecessor period  presented herein  were derived from the historical financial statements of mining 
the financial statements for the predecessor period give effect to identified revenues  estimated expenses  discrete events  substantiation of assets and liabilities and other methods management considered to provide a reasonable reflection of the results for such period 
the historical financial data of mining may not be indicative of intrepid future performance nor will such data reflect what its results of operations would have been had it operated as an independent  publicly traded company during the historical periods presented 
pro forma consolidated results of operations data for is presented and discussed within this management discussion and analysis to provide meaningful information for comparison purposes 
analytical information for non comparative periods will be discussed and analyzed where meaningful information is deemed to exist and will be presented in the position of greatest prominence 
we will also provide comparative analytical discussion about comparative periods on a pro forma basis 
table of contents consistent with the form and content standards set forth in article b of regulation s x under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the pro forma adjustments relate to expense associated with stock compensation expense  adjustments to reduce interest expense resulting from the repayment of debt  income taxes provided at the statutory rate for the periods related to mining since it was a limited liability company plus the aggregate impact of pro forma adjustments  and for any adjustments associated with weighted average common shares used in the calculation of both basic and diluted earnings per share 
because the same assets were utilized in mining and intrepid before and after intrepid ipo and since there was no material activity in intrepid from its formation in november until the closing of the ipo on april   there are no adjustments necessary to the production or sales results of the periods related to mining in order to create a comparative presentation involving because of this  discussion of comparative operating statistics is unaffected  and the actual historical results of the successor and predecessor periods are presented

recent events and market trends our net income was million  or per share with cash flows from operations of million 
we had capital investments of million in and ended the year with million of cash and investments with no debt outstanding 
our production volumes of potash and trio increased to a combined  tons in from  in as we increased production towards full operating levels throughout during  we experienced improved sales volumes with potash sales of  tons and trio sales of  tons 
we saw a return in agricultural demand to more historically normal levels compared to the lower demand we experienced in the fall of and through most of the demand for fertilizer began to recover in late and continued in with increases in sales volumes for the spring application season and the fall planting season compared to those that occurred in the fall of resulted in strong demand for fertilizer as a result of much of the fall harvest occurring on time or early combined with a prolonged open window of good weather that allowed applications of fertilizer to continue well into december of coupled with the strong demand were low inventory levels of potash in distributor channels throughout as distributors were purposely carrying less inventory than in to avoid the inventory price risk associated with holding inventory 
in addition  crop prices have moved up significantly during the second half of due to increased demand for grains worldwide as well as downward revisions in crop yields by the united states department of agriculture usda resulting in predictions of decreased world grain stocks from million metric tons for to million metric tons for potash prices began to climb in late september through the fourth quarter of as a result of the higher demand levels throughout the fall  the low inventory levels of potash available in the us distribution channels and the overall strength of crop prices across a spectrum of commodities 
we also believe farmers became concerned about the risk of yield losses resulting from large cuts in fertilizer applications during the prior two growing seasons and therefore attempted to replace the nutrients removed from the soil 
current crop economics suggest that farmers are economically motivated to add incremental marginal production and acreage  requiring application of additional nutrients  in order to meet crop expectations 
the near term outlook at the potash producer level appears to be constructive based on several factors  including declines in stock to use ratios of grains in the us and the world  which has driven an increase in grain commodity prices  the profitability outlook for farmers across different commodity types  the low chance of price shocks from nitrogen which can be attributed to the relatively flat natural gas forward curve  and dealers and distributors focusing on maintaining 
table of contents adequate product levels to satisfy farmer demand 
estimated global ending stock to use ratios for corn are at levels not seen in years while estimated ending stock to use ratios for soybeans in the united states are at levels not seen since the mid s 
as such  we anticipate a return to the normal fertilizer application levels experienced prior to the fall of we also note the price of potash is currently low relative to nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers  while crop prices are at levels favorable to balanced fertilization application 
industrial demand for our standard sized potash increased in over  as we sold percent more in industrial sales volumes compared to a year ago 
however  demand for our standard sized product remains below the levels experienced during and due to continued relatively lower levels of oil and gas drilling in the geographic markets served by our mines  in particular  in the rocky mountain region that is served by our utah facilities 
in addition  some drillers have switched to alternatives to standard sized potash or have attempted to forego the use of potash altogether in drilling and completing their wells in an effort to reduce costs 
we believe that potash is the most effective clay inhibitor available  and we are promoting potash as the drilling fluid additive of choice in our traditional industrial markets and working with our key customers to find ways to stimulate demand 
the market for the industrial standard sized potash used in fracture fluids is somewhat regional  and we have experienced differences in demand for our product with respect to the markets served by our carlsbad operations and our utah operations 
our carlsbad operations  which predominately serve texas  oklahoma  louisiana  and new mexico  have experienced higher sales in comparison to the level of sales of standard size potash from our utah operations 
the relatively lower natural gas prices in the rocky mountain region have resulted in a decrease of approximately percent from the high in of the number of rigs drilling for oil and gas in the colorado  utah  and wyoming areas  which  in turn  has resulted in a lower volume of sales of standard sized potash relative to and consequently  we have experienced an accumulation of standard sized potash inventory at our utah facilities 
we have addressed the accumulation of the standard sized potash in our utah facilities  and have increased our marketing flexibility  by successfully completing the construction of a new compactor at our moab facility with the capacity to granulate product in excess of our annual productive capacity 
in addition  we have plans to install a new compactor at our wendover facility that will allow us to granulate all of the product produced at wendover  beginning in we expect that industrial demand for our standard sized product will correlate over the long term with oil and gas pricing  drilling  and well completion activity 
in addition to the effect of lower rig counts  we also experienced more robust competition from canadian producers in the standard sized potash market in the us during  which we believe was a result of the canadian producers selling less product into the international markets where they have typically sold the majority of their standard sized product 
the new compactor at moab is designed to provide granular sized capacity in excess of our anticipated production levels  allowing us to modify our production mix of granular sized and standard sized potash  as needed  to meet demand in the agricultural  industrial  and feed markets that we serve 
the new moab compactor was placed into service in december with full compaction capabilities beginning in the feed component of our sales stayed relatively flat from year to year  however the percentage of our overall sales into this market declined in relative to other markets  as a result of stronger 
table of contents sales into the agricultural market 
the percentages of our potash sales volumes for each of the markets we serve were approximately as follows for the indicated periods agricultural industrial feed for the year ended december  for the year ended december  for the period from april  through december  for the period from january  through april  as a result of both supply and demand trends in the general market for potash  as well as crop prices trending upwards  including prices for corn  soy beans  rice  potatoes  hay cotton  barley  sugar beets and virtually all agricultural commodities  potash prices increased during the last quarter of over the long term  we believe that domestic consumption of fertilizers will remain at historical averages as the replacement of potassium in the soils is critical to continued high yield agricultural production 
this view is supported by data generated by fertecon limited  a fertilizer industry consultant  showing that over the past years the domestic consumption for potash has averaged approximately million tons with annual volatility of approximately percent through historical periods of low and high agricultural commodity prices  variability in oil and gas drilling  negative farmer margins  and a variety of other economic factors 
demand for trio continues to be robust and we expect that granular sized trio sales demand will exceed our production capabilities for the next few quarters  resulting in the need to sell our granular sized product on an allocated basis 
we began activities in contemplation of construction on our langbeinite recovery improvement project in the fourth quarter of this project is designed to increase our recoveries of langbeinite from the current design recovery rates of approximately percent to approximately percent and at the same time  reduce our freshwater usage in the production of trio 
subject to obtaining all required governmental permits and approvals  we also expect to add a granulization plant as part of our langbeinite recovery improvement project 
this plant will produce a prilled or granular sized particle that will supplement our granular sized production capacity resulting in our ability to increase our granular sized product capacity of trio to handle all of our anticipated production 
in july  there was significant rainfall that led to our voluntarily shutting down our langbeinite processing facility to reduce process water generation 
since that time and in conjunction with certain plant modifications that were made in preparation for the construction of the langbeinite recovery improvement project  we have experienced lower recovery rates  at the to percent range  than we had been achieving earlier in we are continuing to work on restoring recovery rates to more typical levels ahead of the completion of our langbeinite recovery improvement project as the demand for granular sized trio remains strong 
if we are unable to increase our recoveries to more typical levels  we will have less trio product to sell which will have a negative effect on our revenues 
selected operations data the following table presents selected operations data for the periods presented below 
analysis of the details of this information is presented throughout this discussion 
we present this table as a summary of information relating to key indicators of financial condition and operating performance that we believe are important 
average net realized sales prices below are derived from the elements in the table presented below and is calculated by deducting freight costs from gross revenues and then 
table of contents by dividing this result by tons of product sold during the period 
costs associated with abnormal production are excluded from the following analysis 
intrepid potash  inc intrepid mining llc predecessor year ended december  year ended december  april  through december  january  through april  combined year ended december  production volume in thousands of tons potash langbeinite sales volume in thousands of tons potash trio gross sales in thousands potash trio total freight costs in thousands potash trio total net sales in thousands potash trio total potash statistics per ton average net realized sales price cash operating cost of goods sold  net of by product credits exclusive of items shown separately below depreciation  depletion  and amortization royalties total potash cost of goods sold warehousing and handling costs average potash gross margin exclusive of costs associated with abnormal production trio statistics per ton average net realized sales price cash operating cost of goods sold exclusive of items shown separately below depreciation  depletion  and amortization royalties total trio cost of goods sold warehousing and handling costs average trio gross margin exclusive of costs associated with abnormal production on a per ton basis  by product credits were   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
by product credits were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
included in the potash cost of goods sold for the fourth quarter of is a reduction to depreciation  depletion and amortization expense of million that was recorded as a result of the decrease in the asset retirement obligation in excess of the net book value of the associated asset 
the impact of this was a per ton reduction in our depreciation  depletion  and amortization for this period 

table of contents operating highlights income before income taxes for the years ended december   and  was million and million  respectively 
the decrease in the comparable periods resulted from a lower average net realized sales price per ton of both potash and trio in compared to we sold  tons and  tons of potash and trio  respectively  in the year ended december   as compared to  and  tons in the year ended december  the fertilizer applications in the spring of were quite strong compared to prior year application levels as the overall agricultural sector recovered and returned to more historically normal activity levels and fertilizer prices decreased from relatively higher levels in previous years 
commodity prices increased during the second half of from the levels experienced in and overall demand for granular sized potash and trio remained strong 
as a result  we realized an percent increase in potash sales volumes from to the fall application season in was particularly strong compared to due to a prolonged open window of good weather that allowed farmers to harvest and begin preparations for the spring planting season 
standard sized potash sales volumes in the year ended december   also increased by approximately percent from sales volumes for the year ended december   particularly from our carlsbad  new mexico operations  as oil and gas drilling activity rebounded from the lows experienced in in the texas  oklahoma and louisiana region 
the percent increase in trio sales volumes was driven largely by a continued strength in domestic sales of inventory carried into from and production  combined with shipments to fulfill export demand for our standard sized product 
our average net realized sales price of potash was per ton in the year ended december   as compared to per ton in the year ended december  the decrease in our average net realized sales price was the result of price reductions we took to remain competitive with the larger canadian producers that produce the majority of the potash sold in the united states 
our pricing was impacted by the actions of our international competitors following their new contract settlements at lower prices into larger potash consuming countries  such as china  india and brazil 
including costs associated with abnormal production  our average potash gross margin as a percentage of net sales was reduced to percent for the year ended december   as compared to percent in the year ended december   and was largely attributable to the lower average net realized sales price 
our production volume of potash in the year ended december   was  tons  or  tons more than in our production was lower in primarily due to actions we took to slow production in response to lower market demand and to manage our inventory 
during the first quarter of  we shut down the west and east production facilities for two weeks each and operated during much of at less than capacity with fewer shifts  particularly at our west mine 
as demand increased through the fourth quarter of and into  we increased staffing levels of mining and plant personnel at our carlsbad facilities and following the hiring and training periods  we now have the staffing of the hourly mine and plant staff at levels which allowed us to increase production rates throughout we realized a decrease in the net realized sales price per ton of trio from per ton in to per ton in  primarily due to the overall decrease in potash prices  which similarly affect our trio pricing 
the downward trend began to reverse itself in the fourth quarter of as we increased our pricing of granular sized trio to per ton effective october   together with a greater than historical average percentage of our trio sales being granular sized domestic sales  resulting in a net realized sales price for trio in the fourth quarter of of per ton 
in february  we increased the posted price of granular sized trio to per ton 
as demand for trio has resulted in us selling granular sized product on an allocated basis  we expect to begin realizing the benefit of this price increase for our granular sized trio product almost immediately  yet our average net realized price will be affected by competitive pricing by our primary competitor and the sales of standard product in to the export market 
our cash operating cost of goods sold for trio  net of by product 
table of contents credits  which we define as total cost of goods sold excluding depreciation  depletion  amortization and royalties  decreased per ton in relative to total cost of goods and cash operating cost of goods sold  net of by product credits  for potash and for trio can be found in the selected operations data tables above 
as we produce both potash and trio from our east mine  we allocate costs between potash and trio 
as the tons of trio produced from the east mine decreased in and the tons of potash from the east mine increased  our costs allocated per ton of trio decreased during in  we directly expensed million of costs related to abnormal production for trio 
our production volume of trio in the year ended december   was  tons  or  tons less than in our production was primarily lower in due to lower recoveries which were specifically impacted by the shutdowns we experienced due to unusually heavy rainfall in the third quarter of and lower ore grade in relative to  as well as lower overall recovery percentages in the second half of ore grade and  to a lesser extent  recoveries are variable items and will cause production differences from time to time  as they are a normal part of operations 
further  in the first quarter of  we directly expensed million of costs related to abnormal production for potash  thus our cash operating cost of goods sold  net of by product credits  for potash was per ton 
the annual result compares to cash operating cost of goods sold  net of by product credits  for potash of per ton  and the expensing of million of costs related to abnormal production for potash in specific factors affecting our results sales our gross sales are derived from the sales of potash and trio and are determined by the quantities of product we sell and the sales prices we realize 
we quote prices to customers both on a delivered basis and on the basis of pick up at our plants and warehouses 
freight costs are incurred only on a portion of our sales 
many of our customers arrange and pay for their own freight directly 
when we arrange and pay for freight  our quotes and billings are based on expected freight costs to the points of delivery 
our gross sales include the freight that we bill  but we do not believe that gross sales provide a representative measurement of our performance in the market due to variations caused by ongoing changes in the proportion of customers paying for their own freight  in the geographic distribution of our products  and in freight rates 
we view net sales  which are gross sales less freight costs  as the key performance indicator as it conveys the sales price of the product that we realize 
we manage our sales and marketing operations centrally and we work to achieve the highest average net realized sales price we can by evaluating the product needs of our customers and then determine which of our production facilities can be utilized to fill these needs by considering which facility can produce and deliver the product to the customer to realize the highest net realized sales price to intrepid 
during  we sold more granular sized tons then we produced and exited the year with our granular sized inventories at low levels as we responded to strong demand for this product 
as we are anticipating strong demand for our granular sized product  we are running our granulation facilities at full capacity at all of our facilities to meet existing orders and to prepare for the coming spring season 
the forward commodity markets for crops has remained strong  at least through the next crop cycle  which should support a continuation of strong demand in the spring of in order to service this strength in the granular sized agricultural market  we placed a new compactor in service at our moab facility in december  which will provide us additional compaction capacity in and beyond 
part of our operating strategy is to have as much flexibility in the specification of product we produce in response to changing market demands 
we are also planning to increase compaction capacity at our wendover and north facilities 
we expect the increase at our wendover facility to begin in and the increase at our north facility to begin in 
table of contents the volume of product we sell is determined by demand for our products and by our production capabilities 
we manage our production levels  as needed  in response to market demand with a view toward managing inventory levels in the near term while ensuring that our balance sheet remains strong 
at the current time  we are working to produce at maximum rates relative to staffing levels  plant capacities  and regularly scheduled maintenance 
we performed annual turnaround maintenance at our carlsbad facilities in the third quarter  including work performed at our east facility  which extended approximately days into the fourth quarter this year 
the timing and duration of the work performed at the east facility were a result of scheduled maintenance requirements and the need to perform certain tasks in anticipation of beginning construction of our langbeinite recovery improvement project as well as making significant upgrades to our electrical systems and repairs to our compaction equipment 
as a result of this maintenance work  we were able to increase production of granular sized potash at our east facility beginning in the fourth quarter of our profitability is directly linked to the sales price of our product  our production rates and the resulting production costs of our products 
the production costs are impacted by production rates and  to a lesser extent  the price of natural gas and other commodities used in the production of potash that affect our variable costs 
our current operating strategy is to run our mining operations and plants at normal operating rates and therefore maintain the lower per unit production costs while at the same time focusing attention on granular sized capacity 
our sales strategy is to seek to maximize our price by selling tonnage into markets near our facilities in new mexico and utah  while at the same time selling a material amount of product into markets further from our facilities 
because of the location of our assets and the regional markets we serve  we see different market prices throughout the united states and actively manage our sales to take advantage of the pricing available in different regions 
we have a significant amount of standard size potash inventory at our moab facility  which we intend to convert to granular sized potash during we expect to place in service a new compactor at our wendover facility as well as additional warehouse capacity  which will allow us to increase production at that facility in and to compact standard size product into granular size product to meet market demands 
until that project at wendover is completed or we develop a market for more standard sized product sales  we anticipate wendover operating rates that are lower than productive capacity  but within normal ranges 
domestic pricing of our products is influenced by  among other things  the pricing established by the canadian producers and other large world producers  the interaction of global supply and demand of potash  ocean  land and barge freight rates  and currency fluctuations 
any of these factors could have a positive or negative impact on the price of our products 
as demand for granular sized potash is currently exceeding production  we were able to increase the posted price for our red granular sized potash several times during the fourth quarter of we expect the full impact of potash price increases to be realized approximately three months after the effective date as we typically have amounts of product already ordered at the time we announce a price increase 
with the strengthening of the commodity prices and the overall health of the agricultural sector  we increased our pricing of granular sized potash to per ton in the fourth quarter of this increase aided in reversing the downward trend of potash pricing we experienced in the first three quarters of the year and resulted in our average net realized sales price per ton of per ton in the fourth quarter  an increase over the per ton realized in the third quarter of our average net realized sales price per ton historically has been less than our posted price due to a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  the different competitive markets in which we sell our products  associated customer discounts  and the mix of standard sized and granular sized product sold into the market 
we believe we have returned to more normalized demand for potash 
to some degree  we consider international prices in determining the prices at which we sell our products 
generally  we have benefited from the weakening us dollar in prior periods 
the potential impact of a weaker us dollar is that canadian suppliers may adjust their sales price in us dollars 
table of contents upward in order to retain their local currency equivalent sales price  potentially allowing for increases in the average net realized sales prices we can obtain for our products 
mitigating the impact of a weaker us dollar is the fact that our sales and costs are denominated in us dollars  therefore  the change in the value of the us dollar against other currencies has less of an effect on us compared to our competitors 
the strengthening we are seeing in pricing more recently  however  is believed to be much more directly linked to the supply and demand fundamentals of the grain markets and the associated profitability to farmers at today commodity prices 
the table below demonstrates the progression of our average net realized sales price for potash and trio in and and the recent reversal of the downward trend we have experienced over the last two years 
average net realized sales price for the three months ended potash trio per ton december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  cost associated with abnormal production we periodically evaluate our production levels and costs to determine if any such items should be deemed abnormal under authoritative generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap with respect to inventory costing 
in the first quarter of  we determined that approximately million of production costs would have been allocated to additional tons produced  assuming intrepid had been operating at normal production rates 
there was no such adjustment made in the remaining quarters of as we believe we were producing within our normal ranges of production 
when such adjustments are recorded  the result is an acceleration of the recognition of this expense and the exclusion of these costs from the accumulated inventory costs and the resulting cost of goods sold elements 
the assessment of normal production levels requires significant management estimates and is unique to each quarter 
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold reflects the transfer from inventory of the accumulated costs to produce our potash and trio products  less credits generated from the sale of our by products 
many of our production costs are largely fixed and  consequently  our costs of sales per ton move inversely with the number of tons we produce  within the context of normal production levels 
our principal production costs include direct labor and employee benefits  maintenance materials  contract labor and materials for operating or maintenance projects  natural gas  electricity  operating supplies  chemicals  depreciation and depletion  royalties  leasing costs  and plant overhead expenses 
there are elements of our cost structure associated with contract labor  consumable operating supplies  and chemicals that are variable  which make up approximately percent of our cost base 
our periodic production costs and costs of goods sold will not necessarily match one another from period to period based on the fluctuation of inventory levels 
inventory levels are a function of previous period ending inventories  production rates  and sales levels 
from a total dollar level in  we have seen an increase in both our overall production costs and our cost of goods sold compared to however  as the production rates from our mines returned to higher levels in as compared to  our per unit costs decreased 
this was particularly true in the fourth quarter as the carlsbad facility had strong production results  driving down our per unit costs 
the dollar value increase in production costs were 
table of contents driven principally by the increased operating rates of our mines and mills in as compared to increased production volumes resulted in higher labor costs  natural gas costs and chemicals 
the increase in cost of goods sold is a reflection of the increase in sales volumes in  compared to  as well as the resulting lower inventory levels in  when compared to we have also been experiencing a decrease in the mill feed grade ore grade at our west mine over the last several years 
in  we began increased mine development work for the west mine  which results in lower delivered ore grade as we build the mine capacity for future years 
mine development work at our mines is part of our overall mine planning and is a continuous activity 
we expect to be in a heavier development phase for the next few years with our development work  particularly at our west mine and to a lesser extent at our east mine 
we expect our development work to be higher in compared to the level of mine development work performed in to date  we have been able to largely offset the decreased ore grade and maintain production levels at our west mine by adding new mining panels  improving hoisting capacity  and adding the underground storage and reclaim system 
each of these projects has contributed to increasing our mining and hoisting rates during as the projects went into full operation at the beginning of the east mine contains a mixed ore body  and the ore grade of ko for the combination of muriate of potash and langbeinite has been percent  percent and percent in  and  respectively 
the mix of ore from our east mine between muriate of potash and langbeinite also will impact the amount of product tons of potash and langbeinite ultimately produced from the facility 
our production costs per ton are also impacted when our production levels change  such as for annual maintenance turnarounds  mine development  or voluntary shutdowns to manage inventory levels 
our labor and contract labor costs in carlsbad may continue to be influenced by the demand for labor in the local potash  oil and gas  and nuclear waste storage industries 
considering the effects of the direct expensing of costs associated with abnormally low production rates in and  cash operating cost of goods sold  net of by product credits  per ton of potash decreased in relative to our cash operating cost of goods sold per ton of potash  net of per ton of by product credits  was per ton in the year ended december   compared to per ton  net of per ton of by product credits  in our lower cash operating cost of goods sold per ton during resulted primarily from higher operating efficiencies 
we pay royalties to federal  state and private lessors under our mineral leases  and such payments are typically a percentage of net sales of minerals extracted and sold under the applicable lease 
in some cases  federal royalties for potash are paid on a sliding scale basis that varies with the grade of ore extracted 
for the years ended december   and december   the period from april   through december   and the period from january   through april   our royalty rate was percent  percent  percent and percent  respectively 
we expect that future average rates will be relatively consistent with these rates 
income taxes we are a subchapter c corporation and  therefore  are subject to federal and state income taxes on our taxable income  where as our predecessor entity  mining  was a limited liability company  which was not directly liable for the payment of federal or state income taxes 
for the years ended december   and december  and the period april   through december   our effective income tax rate was percent  percent and percent  respectively 
our effective income tax rates are impacted primarily by changes in the underlying tax rates in jurisdictions in which we are subject to income tax and permanent differences between book and tax income for the period including the benefit associated with the estimated effect of the domestic production activities deduction 

table of contents the tax basis of the assets and liabilities transferred to us pursuant to the exchange agreement was  in the aggregate  equal to mining adjusted tax basis in the assets as of the date of the exchange  increased by the amount of taxable gain recognized by mining in connection with the formation transactions 
therefore  the tax basis in the assets and liabilities transferred to us is significantly higher than the book basis in the same assets and liabilities 
the basis difference between book and tax generated a net deferred tax asset for us immediately following the transaction 
the net deferred tax asset recorded as of the date of exchange was approximately million  with a corresponding increase to additional paid in capital 
the majority of our deferred tax asset has been assigned to mineral properties  and the anticipated use of percentage depletion to reduce our taxable income  relative to book income  is expected to provide full realization of this asset over time 
as of december   the net deferred tax asset has been reduced to approximately million through its utilization 
we have evaluated our deferred tax assets to determine if the need for a valuation allowance exists  and we have concluded that no valuation allowance is necessary 
we base this conclusion on the expectation that future taxable income should allow us to fully realize these deferred tax assets 
on september   the small business jobs act of was enacted and  on december   the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization  and jobs creation act of became law 
each of these laws provides for additional tax depreciation ie bonus depreciation for qualifying property in the year the asset is placed in service 
the combination of these laws provides for percent bonus depreciation on qualifying assets placed in service after december   through september   and percent bonus depreciation on qualifying assets placed in service after september   through december  the impact of these changes in tax depreciation is significant contributions to a reduction of our current tax provision and an increase of our deferred tax provision for for the year ended december   the total tax expense was million 
total tax expense for the year ended december   was comprised of million of current income tax benefit and million of deferred income tax expense 
for the year ended december   the total tax expense was million 
for  total tax expense was comprised of million of current income tax expense and million of deferred income tax expense 
our current tax expense for these periods is less than our total tax expense in large part due to the impacts of accelerated tax bonus depreciation and the utilization of percentage depletion 
we are required to evaluate our deferred tax assets and liabilities each reporting period using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized 
the estimated statutory income tax rates that are applied to our current and deferred income tax calculations are impacted most significantly by the states in which we do business 
changing business conditions for normal business transactions and operations  as well as changes to state tax rate and apportionment laws  potentially alter our allocation and apportionment of income among the states for income tax purposes 
these changes in allocations and apportionment will result in changes in the calculation of our current and deferred income taxes  including the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the effects of any such changes are recorded in the period of the adjustment 
such adjustments can increase or decrease the net deferred tax asset on the balance sheet and impact the corresponding deferred tax benefit or deferred tax expense on the income statement 
a decrease of our blended state tax rate decreases the value of our deferred tax asset  resulting in additional deferred tax expense being recorded in the income statement 
conversely  an increase in our blended state income tax rate would increase the value of the deferred tax asset  resulting in an increase in our deferred tax benefit 
because of the magnitude of the temporary differences between book and tax bases in our assets  relatively small changes in the blended state tax rate may have a pronounced impact on the value of the net deferred tax asset 

table of contents outlook for the potash market has stabilized markedly compared to the volatility the industry experienced in and the price of corn has increased significantly for front month delivery contracts over the past several months  increasing confidence that farmers should have the economic resources to replace the nutrients drawn from the soil 
in addition  the overall commodity markets for grains  sugar  cotton and other commodities have significantly improved since the end of june there is also a much more stable environment for cattle and hog prices as the impact of herd liquidations has resulted in smaller herd sizes 
this overall strengthening of commodity prices has afforded an opportunity for farmer economics to improve significantly which should benefit potash producers in the form of solid demand and prices 
the stronger potash market that emerged in has allowed producers to bring back production capacity that was idled in and spring fertilizer demand was indicative of the historical market in north america and the summer slow down was also in line with historical norms 
we expect potash demand to be in line with historical norms through the spring and fall seasons as the economics to the farmer are expected to remain favorable 
the pricing outlook will be much more dependent upon the decisions made by the canadian producers as they supply such a significant portion of the demand in the united states 
we believe that our strong balance sheet and the strong market conditions for potash will enable us to develop our strategic capital projects designed to increase production and to execute our marketing strategy to maximize margin on the potash and trio that we sell 
in april  a wind shear struck the product warehouse at the east mine in carlsbad  new mexico 
the warehouse had an insignificant book value 
damage to the warehouse  damage to the product stored in the warehouse  and alternative handling and storage costs were covered by our insurance policies at replacement value  less a million deductible 
through december   we had received million of insurance settlement payments on the related claims  of which million of this amount has been recorded as deferred insurance proceeds on the balance sheet at december   pending the insurer final agreement to the related claims 
the previous receipts of million net of property losses were recognized as insurance settlements from property and business losses in and prior periods  as they represented final settlements with the insurer 
in february  we reached a final settlement in principle with the insurer related to this claim and  subject to the parties finalizing a written agreement memorializing the settlement  we expect to recognize in income the deferred insurance proceeds amount in potash prices the price for potash has been and will continue to be the most significant driver of profitability for our business 
as discussed earlier  prices had contracted from and levels  and the per ton average net realized sales price in for potash was affected by overall market demand and our response to competitive pricing by our competitors 
our average net realized sales price increased in the fourth quarter of compared to the third quarter in response to strong demand and favorable commodity prices for corn and other crops 
we announced several price increases for red granular sized potash during the fourth quarter of  with our current price quoted at per ton effective november  we expect the november price increase to be fully realized by the end of the first quarter of other factors that may impact pricing for include the amount and price at which china will continue buying potash during  fertilizer subsidy policy developments in india  how much demand will be satisfied at current prices  and whether increases in crop prices and other crop nutrients can be sustained 
the current increase in demand has allowed us to sell down our granular sized inventories 
table of contents to historically normal levels for this time of year  putting us into a situation where our sales will be limited to productive capacity for the spring season 
we continue to have demand for our granular sized trio in excess of our productive capacity as the demand for this product remains strong 
trio prices tend to move in relationship to potash 
we expect that the continued demand for this product and the improving agronomic understanding of the benefits of the magnesium and sulfur will provide an opportunity to continue to price this product based on the value to the farmer 
capital investment we operate in a capital intensive industry that requires consistent capital expenditures to replace assets necessary to sustain safe and reliable production 
we believe that  in the long term  demand for potash will remain at  or exceed  historical levels  therefore  we have developed an investment plan at each of our facilities to maintain safe and reliable production  ensure environmental and regulatory compliance  improve and modernize equipment  and increase productivity and recoveries in order to decrease per ton production costs 
this focus on continuing to enhance the operational reliability of our production is particularly directed at our carlsbad facilities with production efficiency  instrumentation  and debottlenecking projects 
our total capital investment in was million  including investment related to our langbeinite recovery improvement project  compaction capability at our moab facility  product storage capacity at our east facility  development of new mining panels  upgrades to and replacement of underground equipment and improvement of our infrastructure 
we anticipate that the bonus depreciation tax laws effective for may increase the demand for construction services  materials and equipment  we are moving to secure services as appropriate 
in  we plan to continue executing our capital strategy that is focused on additional granulation capacity  additional mining capacity  and recovery improvement projects 
as we continue to invest in our facilities  we proactively manage our projects in order to manage cash investment with the need to maintain an appropriate cash level on our balance sheet that will allow us to react strategically to market conditions 
in  our capital projects were funded from current operating cash flows 
in the fourth quarter of  we began activities in contemplation of construction for our langbeinite recovery improvement project  which is designed to increase our recoveries of trio from the langbeinite ore 
as part of this project  we plan to build a plant that will provide us the flexibility and capacity to granulate all of our standard sized product  if market conditions warrant  and have it available for sale into the granular sized market 
in addition  this project is designed to reduce our water usage as it relates to our langbeinite production facility and therefore reduce the need to invest additional capital in water management equipment and storage capacity 
we expect completion and operation of the project by the end of assuming timely receipt of all required governmental permits and approvals 
the total capital investment for this project is expected to be between and million  of which million has been invested as of december  we are committed to the expansion of our langbeinite production and to increasing our marketing efforts to educate farmers about the agronomic benefits of trio 
we continue to prepare for construction of the hb solar solution mine  a project to develop and build a solution mine combined with solar evaporation ponds 
project cost estimates remain in the range of and million  of which million has been invested to date 
we expect to invest the bulk of this capital after we receive all of the necessary approvals and permits from the state and federal regulatory agencies 
in july  a ground water discharge permit for the hb solar solution mine was approved by the new mexico environment department nmed  which represented the achievement of an important regulatory milestone 
the eis review being undertaken by the bureau of land management blm is continuing to progress 
based on the schedule provided to us by the blm consultant  we currently anticipate that the record of decision from the eis process will be completed in the first quarter of once all of the necessary regulatory permits and approvals are 
table of contents obtained  construction will begin promptly and first production should result approximately months later  with ramp up to full production expected in the succeeding year  assuming the benefit of an average annual evaporation cycle applied to full evaporation ponds 
total capital investment in is estimated to be between and million 
a breakdown of our capital investment plan includes approximately to million to replace assets needed to maintain production and complete compliance projects  to million to increase productive capacity as described more fully below  and to million to continue the replacement of the east facility warehouse 
we expect our capital program to be funded out of cash flow and existing cash and investments 
the following are a few of the projects that are slated for investment and or completion in to improve the overall reliability of the operations  increase productive capacity and compaction capacity our langbeinite recovery improvement project is a high priority project in due to the expected increase in langbeinite production and resulting lower average cash cost per product ton at the east facility 
of the total capital investment for the project  approximately million has been invested to date and the balance is expected to be invested in the project schedule  which contemplates completion and commissioning in the fourth quarter of  is highly dependent upon the timing of and our ability to obtain air quality permits from the nmed 
we plan to expand compaction capacity by installing a new compaction facility in wendover so that we can granulate more of our standard size production 
this project will allow us to better adapt to market demand fluctuations for our standard sized and granular sized potash 
the project investment is approximately to million 
assuming timely receipt of all necessary government permits and approvals  we expect to be able to increase granular capacity beginning in we have also begun preliminary engineering related to the expansion of the compaction plant at our north mine 
the total project investment is currently estimated at approximately to million with approximately to million to be expended in assuming timely receipt of all necessary government permits and approvals  we expect to be able to increase granular capacity beginning in we plan to add new equipment  including miners and conveyor systems  in order to develop new mine panels at each of our east and west mines near carlsbad for a total investment of approximately to million in we continue to implement digital control systems and increased instrumentation at our production facilities  particularly in carlsbad 
a combined capital investment of approximately to million is expected for these projects in we intend to improve recoveries of potash at our wendover facility through a series of mill modification projects 
we expect to spend approximately to million on these projects during and expect the full benefit of these projects by all dollar amounts for future capital spending are estimates that are subject to change as projects are further developed  modified  deferred  or canceled 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and investments of million  we had no debt  and we had availability of million under our senior credit facility

intrepid potash  inc intrepid mining llc predecessor year ended december  year ended december  april  through december  january  through april  in thousands cash flows from operating activities cash flows from investing activities cash flows from financing activities operating activities total cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase in cash provided by operating activities in was due primarily to the sales of product early in the year in excess of our production rates which decreased product inventory balances into the spring of  after which our sales of products largely matched production levels 
we experienced more robust overall sales in as compared to  which was a significant contributor to the higher operating cash flows 
these changes were offset by lower net income when comparing to the lower net income and decreased product inventory are reflective of the continued business conditions in our industry  as producers are selling more product than in  although at lower prices 
for the year ended december   product inventories decreased million compared to an increase of million in  due to increased demand for our products reflected in sales tons after the declines in application rates for much of spare part inventory increased million for the year ended december   compared to an increase of million in  as we bring new equipment into our operating facilities 
there is no directly comparable period for an analysis of operating activities on a year to year basis for compared to due to the date of our ipo in april the discussion  therefore  will focus on significant trends in each historical period presented 
total cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   million for the period from april   through december   and million for the period from january   through april  the million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in compared to the combined prior year periods for is due primarily to a decrease in net income because of lower sales and production volumes 
the change in trade accounts receivable in relative to the same period in further contributed to the decrease in cash  as trade accounts receivable increased million relative to a decrease of million in the combined periods of  due primarily to increased sales in the fourth quarter of when compared to a slowing of sales into 
table of contents the fourth quarter of these changes were partially offset by a lower increase in inventory relative to the same period of for the year ended december   inventories increased million relative to an increase of million in the combined prior year periods for  reflecting the same set of events that impacted the change in trade accounts receivable  as more sales in the fourth quarter of relative to the fourth quarter of decreased inventory levels that had also been managed more closely throughout investing activities total cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the amount of cash invested in property  plant  and equipment as well as mineral properties and development costs was million in compared to million in for the year ended december   we invested excess cash in higher yielding corporate and government agency securities by purchasing million of investments and received million in proceeds from maturing investments 
the maturity of these investments is expected to generally match the cash needs for our capital investments 
total cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million in the combined periods for the year ended december  the million in cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   was comprised of million for the period from april   through december   and million for the period from january   through april  cash invested in property  plant and equipment as well as mineral properties and development costs increased to million in the year ended december   from million in the same period of  reflecting our continued efforts to upgrade and enhance the efficiency of our facilities 
for the year ended december   we purchased a million of certificate of deposit investments  net of maturities  in an effort to earn a higher return and liquidated million in investments related to the bond sinking fund 
for the years ended december   and  we received million and million  respectively  of insurance settlements related to property damage  which we used toward the construction of warehousing facilities at the east mine

for the period from january   through april   the predecessor period  net proceeds from long term debt totaled million  and distributions to members of mining totaled million 
this distribution had no net impact to intrepid following the ipo  since mining retained all of its cash balances at the time of the initial public offering 
the distribution was paid out of cash on hand  no amounts were drawn against the senior credit facility to make this distribution 
net proceeds related to the ipo of billion were received in the period from april   through december  of the total cash received related to the ipo  million was distributed to mining  in connection with the formation transactions described previously  and debt of million was repaid 

table of contents senior credit facility intrepid senior credit facility  as amended  is a syndicated facility led by us bank as the agent bank  which provides a total revolving credit facility of million 
the lenders have a security interest in substantially all of the assets of intrepid and certain of its subsidiaries 
obligations under the senior credit facility are cross collateralized between intrepid and certain of its subsidiaries 
intrepid million revolving credit facility has a term through march   and the entire amount of the revolving credit facility was available for use as of december  outstanding balances under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a floating rate  which  at our option  is either the london interbank offered rate libor  plus a margin of between percent and percent  depending upon our leverage ratio  which is equal to the ratio of our total funded debt to our adjusted earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization  or an alternative base rate 
we must pay a quarterly commitment fee on the outstanding portion of the unused revolving credit facility amount of between percent and percent  depending on our leverage ratio 
the senior credit facility contains certain covenants including  without limitation  restrictions on indebtedness  the incurrence of liens  investments and acquisitions  mergers and the sale of assets  guarantees  distributions  and transactions with affiliates 
the senior credit facility also contains a requirement to maintain at least million of working capital  a ratio of adjusted earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization to fixed charges greater than to  and a ratio of the outstanding principal balance of debt to adjusted earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization of not more than to the senior credit facility also contains events of default including  without limitation  failure to pay principal and interest in a timely manner  the breach of certain covenants or representations and warranties  the occurrence of a change in control  and judgments or orders of the payment of money in excess of million on claims not covered by insurance 
intrepid was in compliance with all covenants with respect to the senior credit facility on december  our senior credit facility required us to maintain interest rate derivative agreements to fix the interest rate for at least percent of the projected outstanding balance of our term loan  when we had debt outstanding 
historically  we maintained derivative hedging agreements that were swaps of variable rate interest for fixed rate payments 
despite repaying the amounts outstanding under the senior credit facility at the time of the ipo  we left the interest rate swap agreements in place taking the view that interest rates would rise and that the cost of settling the derivatives would be relatively beneficial as compared to closing out the contracts 
interest rates  however  have decreased  and the liability that we have under these derivative agreements has increased since the date of the ipo 
we review our derivative positions from the perspective of counterparty risk when we are in an asset position and believe that we continue to transact with strong  creditworthy institutions 
notional amounts for which the rate has been fixed as of december   are displayed below termination date notional amount weighted average fixed rate in thousands december  december  the weighted average notional amount outstanding for these derivatives as of december   and the weighted average month libor rate locked in via these derivatives are million and percent 
the interest rate paid under our senior credit facility on any debt varies both with the change in the month libor rate and with our leverage ratio 

table of contents contractual obligations as of december   we had contractual obligations totaling million on an undiscounted basis  as indicated below 
contractual commitments shown are for the full calendar year indicated unless otherwise indicated 
payments due by period total more than years in thousands operating lease obligations purchase commitments natural gas purchase commitments pension obligations asset retirement obligation minimum royalty payments total includes all operating lease payments  inclusive of sales tax  for leases for office space  an airplane  railcars and other equipment

minimum required pension contributions as estimated by our actuaries 
estimated contributions represent additional funds intrepid expects to pay into the pension plan and excludes amounts intrepid has placed in trust as plan assets to fund the pension obligation  as well as the future direct payments by the pension plan to participants 
we are obligated to reclaim and remediate lands which our operations have disturbed  but  because of the long term nature of our reserves and facilities  we estimate that none of those expenditures will be required until after commitments shown are in today dollars and are undiscounted 
estimated annual minimum royalties due under mineral leases  assuming approximately a year life  consistent with estimated useful lives of plant assets 
payments related to derivative contracts cannot be reasonably estimated due to variable market conditions and are not included in the above tables

table of contents results of operations for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  net sales and freight costs net sales of potash increased million  or percent  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  this change was the result of an increase in sales volume of percent offset by a decrease in the average net realized sales price of per ton  or percent 
an increase in the demand for potash and trio resulted in a higher total volume of sales in compared to driven by stronger demand for granular sized product sold into the agricultural market 
as a result of the increased sales volumes in  we sold the higher levels of inventories generated in  including some of the higher cost inventory we had produced throughout net sales of trio decreased million  or percent  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december   due to a percent decrease in the average net realized sales price offset by a percent increase in the volume of sales driven largely by granular sized demand 
freight costs increased million  or percent  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   due primarily to the significant increase in sales volume as well as increased movement of inventory to distribution warehouses 
the mix of customers paying for their own freight is highly variable and affects the freight costs incurred by intrepid and our gross sales 
fluctuations in freight costs are not a key indicator of any business trends or our operating performance  as freight costs are largely borne by our customers  either as part of the cost of the product delivered or as arranged directly by the customer 
cost of goods sold the following table presents our cost of goods sold for potash and trio for the subject periods 
year ended december  change between periods change cost of goods sold in millions costs associated with abnormal production in millions cost per ton of potash sold cost per ton of trio sold per ton potash costs include and of depreciation  depletion  and amortization expense in and  respectively 
per ton trio costs include and of depreciation  depletion  and amortization expense in and  respectively 
total cost of goods sold per ton  which includes royalties and depreciation  depletion and amortization  of potash decreased per ton  or percent  from per ton for the year ended december   to per ton for the year ended december  these per ton results are exclusive of approximately million and million of production costs for potash that were not absorbed into inventory in and  respectively  due to the determination that our production rates were abnormally low for these periods 
the per ton improvement reflects the fact that the higher operating rates of our facilities result in lower per ton costs as the fixed costs structure of the operations is spread over more produced tons 
the cost of goods sold numbers reflect only those costs that have been first absorbed into inventory and then subsequently recognized as the product tons are 
table of contents sold 
higher production rates in are the primary reason that cost of goods sold per ton declined relative to the comparable period in total cost of goods sold of our trio decreased per ton  or percent  from per ton for the year ended december   to per ton for the year ended december  these per ton results are exclusive of approximately million of production costs for trio that were not absorbed into inventory in a lower percentage of shared costs at our east mine were allocated to langbeinite in compared to the same period in the prior year because the ratio of potash to trio production increased  which contributed to the lower per ton costs as more costs were attributed to potash 
cost of goods sold increased million  or percent  from million in the year ended december   to million in the year ended december  the increase in the total expense was driven primarily by the higher volumes of potash and trio sold and an increase in production costs primarily to support higher production and sales volumes  prior to absorption of costs into inventory 
production cost elements that changed materially during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   included increases in labor  depreciation and natural gas costs 
labor and contract labor costs increased million  or percent  in due to increased labor following managed cut backs in operating rates and maintenance projects during depreciation increased million  or percent  in the year ended december   as a result of the capital investment in late and in natural gas costs increased million  or percent  in the year ended december   due principally to higher market rates for this commodity 
higher market rates drove million of the increase  and higher natural gas consumption at our east facility drove million of the increase 
other changes in cost of goods sold followed from increased royalties  chemicals  operating supplies  rental costs  and benefits and employment taxes  as well as a reduction in by product credits  partially offset by decreased insurance and maintenance spending  all as a result of higher operating rates than in selling and administrative expense selling and administrative expenses increased million in as compared to the same period in the change represents a three percent increase from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  the increase largely related to higher stock compensation expense due to an increase in the number of stock options and restricted common stock granted during the year  as well as an increase in bonuses  salaries and benefits in  partially offset by a reduction in professional services relative to the prior period 
income taxes income taxes decreased by million in as compared to the same period in income taxes of million were recognized in the year ended december   at an effective tax rate of percent 
income taxes of million were recognized in the year ended december   at an effective tax rate of percent 
results of operations for the year ended december   and pro forma results of operations for the year ended december  the pro forma presentation for intrepid  as the successor entity  has been prepared assuming that the ipo and the formation transitions including the exchange agreement had occurred on january  
table of contents  for the period 
refer to unaudited pro forma financial information in part iv  item of this report for additional information regarding our pro forma financial information and adjustments 
net sales and freight costs net sales of potash decreased million  or percent  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  this decrease was the net result of an increase in the average net realized sales price of per ton  or percent  and a decrease in volume of percent 
beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing through  there was a reduction in the demand for potash and trio that led to a lower total volume of sales in compared to and also resulted in the building of inventories relative to historical averages 
our production volume of potash in the year ended december   was  tons  or  tons less than in  principally due to our decision to decrease production in response to lower demand 
as part of these efforts  we shut down the west and east mines for two weeks in the first quarter of  and we continued to operate through the balance of with fewer operating shifts  particularly at our west mine 
wendover also was operated at lower than normal rates throughout most of in order to adjust to market demand 
our east mine returned to normal production levels in the third quarter of only to suffer from weather related production disruptions in the fourth quarter of that  in turn  led to lower than normal operating rates in the fourth quarter 
net sales of trio increased million  or percent  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december   due to a percent increase in the average net realized sales price  partially offset by a percent decrease in the volume of sales 
the first quarter of had a single sale of approximately  tons to an international customer  whereas this same customer  we believe  deferred purchasing any large quantity of trio in  having also been affected by underlying market demand 
production of langbeinite decreased percent in compared to  due primarily to the previously mentioned efforts to reduce production in response to lower demand  however  improvements in the rate of recovery of langbeinite from the mixed ore zone mined at our east mine and a somewhat lower grade of potash mined in this mixed ore zone proportionately increased the production of langbeinite relative to potash production in freight costs decreased million  or percent  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   due primarily to lower sales volumes and secondarily to proportionally fewer international sales of trio  however  freight expense increased approximately million as a result of the increased movement of inventory to distribution warehouses pending sale 
as usual  the mix of customers paying for their own freight  the geographic mix of sales  and changing fuel costs affect the freight costs incurred by intrepid and gross sales 
we believe that our net realized price is a more meaningful number to evaluate and compare product revenues 
costs associated with abnormal production approximately million was excluded from the calculation of inventory and instead expensed in for potash production costs that would have been allocated to additional tons produced  assuming intrepid had been operating at normal production rates in included in the million was approximately million related to depreciation expense 
additionally  approximately million was excluded from the calculation of inventory and  instead  expensed in for trio production costs that would have been allocated to additional tons produced  assuming intrepid had been operating at normal production rates in included in the million was approximately million related to depreciation expense 
there were no similar abnormal cost adjustments in

per ton trio costs include and of depreciation expense in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the aforementioned abnormal production expenses are excluded from inventory costs and  therefore  are also excluded from cost of goods sold 
the total cost of goods sold per ton of potash increased per ton  or percent  from per ton on a pro forma basis for the year ended december   to per ton for the year ended december  while production expenditures declined by million in relative to  the decrease in production levels  even after the abnormal production adjustment described above  led to the relative increase in the cost per ton 
the total cost of goods sold of our trio increased per ton  or percent  from per ton on a pro forma basis for the year ended december   to per ton for the year ended december  the overall percent increase in trio costs of goods sold was comprised of an increase in cost  principally resulting from a greater allocation of joint costs to trio  based on its proportionally greater level of production relative to potash produced at our east mine  and an increase driven by lower overall production relative to that in aggregate dollars associated with cost of goods sold decreased million  or percent  from million on a pro forma basis in the year ended december   to million in the year ended december  the decrease in the total expense was driven by the lower volumes sold 
production costs in  relative to  decreased by approximately percent in total 
there were decreases in spending on natural gas  contract labor  royalties  electricity  labor  fuel  and supplies  partially offset by increased costs of depreciation  property taxes  and insurance  as well as a reduction in by product credits 
labor and contract labor costs decreased million  or percent  in due to reduced labor following the voluntary shutdowns in the first quarter of and continued reductions in operating rates to manage inventory levels 
natural gas expense decreased million  or percent  in the year ended december  lower rates drove million of the decrease and lower volumes drove million of the decrease 
additionally  realized and unrealized gains and losses on natural gas derivatives caused a million decrease in the expense 
electricity costs decreased million  or percent  in the year ended december   due to a decrease in volume of million and a decrease in rates of million 
royalty expense decreased million  or percent  from the year ended december   which corresponds to the reduction in net sales on which royalties are based 
property tax expense increased million  or percent  from the year ended december   due to increased property valuations based on revenue generated in prior periods 
insurance expense increased million  or percent  in due to higher insurance premiums 
other changes in cost of goods 
table of contents sold followed from decreased fuel costs  decreased usage of operating and packaging supplies  and increased depreciation expense based on increased capital investment 
by product sales credits reduced cost of goods sold by million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of million resulting from a decline in the average selling price of the by products 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses decreased million in as compared to the pro forma expenses for the same period in the change represents an percent decrease from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  increases in expense related to an entire year worth of costs for administrative and management staff associated with becoming a publicly traded company were more than offset by a decrease in stock compensation expense in  relative to a higher pro forma compensation expense in for awards issued in connection with the ipo that vested seven months after grant and  secondarily  by lower bonus expense related to performance 
other income expense pro forma other income expense was a net income of million for the year ended december   and a net expense of million for the year ended december  the change was due primarily to insurance settlements of million in excess of property losses during the year ended december   and the effect of gains and losses on interest rate swaps and bond sinking fund investments 
a pro forma adjustment assuming an earlier ipo date and earlier debt repayment largely eliminated the impacts of the repayment of debt and increase in invested cash in the second quarter of for the year ended december   insurance settlements in excess of property losses of million were received in connection with the east mine wind shear claim 
through december   intrepid has received million from the insurer for the related claim  million of this amount was received in and is reported as a liability at december   pending the insurer agreement to the related claims 
additional insurance payments to reconstruct the warehousing facilities are still contingent upon review by the insurer and  therefore  will be recognized in other income as settlements are agreed upon 
income taxes income taxes of million were recognized for the year ended december   at an effective tax rate of percent 
because mining was a limited liability company  it did not have an income tax expense  so there is no comparable figure for however  our pro forma estimate of income tax expense for the comparable period is million for the year ended december   assuming the statutory tax rate of percent as the effective tax rate 
the decrease in income tax expense was driven by the overall decrease in income levels between the respective periods 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements 
actual results could differ from such estimates and assumptions  and any such differences could result in material changes to our financial statements 
the following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting policies and estimates 
our significant accounting policies are further described in note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue is recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists  risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to customers  which is generally when title passes  the selling price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
title passes at the designated shipping point for the majority of sales  but  in a few cases  title passes at the delivery destination 
the shipping point may be the plant  a distribution warehouse  a customer warehouse  or a port 
title passes for some international shipments upon payment by the purchaser  however  revenue is recognized for these transactions upon shipment because the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred pursuant to a contractual arrangement 
prices are generally set at the time of  or prior to  shipment 
in cases where the final price is determined upon resale of the product by the customer  revenue is deferred until the final sales price is known 
we quote prices to customers both on a delivered basis and on the basis of pick up at our plants and warehouses 
we incur and bill the customer and record as gross revenue the product sales value  freight  packaging  and certain other distribution costs only when we are responsible for such costs  however  many customers arrange for and pay for these costs directly and in these situations  only the product sales value is included in gross revenues 
application of this policy requires that we make estimates regarding creditworthiness of the customer  which impacts the timing of revenue recognition  and ultimately  the determination of allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make those estimates based on the most recent information available and historical experience  but they may be affected by subsequent changes in market conditions 
property  plant  and equipment property  plant  and equipment are stated at historical cost or at the allocated values determined upon acquisition of business entities 
expenditures for property  plant  and equipment relating to new assets or improvements are capitalized  provided the expenditure extends the useful life of an asset or extends the asset functionality 
property  plant  and equipment are depreciated under the straight line method using estimated useful lives 
estimated useful lives range from to years 
useful lives are reviewed periodically and changed as necessary 
gains or losses from normal sales  disposals  or retirements of assets are included in other within operating income 
mineral properties and development costs mineral properties and development costs  which are referred to collectively as mineral properties  include acquisition costs  the cost of drilling wells  and the cost of other development work  all of which are capitalized 
depletion of mineral properties is calculated using the units of production method over the estimated life of the relevant ore body 
the lives of reserves used for accounting purposes are shorter than current reserve life determinations prepared by us  and reviewed and independently determined by mine consultants  due to uncertainties inherent in long term estimates 
reserve studies and mine plans are updated periodically  and the remaining net balance of the mineral properties is depleted over the updated estimated life  subject to a year limit 
possible impairment is also considered in conjunction with updated reserve studies and mine plans 
our proven and probable reserves are based on extensive drilling  sampling  mine modeling  and mineral recovery from which economic feasibility has been determined 
the price sensitivity of reserves depends upon several factors including ore grade  ore thickness  and ore mineral composition 
the reserves are estimated based on information available at the time the reserves are calculated 
recovery rates vary depending on the mineral properties of each deposit and the production process used 
the reserve estimate utilizes the average recovery rate for the deposit  which takes into account the processing methods scheduled to be used 
the cutoff grade  or lowest grade of mineralized material considered economic to process  varies with material type  mineral recoveries  operating costs  and expected selling price 
proven and probable reserves are based on estimates  and no assurance can be given that the indicated levels of recovery of potash and langbeinite will be realized or that production costs and estimated future development costs will not exceed the net realizable value of the products 
tons of potash and langbeinite in the proven and probable reserves 
table of contents are expressed in terms of expected finished tons of product to be realized  net of estimated losses 
reserve estimates may require revision based on actual production experience 
market price fluctuations of potash or trio  as well as increased production costs or reduced recovery rates  could render proven and probable reserves containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to exploit and might result in a reduction of reserves 
in addition  the provisions of our mineral leases  including royalties payable  are subject to periodic readjustment by the state and federal government  which could affect the economics of our reserve estimates 
significant changes in the estimated reserves could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
inventory inventory consists of product and by product stocks which are ready for sale  mined ore  potash in evaporation ponds  and parts and supplies inventory 
product and by product inventory cost is determined using the lower of weighted average cost or estimated net realizable value 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated net realizable value  we adjust our inventory balance accordingly 
if the actual sales price ultimately realized were to be less than our estimate of net realizable value  additional losses would be incurred in the period of liquidation 
cost includes direct costs  maintenance  operational overhead  depreciation  depletion  and equipment lease costs applicable to the production process 
direct costs  maintenance  and operational overhead include labor and associated benefits 
the value of potash within the solar ponds  which is considered work in process inventory  is estimated based on the amount of finished inventory expected to be recovered and the lower of cost incurred through the stage of completion or net realizable value less costs to complete the process 
significant estimates are used in the allocation of costs to different products  including by products 
we evaluate production levels and costs to determine if any should be deemed abnormal  and therefore excluded from inventory costs 
if our analysis concludes that production levels or costs during a certain period are deemed abnormal  the associated costs will be excluded from inventory and instead expensed during the applicable periods 
the assessment of normal production levels is judgmental and is unique to each period 
we model normal production levels and evaluate historical ranges of production by operating plant in assessing what is deemed to be normal 
we also conduct detailed reviews related to the net realizable value of parts inventory  giving consideration to quality  slow moving items  obsolescence  excessive levels  and other factors 
parts inventories not having turned over in more than a year  excluding parts classified as critical spares  are reviewed for obsolescence and included in the determination of an allowance for obsolescence 
recoverability of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable 
impairment is considered to exist if an asset total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the related asset 
an impairment loss is measured and recorded based on the discounted estimated future cash flows 
changes in significant assumptions underlying future cash flow estimates or fair values of assets may have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
factors we generally will consider important and which could trigger an impairment review of the carrying value of long lived assets include the following significant underperformance relative to expected operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of assets or the strategy for our overall business  the denial or delay of necessary permits or approvals that would affect the utilization of our tangible assets  underutilization of our tangible assets  discontinuance of certain products by us or our customers  
table of contents a decrease in estimated mineral reserves  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
although we believe the carrying values of our long lived assets were realizable as of the balance sheet dates  future events could cause us to conclude otherwise 
asset retirement obligation all of our mining properties involve certain reclamation liabilities as required by the states in which they operate or by the blm 
these asset retirement obligations are reviewed and updated at least annually with any changes in balances recorded as adjustments to the related assets and liabilities 
changes in estimates result from changes in estimated probabilities  amounts  refinements in scope  technological developments  and timing of the settlement of the asset retirement obligation  as well as changes in the legal requirements of an obligation 
the estimates of amounts to be spent are subject to considerable uncertainty and long timeframes 
changes in these estimates could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
scheduled maintenance each operation typically shuts down periodically for maintenance 
the new mexico operations have historically shut down for up to two weeks to perform turnaround maintenance 
generally  the moab and wendover operations cease harvesting potash from our solar ponds during one or more summer months to make the most of the evaporation season 
during these summer turnarounds  annual maintenance is performed 
the costs of maintenance turnarounds are considered part of production costs and are absorbed into inventory in the period incurred 
income taxes we are a subchapter c corporation and therefore are subject to us federal and state income taxes 
we recognize income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized 
we record a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be realized in full  such determinations are subject to ongoing assessment 
with respect to the accounting and disclosure requirements for income taxes  we follow the accounting guidance of topic  income taxes  of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification 
this guidance addresses the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return as well as disclosure requirements associated with such positions 
a current assessment of our tax positions has been made and  as a result  there has been no material effect on our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
before completion of the ipo in april  mining operated as a limited liability company  which did not pay federal or state income taxes 
mining taxable income or loss has been included in the state and federal tax returns of its members 
derivatives on occasion  we enter into financial derivative contracts to fix a portion of our natural gas costs when natural gas purchase transactions are probable and the significant characteristics and expected timing are identified 
these derivative contracts have not been designated as an accounting hedge and changes in their fair market values are included in the consolidated statements of operations 
the realized and unrealized gains or losses resulting from the natural gas derivative contracts are recorded as a component of natural gas expense within cost of sales 
we also entered into interest rate derivative instruments when we had outstanding debt  in order to swap a portion of floating rate debt to fixed rate when borrowings were probable and the significant characteristics and expected timing were identified 
these instruments were transferred to us at the 
table of contents time of the formation transactions 
these items were not accounted for as an accounting hedge  accordingly  any change in fair value from period to period associated with realized and unrealized gains or losses on interest rate derivative contracts is shown within interest expense 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation by recording expense using the fair value of the awards at the time of grant 
we have recorded compensation expense associated with the issuance of non vested restricted common stock awards with service conditions and non qualified stock option awards that are subject to a service period  and the expense associated with such awards is recognized over the associated service period 
there are no performance or market conditions associated with these awards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our operations may be impacted by commodity prices  geographic concentration  changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
commodity prices potash and trio  our principal products  are commodities but are not traded on any commodity exchange 
as such  direct hedging of the prices for future production cannot be undertaken 
generally  we do not enter into long term sales contracts with customers  so prices will vary with each particular transaction and the individual bids that we receive 
our potash is marketed for sale into three primary markets which are the agricultural market as a fertilizer  the industrial market as a component in drilling fluids for oil and gas exploration  and the animal feed market as a nutrient 
prices will vary based upon the demand from these different markets 
our net sales and profitability are determined principally by the price of potash and trio and  to a lesser extent  by the price of natural gas and other commodities used in the production of potash and langbeinite 
the price of potash and trio is influenced by agricultural demand and the prices of agricultural commodities 
decreases in agricultural demand or agricultural commodity prices could reduce our agricultural potash and trio sales 
if natural gas and oil prices were to decline enough to result in a reduction in drilling activity  our industrial potash sales would decline 
our costs and capital investments are subject to market movements in other commodities such as natural gas  steel  and chemicals 
we have entered into derivative transactions for the purchase of natural gas in the past 
as of december   we had no natural gas derivative contracts 
geographic concentration we primarily sell potash into the regions that include agricultural areas west of the mississippi river  oil and gas exploration areas in the rocky mountains and the permian basin  and animal feed production throughout the united states 
our potash mines and many of our customers are concentrated in the western half of united states and are  therefore  affected by weather and other conditions in this region 
interest rate fluctuations our senior credit facility requires us to fix a portion of our interest rate exposure through the use of derivatives when we have long term debt outstanding 
although we currently have no long term debt outstanding  we have left in place certain derivative contracts that were entered into at a time when we did have long term debt outstanding 
the weighted average notional amount outstanding as of december   and the weighted average month libor rate locked in via these derivatives through december were million and percent  respectively 

table of contents foreign currency exchange rates we typically have low balances of accounts receivable denominated in canadian dollars  and  as a result  we have minimal direct foreign exchange risk 
there is an indirect foreign exchange risk as described below 
the united states imports the majority of its potash from canada and russia 
if the canadian dollar and the russian ruble strengthen in comparison to the us dollar  foreign suppliers realize a smaller margin as measured in their local currencies unless they increase their nominal us dollar prices 
strengthening of the canadian dollar and russian ruble therefore tend to support higher us potash prices as canadian and russian potash producers attempt to maintain their margins 
however  if the canadian dollar and russian ruble weaken in comparison to the us dollar  foreign competitors may choose to lower prices significantly to increase sales volumes while again maintaining margins as measured in their local currencies 
a decrease in the average net realized sales price of our potash would adversely affect our operating results
