item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview hb fuller company is a global formulator  manufacturer and marketer of adhesives and other specialty chemical products 
we are managed through four regional operating segments north america  eimea europe  india  middle east and africa  latin america and asia pacific 
each of the four segments manufactures and supplies adhesives products in the assembly  packaging  converting  nonwoven and hygiene  performance wood  flooring  textile  flexible packaging  graphic arts and envelope markets 
in addition  the north america segment provides construction products such as ceramic tile installation products and hvac adhesives and sealants 
the latin america segment also manufactures and sells paints primarily in the central american countries 
total company when reviewing our financial statements  it is important to understand how certain external factors impact us 
these factors include changes in the prices of commodities  such as crude oil and natural gas global supply and demand of raw materials economic growth rates  and currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar we purchase thousands of raw materials  the majority of which are petroleum natural gas derivatives 
with over percent of our cost of sales accounted for by raw materials  our financial results are extremely sensitive to changing costs in this area 
in addition to the impact from commodity prices  the supply and demand of raw materials also have a significant impact on our costs 
as demand increases in high growth areas  such as the asia pacific region  the supply of key raw materials may tighten  resulting in certain materials being put on allocation 
natural disasters  such as hurricanes  also can have an impact as key raw material producers are shut down for extended periods of time 
we continually monitor capacity utilization figures  market supply and demand conditions  feedstock costs and inventory levels  as well as derivative and intermediate prices  which affect our raw materials 
in we generated percent of our net revenue in the us and percent in eimea 
the pace of economic growth in these areas directly impacts certain industries to which we supply products 
for example  adhesives related revenues from durable goods customers in areas such as appliances  furniture and other woodworking applications tend to fluctuate with the overall economic activity 
in business components such as construction products and insulating glass  revenues tend to move with more specific economic indicators such as housing starts and other construction related activity 
the movement of foreign currency exchange rates as compared to the us dollar impacts the translation of the foreign entities financial statements into us dollars 
as foreign currencies strengthen against the dollar  our revenues and costs increase as the foreign currency denominated financial statements translate into more dollars 
the fluctuations of the euro against the us dollar have the largest impact on our financial results as compared to all other currencies 
in  the currency fluctuations had a positive impact on net revenue of million as compared to key financial results and transactions for included the following net revenue increased percent from primarily driven by the percent increase in sales volume 
gross profit margin decreased to percent from percent in mostly due to the increase in raw material costs 

table of contents cash flow generated from operating activities was million in as compared to in and million in we issued million of new long term debt from our november  note purchase agreement  which was funded in the first quarter of we recorded exit costs and impairment charges of million million after tax to exit our polysulfide based insulating glass product line in europe 
we completed the acquisition of the outstanding shares of revertex finewaters sdn 
bhd 
located near kuala lumpur  malaysia on june  for approximately million 
the global economic conditions showed modest improvement in the first half of and then slowed the second half of the year 
our total year organic sales growth increased percent for compared to after the first six months of  our organic sales growth was percent compared to the same period of our sales volume increased percent in as compared to  however the increase in raw material costs contributed to a decrease in both gross profit margin and operating income compared to in our diluted earnings per share decreased to per share from per share in the most significant factors impacting results were the increase in raw material costs and the exit costs and impairment charges to exit our polysulfide based insulating glass product line 
the exit costs and impairment charges resulted in a pretax loss of million 
on an after tax basis  this was a negative million impact on net income and a negative effect on earnings per share 
in we settled a lawsuit with the former owners of the roanoke companies group  a business we acquired in the settlement resulted in a pretax gain of million which was million after tax or per share 
in we continued to invest to make hb fuller a stronger company 
investments made in included additional resources in our sales and technical organizations  strengthening our management team  completing the construction of a manufacturing facility in china  and the revertex finewaters acquisition in malaysia 
outlook for  we expect to capitalize on the investments we have made and we expect net revenue to grow 
every five or six years we have a rd week in our fiscal year 
will be a week year for us which will contribute to our revenue growth 
the coming quarters may prove to be difficult as raw materials remain in short supply and economic activity remains uncertain 
we expect our cost of raw material to be higher in than despite these expected cost increases  our gross margin should improve as past and planned pricing actions along with other cost management steps get in line with raw material price escalation 
we also expect operating expenses to be leveraged to further enhance our operating margin in our capital spending plans for are higher than in previous years reflecting our confidence in our business and the opportunities we see to improve the productivity of our business and our prospects for growth  especially in the emerging markets 
we have borrowing capacity to support a significant level of merger and acquisition activity 
management continuously evaluates potential opportunities 
our new ceo  jim owens  assumed his role on november  mr 
owens joined the company in prior to being named ceo  mr 
owens was the senior vice president  americas 
in this role  he delivered two successive years of profit growth in our most profitable north american business  led the transformation of our latin american businesses and has been instrumental in driving the growth agenda for the company worldwide 
mr 
owens has nearly years of experience in the adhesives industry 
we expect that mr 
owens broad experience both with our company and in the adhesives industry will be a strong contributing factor to our success in achieving our operational and strategic initiatives in the coming year 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates management s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared 
table of contents in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe the critical accounting policies and areas that require the most significant judgments and estimates to be used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are pension and other postretirement plan assumptions  goodwill impairment assessment  long lived assets recoverability  share based compensation accounting  product  environmental and other litigation liabilities  and income tax accounting 
pension and other postretirement plan assumptions we sponsor defined benefit pension plans in both us and foreign entities 
also in the us we sponsor other postretirement plans for health care and life insurance costs 
expenses and liabilities for the pension plans and other postretirement plans are actuarially calculated 
these calculations are based on our assumptions related to the discount rate  expected return on assets  projected salary increases and health care cost trend rates 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of assumptions employed in these measurements for both the non us and non us plans 
the discount rate assumption is determined using an actuarial tool that applies a yield curve approach which enables us to select a discount rate that reflects the characteristics of the plan 
the tool identifies a broad universe of corporate bonds that meet the quality and size criteria for the particular plan 
this is in contrast to using a specific index that has a certain set of bonds that may or may not be representative of the characteristics of our particular plan 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the pension obligations  which results in higher pension expense 
the discount rate for the us pension plan was percent at november   as compared to percent at november  and percent at november  net periodic pension cost for a given fiscal year is based on assumptions developed at the end of the previous fiscal year 
a discount rate reduction of percentage points at november  would increase pension and other postretirement plan expense approximately million pretax in fiscal discount rates for non us plans are determined in a manner consistent with the us plan 
the expected return on assets assumption on the investment portfolios for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans is based on the long term expected returns for the investment mix of assets in the portfolio based on our investment strategy 
our current investment strategy for the us pension plan is to invest percent of the portfolio in equities and percent in fixed income securities 
the investment mix of assets as of november  was percent equities  percent fixed income securities and percent cash 
the investment mix of assets as of november  for our non us pension plans was percent equities and percent fixed income securities 
asset values declined significantly from the august measurement date in into the second quarter of due to the deterioration of the credit markets before rebounding for the remainder of the combination of the reduced asset values and the higher pension obligations due to the lower discount rate resulted in our pension plans being significantly under funded 
therefore  in the fourth quarter of we elected to contribute million to the us pension plan for the purpose of restoring the asset values up to the level of the projected benefit obligations and to reduce net periodic benefit cost 
as of november  the us pension plan assets were just percent below the plan s projected benefit obligations 
as of november  the million had not yet been allocated to the targeted investments  therefore  the investment mix of assets as of november  was percent equities and percent fixed income securities 
our investment strategy for the non us pension plans was also amended in to be more balanced between equities and fixed income securities 
for reasons similar to the us plan  we also contributed million to the german plan in the fourth quarter of the expected return on assets used in calculating the net periodic benefit cost for the us pension plan was percent for  percent for and percent for for  the rate will change to percent 
a change of percentage points for the expected return on assets assumption would impact us net pension and other postretirement plan expense by approximately million pretax 
expected return on asset assumptions for non us plans is determined in a manner consistent with the us plan 

table of contents the projected salary increase assumption is based on historic trends and comparisons to the external market 
higher rates of increase result in higher pension expenses 
as this rate is also a long term expected rate  it is less likely to change on an annual basis 
in the us  we have used the rate of percent for  percent for and percent for goodwill goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a purchase business combination 
goodwill is assigned to reporting units at the date the goodwill is initially recorded 
once goodwill has been assigned to a reporting unit  it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition and all the activities within a reporting unit are available to support the value of goodwill 
accounting standards require us to test goodwill for impairment annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the estimated fair value 
the goodwill impairment analysis is a two step process 
the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
our judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model 
these assumptions include revenue growth rates  profit margin percentages  discount rates  perpetuity growth rates and future capital expenditures 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is considered to not be impaired 
if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value  there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment 
the second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination  by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one  over the estimated fair values of the individual assets  liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit  there is no impairment 
if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit  and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill 
subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted 
in after our initial annual assessment  we determined that our goodwill was not impaired 
in the fourth quarter of however  as economic conditions worsened and the capital markets became distressed  we determined that circumstances had changed enough to trigger another goodwill impairment assessment as of november  that assessment resulted in the determination that the fair value of our construction products reporting unit was less than the carrying value of its net assets  including goodwill 
this was due to a decline in the estimated future discounted cash flows expected from the reporting unit 
the adverse economic conditions  especially in the us housing and other construction markets  were the primary driver of the reduction in forecasted discounted cash flows 
the amount of the pretax impairment charge in the fourth quarter of was million million after tax 
the million pretax charge was an estimated amount as of november  the final valuation work was completed in the first quarter of and resulted in an additional pretax impairment charge of million million after tax 
the amount of goodwill assigned to the construction products reporting unit was million prior to any impairment charges 
after the final valuation and additional impairment charge  the amount of goodwill is million 
in the fourth quarter of  we conducted the required annual test of goodwill for impairment 
there were no indications of impairment 
of the goodwill balance of million as of november   million resides in the north america adhesives reporting unit and million resides in eimea 
in both of these reporting units  the calculated fair value exceeded the carrying value of the net assets by a significant margin 
the construction products reporting unit  which resides in the north america segment  had a goodwill balance of million as of november  the calculated fair value of this reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately percent 
the goodwill balance in the asia pacific segment of million as of 
table of contents november  included million of goodwill from the recent revertex finewaters acquisition in malaysia 
the calculated fair value of this reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately percent 
the construction products reporting unit continues to be the reporting unit with the least amount of excess fair value over its carrying value 
the residential construction market in the us began to stabilize in and our construction products reporting unit had net revenue growth of percent over mainly due to increased sales volume 
the construction products reporting unit exceeded its revenue and earnings projections in the fair value for the construction products reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately percent 
the projected cash flows used in the fair value calculation were based on continued growth in for years beyond  the net revenue projections assume continued growth in through with a leveling off in the low single digits for the remaining years 
operating earnings for the construction products reporting unit are projected to grow primarily due to revenue growing at a higher rate than sg a expenses thereby providing better leverage in earnings in future years 
although we believe the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the construction products reporting unit are realistic  a slowdown of the us residential construction industry could have an adverse impact on construction products future cash flows 
if the reporting unit does not meet its revenue and cash flow projections for  then the fair value could fall below the carrying value of the net assets 
that would trigger a step analysis and could lead to an impairment charge if the implied goodwill is calculated to be less than the million goodwill balance 
in all other reporting units  the calculated fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value of the net assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
recoverability of long lived assets the assessment of the recoverability of long lived assets reflects our assumptions and estimates 
factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume  prices  inflation  currency exchange rates  tax rates and capital spending 
significant judgment is involved in estimating these factors  and they include inherent uncertainties 
the measurement of the recoverability of these assets is dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions used in making these estimates and how the estimates compare to the eventual future operating performance of the specific businesses to which the assets are attributed 
judgments made by us related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and the ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets  changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
during the second quarter of  we decided to exit our polysulfide based insulating glass product line in europe 
this product line was failing to meet return on gross investment targets 
in accordance with accounting standards  we determined that the carrying amount of this asset group was not recoverable and was therefore impaired 
we calculated the fair value of the asset group using a discounted cash flow approach 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded pre tax asset impairment charges of million to write down the value of intangible assets and million to write down property  plant and equipment 
share based compensation we have granted stock options  restricted stock and deferred compensation awards to certain employees and non employee directors 
we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted after december  and prior to but not yet vested as of december   in accordance with accounting standards 
under the fair value recognition provisions of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc and  we recognize share based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award normally the vesting period 

table of contents determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
we use the black scholes model to value our stock option awards 
we believe that future volatility will not materially differ from our historical volatility 
thus  we use the historical volatility of our common stock over the expected life of the award 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the estimate  share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what has been recorded in the current period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on share based compensation 
product  environmental and other litigation liabilities as disclosed in item and in note and note to the consolidated financial statements  we are subject to various claims  lawsuits and other legal proceedings 
reserves for loss contingencies associated with these matters are established when it is determined that a liability is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the assessment of the probable liabilities is based on the facts and circumstances known at the time that the financial statements are being prepared 
for cases in which it is determined that a liability has been incurred but only a range for the potential loss exists  the minimum amount of the range is recorded and subsequently adjusted as better information becomes available 
for cases in which insurance coverage is available  the gross amount of the estimated liabilities is accrued and a receivable is recorded for any probable estimated insurance recoveries 
as of november   we have accrued million for potential liabilities and million for potential insurance recoveries related to asbestos litigation 
we have also recorded million for environmental investigation and remediation liabilities  including million for environmental remediation and monitoring activities at our sorocaba  brazil facility as of november  a complete discussion of environmental  product and other litigation liabilities is disclosed in item and note to the consolidated financial statements 
based upon currently available facts  we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of any pending legal proceeding  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our long term financial condition 
however  adverse developments and or periodic settlements could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flows in one or more future quarters 
income tax accounting as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
increases in the valuation allowance result in additional expense to be reflected within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income 
at november   the valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets totaled million

results of operations net revenue in millions vs vs net revenue 
table of contents net revenue in of  increased million or percent from net revenue of  million 
the net revenue was million or percent below the net revenue of  million in we review variances in net revenue in terms of changes related to product pricing  sales volume  changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions 
the following table shows the net revenue variance analysis for the past two years vs vs product pricing sales volume currency acquisitions organic sales growth  which we define as the combined variances from product pricing and sales volume  increased percent positive percent from sales volume and percent from selling prices in as compared to all of our operating segments had positive organic sales growth in compared to the organic sales growth was driven by double digit growth in both the eimea operating segment and the latin america adhesives component and nearly double digit growth in the asia pacific operating segment 
north america adhesives and construction products both had over percent organic sales growth compared to last year 
the net revenue variances from acquisitions were due to the revertex finewaters acquisition in the third quarter of and the acquisition of nordic adhesive technology during the second quarter of comparing to  organic sales growth was a negative percent negative percent from sales volume and positive percent from selling prices 
the sales volume declines were directly related to the continuation of the slow global economy 
the volume trend in terms of year over year comparisons improved in the second half of  partially due to the weaker second half of the negative currency effects resulted from the stronger us dollar as compared to most major foreign currencies  such as the euro  australian dollar and canadian dollar  as compared to the net revenue variances from acquisitions were due to the egymelt acquisition in the fourth quarter of and the acquisition of nordic adhesive technology during the second quarter of cost of sales in millions vs vs cost of sales percent of net revenue the cost of sales increased percent in compared to the increase was driven primarily by the percent increase in sales volume in and the increases in raw material costs due to supply shortages 
each of our four operating segments was impacted by the supply shortages 
the shortages were driven by refineries reducing the supply of the by products that are used as raw materials in the production of adhesives and increased demand in adjacent industries 
the cost of sales included million of charges in the second quarter related to the exit of the window polysulfide based product line in the eimea operating segment 
the cost of sales decreased percent in compared to the decrease was driven primarily by the percent decline in sales volume in lower raw material prices and the effects of foreign currency fluctuations also contributed to the lower cost of sales in as compared to the cost of sales included million of charges related to the realignment of production capacity in the north america operating segment 

table of contents gross profit in millions vs vs gross profit percent of net revenue the lower gross profit margin for as compared to was primarily driven by the higher raw material costs which more than offset the benefits from increased sales volume and product pricing

as a percent of net revenue  the sg a expenses were percent in and percent in a primary reason for the increase in the percent of net revenue is that sg a expenses are generally fixed in nature over the short term and therefore do not fluctuate as rapidly as the net revenue figures 
asset impairment charges in millions asset impairment charges in we exited our polysulfide based insulating glass product line in europe 
this was a commodity product line that was failing to meet return on gross investment targets 
exiting this product line improves the profitability profile of our eimea operating segment 
in accordance with accounting standards  we determined that the carrying amount of this asset group was not recoverable and was therefore impaired 
we calculated the fair value of the asset group using a discounted cash flow approach 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded pre tax asset impairment charges of million to write down the value of intangible assets 
in the fourth quarter of an million impairment charge was taken as a reduction of the goodwill balance of the construction products reporting unit 
this amount was considered an estimate as of november  with final valuation work to be completed in the first quarter of the additional charge of million in the first quarter of was the result of the final valuation work 
the asset impairment charges in also included million related to two cost method investments

total north america net revenue increased percent in as compared to economic conditions in north america were beginning to shows signs of improvement in early  however recovery slowed in the second half of the year 
additionally  raw material shortages caused adverse negative impact on our gross profit in the second half of sales volume increased percent and average selling prices were up percent over sales volume increases were the result of the stabilizing economy and new business 
the increase in average selling prices resulted from pricing actions taken in response to the escalation in raw material costs in the adhesives business 
gross profit margins decreased slightly in due to the increasing raw material costs 
despite the decrease in gross profit margins  operating income increased percent over mainly due to the increase in sales volume 
as a percent of net revenue  the operating income was percent in and percent in the continued slowdown in the us economy was the primary driver for net revenue declining percent in as compared to the economic slowdown impacted all markets with the construction related markets still being hit the hardest 
sales volume decreased percent while average selling prices were percent above last year 
the increase in average selling prices resulted from pricing actions taken in the second half of in response to the escalation in raw material costs 
gross profit margins increased in in response to decreasing raw material costs 
the improvement in the gross profit margin was the primary reason for operating income increasing more than percent over as a percent of net revenue  the operating income was percent in and percent in adhesives sales volumes increased percent in the adhesives component and average selling prices increased percent over the adhesives sales volume increased as a result of a stronger economy in compared to a recession burdened and also due to a full year s impact of new business won late in the average selling prices increased as a result of pricing actions taken during the impact of the increases in sales volume and average selling prices was a percent increase in net revenue in as compared to raw material shortages and corresponding price hikes impacted the north america adhesives component throughout and especially during the second half of the year 
these increasing raw material costs caused a decline in gross profit margins in as compared to despite the sales volume growth 
sg a expense as a percent of net revenue was relatively flat year over year which contributed to the percent increase in operating income in as compared to net revenue in the adhesives component declined percent in as compared to increases in average selling prices of percent as compared to partially offset the percent decrease in sales volume 
the adhesives sales volumes were down across most major product lines and industries as a result of the slow us economy 
in  million in charges were recorded in cost of sales related to the realignment of production capacity in response to the reduced sales volume 
decreases in raw material prices combined with effective selling price management resulted in an improved gross profit margin in as compared to sg a expenses increased in as key management vacancies were filled  investments were made in sales and marketing and variable compensation expense increased as the financial performance improved 
overall  the gross profit margin improvement was the key driver in operating income increasing percent in as compared to construction products the residential construction market in the us began to stabilize in the first half of then moderating conditions during the second half of the year slowed sales momentum 
the stabilizing economy compared to very sluggish market conditions during benefited results 
net revenue increased percent in compared to the increase in sales volume of percent was slightly offset by a percent decrease in average selling prices 
sales volume growth is attributed to both the stabilizing economy and 
table of contents new business  especially in our retail products 
gross profit margins were flat in compared to as the construction products component was not significantly impacted by raw materials shortages 
in addition  reformulations and other efforts dampened the impact of raw material price increases 
the increase in sales volume contributed to operating income increasing percent in compared to as sg a expenses were flat year over year 
the construction related industries in the u 
s continued to be sluggish in  especially residential market conditions 
major customers in this component are wholesale ceramic tile and flooring distributors selling directly to contractors and also large retail outlets 
these customers were directly impacted by the slowdown in the us housing industry 
us housing starts continued to decline throughout to a point in which the annualized housing start figure reported in october was only million  the lowest figure reported in at least years 
this was the primary factor in the construction products net revenue declining percent in as compared to decreases in raw material costs were the main reason for improvements in the gross profit margin in as compared to manufacturing costs in decreased from as costs were managed downward in response to the lower sales volume 
the strength of the gross profit margin was not enough to offset the decrease in sales volume as operating income decreased percent compared to eimea in millions vs vs net revenue operating income segment profit margin the following table provides details of the eimea net revenue variances

the combination of higher raw material costs  the polysulfide based insulating glass product line exit charges and the increase in sg a expense led to a percent decrease in operating income in compared to sales volume in eimea declined percent in compared to the volumes were down across all major industries  with construction and durables applications showing the largest declines 
the impact of the stronger us dollar in as compared to had a negative percent impact on the net revenue as compared to declines in raw material prices and a focus on procurement together with effective selling 
table of contents price management resulted in improved gross profit margins in as compared to excluding the effects of the currency fluctuations against the dollar  sg a expenses increased in as compared to the egymelt and nordic acquisitions contributed to the sg a expense increases in as well as investments made in the sales and marketing area 
the resulting operating income was below by million or percent

the costs of these allocated resources are not tracked on a where used basis as financial performance is managed to maximize the total operating segment performance 
therefore  the above financial information should only be used for directional indications of performance 
total latin america both adhesives and paints had positive net revenue growth in compared to adhesives showed net revenue growth from early in the year  while paints experienced a second half turnaround 
average selling prices increased percent and sales volume increased percent compared to the percent increase in net revenue offset the raw material cost increases in adhesives and increased spending in sg a  leading to a percent increase in operating income in compared to net revenue decreased percent in as compared to sales volume declines of percent were partially offset by increases in average selling prices of percent 
the sales volume in the paints component was hit especially hard as this is a more consumer driven market than adhesives and therefore  was impacted more negatively by the slow economy 
the gross profit margin increased from due to reductions in raw material costs combined with the increases in average selling prices 
operating income for the latin america segment was percent above adhesives sales volume increased percent and pricing increased percent 
the revenue growth can be attributed to improved economic conditions as well as increases in market share 
the gross profit margin 
table of contents decreased in compared to due to the significant increase in raw material costs 
supply shortages were the primary cause for the raw material cost increases 
sg a expenses increased from last year at a slightly higher percentage than the increase in revenue 
the decrease in gross profit margin and higher sg a expenses were the key factors in a percent decrease in operating income compared to last year 
sales volume decreases of percent in were offset by increases in average selling prices of percent as compared to the adhesives group had a strong finish to to achieve a net revenue result that exceeded the gross profit margin improved from as raw material prices declined in the percent increase in revenue and improved gross profit margin were the primary reason for the percent operating income improvement in as compared to paints selling price increases had a percent positive effect on net revenue compared to last year and offset the decrease in sales volume of percent for a positive organic sales growth of percent year over year 
the second half of showed strong organic sales growth compared to the first half of the year 
a key component in the second half growth was the sales results in honduras  which experienced political instability in the second half of the gross profit margin increased year over year due to a favorable mix of sales as well as the impact from selling price increases 
the improved margin was the main driver of improved operating income for compared to sales volume declined percent in as compared to the volume decline was partially offset by increases in average selling prices of percent for paints is a consumer driven market  therefore the high unemployment rates and overall slow economy in had a pronounced negative impact on the paints sales volume 
raw material costs decreased in which was the primary reason for an improved gross profit margin in as compared to the improved margin however was not enough to offset the impact from the decrease in sales volumes as the operating income of million in was percent below asia pacific in millions vs vs net revenue operating income segment profit margin the following table provides details of asia pacific net revenue 
the pricing sales volume variance is viewed as organic growth 
vs vs pricing sales volume currency acquisitions total total asia pacific net revenue increased percent in compared to an percent increase in sales volume as compared to was partially offset by a percent decrease in average selling prices 
the increase in net revenue was related to a recovery in economic activity  new business generated in the region and the benefit of our recent acquisition of revertex finewaters in malaysia 
the asia pacific operating segment received a lot of pricing pressure during from the aggressive pricing actions of our competitors which contributed to the slight decrease in average selling prices 
positive currency effects contributed percent to the net revenue growth in the currency effect was driven largely by the strengthening of the australian dollar as compared to the us dollar 
sg a expenses were higher in compared to due to additional expenses for the recent malaysia acquisition and investments made in sales and marketing 
operating income

operating income as a percent of sales was percent in as compared to percent in the asia pacific segment experienced an improvement in the third and fourth quarters of sales volume  which had declined percent in the first six months of as compared to  rebounded to a decrease of percent for the year 
new customer wins and economic recovery in some markets both contributed to the improved sales volume performance 
average selling prices had a positive percent impact on net revenue in as compared to the increases in average selling prices were the result of actions taken in the second half of in response to the escalation in raw material costs during that time 
the percent net revenue reduction due to currency  in compared to  was primarily driven by the weakening of the australian dollar as compared to the us dollar

debt outstanding and debt capacity notes payable notes payable were million at november  this amount mainly represented various short term borrowings that were not part of committed lines 
the weighted average interest rates on these short term borrowings were and percent in and  respectively 
long term debt long term debt consisted of senior notes and a term loan 
the series a and series b senior notes bear a fixed interest rate of percent and mature in fiscal year the series c and series d senior notes bear a fixed interest rate of percent and mature in fiscal year we are subject to prepayment penalties on our senior notes

we currently have no intention to prepay any senior notes 
the term loan matures in there are no prepayment penalties on the term loan 
see the discussion below regarding borrowings on our lines of credit 
we executed interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of obtaining a floating rate of interest on million of the senior notes 
we have designated the million of senior note debt as the hedged item in a fair value hedge 
as required by the accounting standards  we recorded an asset for the fair value of the interest rate swaps hedging instruments totaling million and recognized a liability of million for change in the fair value of the senior notes attributable to the change in the risk being hedged 
this calculation resulted in million being recorded in long term debt as of november  for further information related to long term debt see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
lines of credit we have a million revolving credit agreement with a consortium of financial institutions at november  this credit agreement creates an unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility that we can draw upon for general corporate purposes

selected metrics of liquidity and capital resources key metrics we monitor are net working capital as a percent of annualized net revenue  trade account receivable days sales outstanding dso  inventory days on hand  free cash flow and debt capitalization ratio 
november  november  net working capital as a percentage of annualized net revenue accounts receivable dso days days inventory days on hand days days free cash flow million million debt capitalization ratio current quarter net working capital trade receivables  net of allowance for doubtful accounts plus inventory minus trade payables divided by annualized net revenue current quarter multiplied by four 
trade receivables net of allowance for doubtful accounts multiplied by weeks and divided by the net revenue for the last months of the quarter 
total inventory multiplied by and divided by cost of sales excluding delivery costs for the last months of the quarter 
net cash provided by operations less purchased property  plant and equipment and dividends paid 
total debt divided by total debt plus total equity 
another key metric is the return on gross investment  or rogi 
the calculation is represented by gross cash flow divided by gross investment 
gross cash flow is defined as gross profit adjusted for certain one time items less sg a expenses adjusted for certain one time items less taxes at a non gaap standard rate of percent plus depreciation and amortization expenses less maintenance capital expenditures  a non gaap financial measure defined as percent of total depreciation expense 
gross cash flow is calculated using trailing month information 
gross investment is defined as total assets plus accumulated depreciation less non debt current liabilities less cash 

table of contents rogi was introduced because we believe it provides a true measure of return on investment  it is a better way to internally measure performance and it is focused on the long term 
the rogi calculated at november  was percent as compared to percent at november  higher gross investment in as compared to was the primary reason for the decrease in rogi 
the following table shows the rogi calculation based on the definition above compared to a calculation using all gaap based data 
we believe the use of certain non gaap financial measures provides a better calculation of rogi because they eliminate fluctuations not specifically related to the return on the current investment base 
trailing months as of november  in millions rogi management calculation rogi gaap based calculation gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income taxes depreciation and amortization maintenance capital expenditures gross cash flow gross investment return on gross investment gross profit and sg a expenses for the management calculation of rogi have been adjusted to add back the amounts recorded in our second quarter related to the exit of our polysulfide based insulating glass product line in europe 
the rogi calculation for management measurement purposes uses a tax rate of percent 
the gaap rate is based on actual tax expense including any one time  discrete items 
maintenance capital expenditures used for the management calculation of rogi is percent of total depreciation expense whereas the gaap based amount is the actual capital expenditures from the cash flow statement

forward looking statements and risk factors the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements may be identified by the use of words like plan  expect  aim  believe  project  anticipate  intend  estimate  will  should  could including the negative or variations thereof and other expressions that indicate future events and trends 
these plans and expectations are based upon certain underlying assumptions  including those mentioned with the specific statements 
such assumptions are in turn based upon internal estimates and analyses of current market conditions and trends  our plans and strategies  economic conditions and other factors 
these plans and expectations and the assumptions underlying them are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in projecting future conditions and results 
actual results could differ materially from expectations expressed in the forward looking statements if one or more of the underlying assumptions and expectations proves to be inaccurate or is unrealized 
in addition to the factors described in this report  item a 
risk factors identifies some of the important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in any such forward looking statements 
in order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  we have identified these important factors which could affect our financial performance and could cause our actual results for future periods to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward looking statements 
these factors should be considered  together with any similar risk factors or other cautionary language that may be made elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the list of important factors in item a 
risk factors does not necessarily present in order of importance 
this disclosure  including that under forward looking statements and risk factors  and other forward looking statements and related disclosures made by us in this report and elsewhere from time to time  represents our best judgment as of the date the information is given 
we do not undertake responsibility for updating any of such information  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise  except as required by law 
investors are advised  however  to consult any further public company disclosures such as in filings with the sec or in our press releases on related subjects 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency rates and prices of raw materials 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
our financial performance has been  and may continue to be  negatively affected by unfavorable economic conditions 
continued or further recessionary economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our sales volumes  pricing levels and profitability 
as domestic and international economic conditions change  trends in discretionary consumer spending also become unpredictable and subject to reductions due to uncertainties about the future 
a general reduction in consumer discretionary spending due to a recession in the domestic and international economies  or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents interest rate risk exposure to changes in interest rates results primarily from borrowing activities used to fund operations 
committed floating rate credit facilities are used to fund a portion of operations 
we believe that probable near term changes in interest rates would not materially affect financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the annual impact on interest expense of a one percentage point interest rate change on the outstanding balance of our variable rate debt as of november  would be approximately million 
foreign exchange risk as a result of being a global enterprise  there is exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect operating results and financial condition 
approximately percent of net revenue was generated outside of the united states in principal foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  canadian dollar  australian dollar  british pound sterling  japanese yen  swiss franc  argentine peso  brazilian real  chilean peso  columbian peso  costa rican colones  chinese renminbi  indian rupee and honduran lempira 
our objective is to balance  where possible  local currency denominated assets to local currency denominated liabilities to have a natural hedge and minimize foreign exchange impacts 
we enter into cross border transactions through importing and exporting goods to and from different countries and locations 
these transactions generate foreign exchange risk as they create assets  liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the local currency 
this also applies to services provided and other cross border agreements among subsidiaries 
we take steps to minimize risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through normal operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative instruments 
we do not enter into any speculative positions with regard to derivative instruments 
from a sensitivity analysis viewpoint  based on financial results and foreign currency balance sheet positions as of november   a hypothetical overall percent change in the us dollar would have resulted in a change in net income of approximately million or per diluted share 
raw materials the principal raw materials used to manufacture products include resins  polymers  synthetic rubbers  vinyl acetate monomer and plasticizers 
we generally avoid sole source supplier arrangements for raw materials 
while alternate supplies of most key raw materials are available  unplanned supplier production outages may lead to strained supply demand situations for several key raw materials such as ethylene and propylene  several polymers and other petroleum derivatives such as waxes 
the purchase of raw materials is our largest expenditure 
our objective is to purchase raw materials that meet both our quality standards and production needs at the lowest total cost 
most raw materials are purchased on the open market or under contracts that limit the frequency but not the magnitude of price increases 
in some cases  however  the risk of raw material price changes is managed by strategic sourcing agreements which limit price increases to increases in supplier feedstock costs  while requiring decreases as feedstock costs decline 
the leverage of having substitute raw materials approved for use wherever possible is used to minimize the impact of possible price increases
