table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition 
this md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes in part ii  item of this report 
overview we design  develop and market a family of innovative technology based learning platforms  related proprietary content and learning toys primarily for infants and children through age nine  both at home and in schools around the world 
we have created more than interactive software titles for our platforms  covering subjects such as phonics  reading  writing and math 
in addition  we have a broad line of stand alone educational products  or learning toys  that do not require the separate purchase of software and are generally targeted at children from infancy through age five 
our products are available in five languages including queen s english and are sold globally through retailers  distributors  directly to consumers via the leapfrog 
com web store  and directly to schools 
we generate revenue from selling platform hardware  including our interactive reading systems  our mobile learning systems  and a range of learning toys 
we also generate revenue from the sale of a wide range of content for our platforms that we develop based on licensed characters or using leapfrog owned characters 
we introduced the learning path  a web based service that helps parents track what their children are learning with our web connected products  in the united states and canada in and in the united kingdom in early the learning path gives our consumers access to a variety of downloadable content and online rewards programs that encourage learning 
the learning path also makes it easier for our consumers to age up with our products 
parents are able to see the learning and gain personalized insight into their child s learning progress 
many of our products  including the tag and tag junior reading system  launched in and  respectively  the leapster and leapster explorer mobile learning systems  launched in and  respectively  my pal scout and my pal violet  also launched in  and my own leaptop  launched in are designed to connect to the learning path 
our products compete most directly in the toy industry in the preschool toy and electronic learning aids categories  both in the united states and in selected international markets 
the educational toy category continues to attract new entrants as well as new innovative products  and competition is significant 
our business is highly seasonal with a significant portion of our revenue occurring in the second half of the year 
given relatively low sales volumes in the first half of the year and the relatively fixed nature of many of our operating expenses  which occur fairly evenly throughout the year  our results of operations have historically been stronger in our third and fourth quarters relative to our first and second quarters 
conversely  our cash flow from operations tends to be highest in the first quarter of the year when we collect the majority of our accounts receivable related to the prior year s fourth quarter sales 
cash flow from operations generally tends to be lowest in our third quarter  as accounts receivables collections taper off and we build inventory in preparation for the fourth quarter holiday season 
the reduction in cash flow in the third quarter generally means that our available cash is at its lowest point for the year in the first month of the fourth quarter 
although sales in the fourth quarter have historically been higher than any other quarter  this pattern differed in as a result of the global economic crisis 
as retailers reacted to sharply declining consumer spending  our sales for the fourth quarter of were significantly below our expectations and constituted a substantially smaller percentage of our annual sales than fourth quarter sales had in previous years 
fourth quarter net sales in made up only of total net sales for the year 
in and  we returned to our normal seasonal pattern with fourth quarter net sales making up and of total net sales for the years  respectively 

table of contents in addition  weak retail consumer spending in the fourth quarter of generated unusually high retail inventory levels  which had an adverse impact on net sales for the first three quarters of given the seasonality of our business  declines in sales in the third and fourth quarters generally have a disproportionate impact on our annual operating results for that year and for cash flows from operations at the beginning of the following year due to higher than anticipated retailer inventory levels 
stronger consumer demand during the fourth quarter of resulted in low retail inventory levels at the end of we believe that these low inventory levels had a positive effect on the year over year growth in net sales in however  despite some signs of modest economic recovery  we still face significant risk associated with reduced consumer spending  especially in light of a sustained decline in consumer confidence 
retailers continued to exhibit conservative ordering patterns in  particularly in light of the relatively low retail inventory levels at the beginning of  and we have continued to offer discounts and coupons to help drive consumer sales and may have to continue to offer such incentives for  which could negatively impact our gross margin 
the potential business risk for us from potential macroeconomic conditions in on our financial results and operations is discussed further in part i 
item a 
risk factors weakness in the current economic environment could have a material adverse effect on our sales  and a slow recovery could prevent us from achieving our financial goals in and beyond  retailer liquidity problems could harm our liquidity and financial results  and our liquidity may be insufficient to meet the long term or periodic needs of our business 
we significantly reduced our cost structure to remain competitive in a historically severe economic environment in for example  during the second quarter of  we sublet a portion of our headquarter facilities in emeryville  california  and during the fourth quarter of  we consolidated the administrative operations and terminated several senior level employees in the united states  france and the united kingdom 
in  we have benefitted from reduced selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses as a result of the actions taken in and during the fourth quarter of  we terminated several employees in the united states and we entered into a lease amendment with our landlord and terminated the lease of a portion of our headquarter facilities in emeryville  california prior to the end of the contracted term 
as a result  we expect to benefit from a further decline in sg a expenses beginning in we intend to continue to focus our spending resources on building out our core product lines and improving the marketability and scope of our content library 
we invest in research and development of existing and new lines of business that we believe will contribute to our long term growth and profitability 
for example  we continue to invest in developing new hardware platforms and content based on the latest relevant technologies that impact both offline and online play experiences 
we believe delivering innovative and high value experiences that are fun and that facilitate learning in children who play with our products is the key to our future growth 
our strategic priorities for are to invest in the core categories of interactive reading  mobile learning and our learning toy lines as well as in our growing online capabilities 
in this regard  we expect to continue to develop downloadable leaning applications across multiple platforms and further expand and leverage the learning path 
we plan to focus our marketing on increasing consumer sales in each of our core product lines  platforms and contents  and building growth in the children s learning toy category 
we organize  operate and assess our business in two primary operating segments us and international

gross margin for declined as compared to as a result of the decrease of five percentage points in the international segment  which was offset by the increase of one percentage point in the us segment 
operating expenses for increased as compared to  primarily due to an increase in advertising to support the launch of leapster explorer and to build consumer awareness of the tag reading system 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in sg a expenses driven by lower compensation related costs as a result of lower average headcount in income from operations of million for increased by million as compared to the improvement was primarily driven by an increase in net sales and offset by modest operating expense increases in as compared to our basic and diluted net income per share of for increased by per share as compared to the net loss in included a one time favorable tax benefit of million  or per share  in connection with the release of tax reserves based on expired statutes of limitations 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales for declined as compared to the decline was driven primarily by the high year end retail inventory levels and depressed consumer spending due to the weakened economy  which led to lower shipments for the first three quarters of the year end retail inventory levels impacted all business lines  but had the most profound impact on the mobile learning business  including both platforms and software related content 
net sales for included a negative impact from changes in currency exchanges rates of one percentage point 
gross margin improved two percentage points in to as a result of a higher proportion of sales of high margin products and reductions in sales returns allowances due lower retail inventory levels and the fact that we had no charges in related to the consumer product safety improvement act as compared to in addition  we reduced our allowance for defective products  as claims have trended lower than expected 
these increases were offset in part by increased use of discounting and promotions in 
table of contents operating expenses decreased in as compared to  primarily due to reduced headcount  reductions in advertising  and lower bad debt expense 
the number of total fulltime employees declined  or  from december  to december   due to a combination of reductions in force and the migration of certain aspects of our product development cycle to external parties

the weighted average of basic and diluted common shares outstanding remained relatively level 
outlook we expect continued modest economic improvement in however  high retail inventory levels as of december  may adversely impact sales to our retailers  thereby reducing our net sales in the first half of as compared to offsetting the affect of high beginning retail inventory  we believe additional factors  such as our ability to leverage and grow our learning path  new product introductions across all categories  international expansion opportunities  and development and distribution of leapfrog branded digital content should positively impact our operating income in further  we expect to continue operating at our lower cost structure  which should also contribute to improved operating income in further  our expectations for operating income are subject to many uncertainties  including the timing and strength of any economic recovery and many other factors described in the risk factors set forth in part i risk factors in item a of this form k  there can be no assurance that consumer demand for our products will improve in compared to operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses consist primarily of salaries and related employee benefits  including stock based compensation expense and other headcount related expenses associated with executive management  finance  information technology  supply chain  facilities  human resources  other administrative headcount  legal and other professional fees  indirect selling expenses  systems costs  rent  office equipment and supplies

fiscal year compared to fiscal year advertising expenses declined in as compared to the decrease was primarily as a result of our continued focus on efficient spending  given the expected net sales decline and fewer key product launches

the other  net category improved considerably as the fair value of our investment in ars stabilized during the year  resulting in significantly lower impairment charges

the decline in advertising expense was driven by a reduction in television based advertising and fewer new platform launches as compared to bad debt expense declined million as the worldwide economy began to stabilize and fewer international retailers encountered liquidity problems or declared bankruptcy compared to income loss from operations improved significantly in as compared to as the gross margin improvement and significant decrease in operating expenses offset the decrease in net sales 
liquidity and capital resources financial condition cash and cash equivalents totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash balance was due to inventory purchasing to support expected sales demand as well as timelier payments to our suppliers resulting in a significantly lower accounts payable balance 
as of december   we did not have any cash equivalents 
as of december   we held million  stated at fair value  in long term investments in ars 
due to the illiquidity of these investments  we have not included and do not intend  for the foreseeable future  to include them as potential sources of liquidity in our future cash flow projections 
thus  we do not anticipate that future declines in value  if any  will have an adverse impact on our future ability to support operations and meet our obligations as they come due 
we have an asset backed revolving credit facility  which is discussed in more detail below  with a potential borrowing availability of million 
there were no borrowings outstanding on this line of credit at december  our accumulated deficit of million at december  is not expected to have an impact on our future ability to operate  given our anticipated cash flows from operations and the availability of our credit facility 
future capital expenditures are primarily planned for new product development and purchases related to the upgrading of our information technology capabilities 
we expect that capital expenditures in  including those for capitalized content and website development costs  will be funded with cash flows generated by operations 
capital expenditures were million  including a million purchase of intangible assets  million  including a million purchase of intangible assets  and million in  and  respectively 
we believe that cash on hand  cash flow from operations and amounts available under our revolving credit facility will provide adequate funds for our foreseeable working capital needs and planned capital expenditures over the next twelve months 
our ability to fund our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures  as well as our ability to comply with all of the financial covenants of our credit facility  depend on our future operating performance and cash flows  which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions

dollars in millions cash flows provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents fiscal year compared to fiscal year net cash used in operating activities for increased million  as compared to  primarily due to a significantly higher inventory level purchased to support expected sales demand  and a decrease in associated accounts payable due to timelier payments  offset partially by increased cash collected from our accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities increased million  or  for as compared to  primarily due to a million purchase of intangible assets related to the technology used in our tag reading system 
the remaining increase is primarily related to various computer hardware and software upgrades and maintenance  as well as new software purchases to further automate processes and better support operations 
net cash provided by financing activities improved million for as compared to  primarily due to an increase in employee stock option exercises in response to a higher average company stock price during as compared to fiscal year compared to fiscal year net cash flow from operations in declined million from as a result of a higher proportion of net sales in the fourth quarter of  and the relative timing of sales within the fourth quarter 
net sales in the fourth quarter of increased over the same period of  with a significant portion of the sales occurring later in the quarter compared to the same period of while net inventory declined million as a result of the stronger fourth quarter sales and effective production management  net accounts receivable increased million 
given that a majority of the sales occurred later in the quarter  a larger proportion of sales were not due until as compared to sales at the end of net cash flow used in investing activities decreased million in driven by reductions in capital expenditures  principally property and equipment and capitalized content  as well as proceeds received from the sale of part of our investment in ars 

table of contents seasonal patterns of cash provided by used in operations the table below shows our seasonal patterns of cash flow provided by used in operations by quarter for the fiscal years ended december   and dollars in millions st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter total  net for fiscal year with the exception of and  our cash flow from operations have generally been highest in the first quarter of the year when we collected the majority of our accounts receivable booked in the fourth quarter of the prior year 
in and  quarterly cash flows did not conform to this general pattern as a result of our tightened cash management practices in response to the economic crisis  leading to higher accounts payable balances 
thus  cash flow provided by operations was higher in the fourth quarter of and than in the first quarter of and  respectively 
cash flow used in operations tends to be highest in our third quarter  as collections from prior accounts receivables taper off and we invest heavily in inventory in preparation for the fourth quarter holiday season 
historically  cash flow generally turned positive again in the fourth quarter as we start to collect on the accounts receivables associated with the holiday season 
based on the shift in ordering patterns by retailers beginning in  which resulted in orders being placed significantly later in the year  cash flows from operations in the fourth quarter of were significantly lower than has historically been the case in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
as a result  we expect cash flows from operations in the first quarter of to be higher than previous years 
these seasonal patterns may vary depending upon general economic conditions and other factors 
line of credit and borrowing availability on august   we entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement for a million asset based revolving credit facility with bank of america  na and certain other financial institutions 
we have granted a security interest in substantially all of our assets to the lenders as security for our obligations under the facility 
provided there is no default under the loan agreement and subject to availability of additional credit  we may elect  without the consent of any of the lenders  to increase the size of the credit facility under the loan agreement up to an aggregate of million 
this credit facility superseded and replaced our previous million credit facility  dated november   which would have otherwise expired in november and was terminated as of august  in connection with signing the amended and restated loan and security agreement 
the borrowing availability varies according to the levels of our accounts receivable and cash and investment securities deposited in secured accounts with the lenders 
subject to the level of this borrowing base  we may make and repay borrowings from time to time until the maturity of the facility 
the interest rate is  at our election  bank of america  na s prime rate or base rate or a libor rate defined in the loan agreement  plus  in each case  an applicable margin 
the applicable margin for a loan depends on the average daily availability for the most recent fiscal quarter and the type of loan 
availability under this agreement was million as of december  
table of contents the loan agreement contains customary events of default  including for payment failures  failure to comply with covenants  failure to satisfy other obligations under the credit agreement or related documents  defaults in respect of other indebtedness  bankruptcy  insolvency and inability to pay debts when due  change in control provisions  and the invalidity of guaranty or security agreements 
if any event of default under the loan agreement occurs  the lenders may terminate their respective commitments  declare immediately due all borrowings under the facility and foreclose on the collateral 
a cross default provision applies if a default occurs on other indebtedness in excess of million and the applicable grace period in respect of the indebtedness has expired  such that the lender of  or trustee for  the defaulted indebtedness has the right to accelerate 
we are also required to maintain a ratio of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to fixed charges  or ebitda  as defined in the loan agreement  of at least to when the covenant is required to be tested 
the ratio is measured only if certain borrowing availability thresholds are not met 
during the fourth quarter of  we borrowed a total of million on the line with an interest rate per annum of through the final repayment date  and repaid the full amount during the same quarter from cash provided by operations 
we had no borrowings outstanding under this agreement at december  on january   we entered into an amendment to the agreement that  among other things i extends the maturity date of the agreement to august   ii reduces  starting january   the applicable interest rate margins to a range of to above the applicable base rate for base rate loans  as compared to above the applicable base rate in the original agreement  and to above the applicable libor rate for libor rate loans  as compared to above the applicable libor rate in the original agreement  in each case depending on our borrowing availability  and iii reduces  starting january   the unused line fee to per year if utilization of the line is greater than or equal to  and to per year if utilization of the line is less than  as compared to per year in the original agreement 
contractual obligations and commitments we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
we conduct our corporate operations from leased facilities under operating leases 
generally  these have initial lease periods of three to twelve years and contain provisions for renewal options of five years at market rates 
we account for rent expense on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations at december  payments due in total less than year years years more than years dollars in millions operating leases royalty guarantees total at december   we had no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under our asset backed line of credit facility with bank of america  na at december   we had million of potential availability on the line 
in addition  we had commitments to purchase inventory totaling approximately million at december  critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with gaap 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
we believe that certain accounting policies  which we refer to as critical 
table of contents accounting policies  are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the use of significant estimates and the application of significant judgment by our management 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  particularly those related to our critical accounting policies 
the following discussion highlights those policies and the underlying estimates and assumptions  which we consider critical to an understanding of the financial information in this report 
revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  and other accounts receivables and revenue reserves we derived the majority of our revenue from sales of our technology based learning products and related proprietary content 
revenue is recognized when products are shipped and title passes to the customer  provided that there is evidence of a commercial arrangement  delivery has occurred  there is a fixed or determinable fee and collection is reasonably assured 
for online content downloads  delivery is considered to occur when the download occurs 
for professional training services  delivery is considered to occur when the training is performed 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling costs are recognized as revenue 
costs incurred to ship merchandise from warehouse facilities are recorded in cost of sales 
net sales represent gross sales less estimated sales returns  allowances for defective products  promotional markdowns  charge backs and price changes  and cooperative promotional arrangements 
correspondingly  these allowances are recorded as reductions of gross accounts receivable 
we reduce gross accounts receivable balance by an allowance for amounts we believe may become uncollectible 
this allowance is an estimate based primarily on management s evaluation of the customer s financial condition in the context of current economic conditions  past collection history and aging of the accounts receivable balances 
determining such allowance requires judgment  the result of which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported in accounts receivable 
if changes in the economic climate or in the financial condition of any of our customers impair or improve their ability to make payments  adjustments to the allowances may be required 
we also provide estimated allowances against revenue and accounts receivable for sales returns  defective products  promotional markdowns  charge backs and price changes  and cooperative promotional arrangements in the same period that the related revenue is recorded 
the allowances are estimated utilizing historical information  maximum known exposures and other available information including current retailer inventory levels  sell through of its retailers and distributors  current trends in retail for its products  changes in customer demand for its products and other related factors 
accounts receivable are reported on the balance sheet net of all provided allowances  which included the allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value  on a first in  first out basis 
we record inventory costs on the balance sheet based on third party contract manufacturer invoices  which include the contract manufacturers costs for materials  labor and manufacturing overhead related to our products 
inventory valuation primarily requires estimation of slow moving  obsolete or excess products 
our estimate of the write downs for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventories is based on management s review of on hand inventories compared to their estimated future usage  product demand forecast  anticipated product selling prices  the expected product lifecycle  and products planned for discontinuation 
if actual future usage  demand for our products and anticipated product selling prices were less favorable than those projected by our management  additional inventory write downs would be required resulting in a negative impact on our gross margin 
we monitor the estimates of inventory write downs on a quarterly basis 
when considered necessary  we make additional adjustments to reduce inventory to its net realizable value  with corresponding increases to cost of sales 
inventories included write downs for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventories of million and million at december  and  respectively 

table of contents capitalization of product costs we capitalize certain external costs related to the development of content for our learning products  including design  artwork  animation  layout  editing  voice  audio and software included in the learning products 
such costs are capitalized once the technological feasibility of the product is established and costs are determined to be recoverable 
amortization of these costs begins when the products are initially released for sale and continues over a two year life using the straight line method  and is included in cost of sales 
we evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized amounts periodically and recognize write downs of these amounts in the statements of operations as needed 
capitalized content costs that are cancelled  abandoned or otherwise deemed impaired are charged to cost of sales in the period of cancellation 
our evaluation in identified capitalized costs related to several platforms that had been discontinued  while the evaluation resulted in minor impairments and evaluation identified capitalized costs related to several platforms that had been retired or discontinued 
accordingly  we accelerated the amortization of these costs  resulting in an increase in cost of sales in the us segment of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we also capitalize external website development costs website costs  which primarily include third party costs related to developing applications that are an integral component of certain products we market  as well as costs incurred to develop or acquire and customize code for web applications  costs to develop html web pages or develop templates  and costs to create initial graphics for the website that included the design or layout of each page 
website costs are amortized on a straight line basis over two years 
we evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized website costs periodically and if an impairment loss is considered to have occurred during the period  we accelerate the amortization and record it in depreciation and amortization in the statement of operations in the same period 
our evaluations of capitalized content development costs and website costs require us to make complex and subjective judgments  using currently available data as well as projections about the potential impact of possible future events and conditions  which judgments and projections are inherently uncertain 
if future events and conditions do not meet expectations  we make additional adjustments to reduce the expected realizable value of the assets  with corresponding increases to cost of sales 
capitalized content development costs and website costs are both included in capitalized product costs on the balance sheet  net of accumulated amortization 
goodwill and other intangible assets we review goodwill for impairment at least annually  and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that warrant a review 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors or operating performance indicators 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires significant judgment  including identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  determination of the fair value of each reporting unit  and projections of future net cash flows  which projections are inherently uncertain 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow methodology 
the market approach requires considerable judgment in selecting comparable companies and estimating the multiples of revenue implied by their market values 
the discounted cash flow methodology requires management to exercise judgment in selecting an appropriate discount rate and to make numerous assumptions in order to develop future business and financial forecasts and the related estimates of future net cash flows 
future net cash flows depend primarily on future sales of our products  which are inherently difficult to predict 
this is especially true when a significant portion of our future net sales is expected to be generated by both mature products as well as products introduced in and planned to be introduced in after analyzing our goodwill at december  and  we concluded no impairment charge was required in either period 
at december  and we had million and million of goodwill and other intangible assets  respectively 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
we calculate our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the determination of our income tax assets  liabilities and expense requires us to make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax benefits  tax credits and deductions 
significant changes in these estimates or variations in the actual outcome of expected future tax consequences may result in material increases or decreases in the tax provision or benefit in subsequent periods 
we provide valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
determination of whether or not a valuation allowance is warranted requires consideration of many factors  including prior earnings history  expected future earnings  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
our financial statements also include accruals for the estimated amounts of probable future assessments that may result from the examination of federal  state or international tax returns 
our tax accruals  tax provision  deferred tax assets or income tax liabilities may be adjusted if there are changes in circumstances  such as changes in tax law  tax audits or other factors  which may cause management to revise its estimates 
the amounts ultimately paid on any future assessments may differ from the amounts accrued and may result in an increase or reduction to the effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
such adjustments could have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the applicable vesting period of the stock award generally four years using the straight line method 
determining the fair value of stock based compensation awards at grant date requires significant judgment and estimates regarding valuation variables such as volatility  expected forfeiture rates and the expected term of the awards 
stock based compensation expense may be significantly affected by changes in our stock price  our actual forfeiture rates and the extent of future grants of equity awards 
if actual results differ significantly from our estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected
