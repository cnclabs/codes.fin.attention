offsetting these decreases  were incremental data management expense of  plus patient enrollment related costs of  leading up to the close out of trial enrollment in september interest expense interest expense decreased  to  in from  in the decrease is principally attributable to lower term and promissory note interest associated with the repayment of these loans in february  lower loan related fees and lower deferred financing expense due to the write off of a portion of the outstanding deferred financing balance in connection with the payoff of the term loan 
these decreases were partially offset by higher line of credit interest attributable to higher borrowing levels and interest rates 
loss on extinguishment of debt in connection with the payoff of our term loan in february  we recorded a charge of  representing the then unamortized portion of the deferred financing costs relating to the term loan 
other income other income increased  to  in from  in the main drivers for the net year to year increase was an exchange gain of  higher royalty income of  and lower state related franchise and minimum taxes of  partially offset by lower miscellaneous income of  principally associated with the non recurrence of gains on miscellaneous asset sales associated with the closure of the first aid product manufacturing operation in income taxes we recorded a  income tax provision for consisting of a  current foreign tax provision and a  deferred tax provision consisting of a  deferred tax provision related to the amortization of goodwill for tax and not financial reporting purposes  partially offset by a  foreign tax benefit based on our canadian subsidiary s operating results 
no tax benefit was recorded for our united states or united kingdom operations in due to uncertainty surrounding our ability to use available net operating loss carry forwards and net deferred tax assets

due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to use our united states and united kingdom net operating loss carry forwards and net deferred tax assets  a full valuation allowance for the united states and united kingdom net deferred tax assets has been provided 
net loss we generated a net loss of  or per share basic and diluted  in compared to a net loss of  or per share basic and diluted  in liquidity and capital resources cash flow and working capital at december  and december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and  respectively 
the  increase in cash reflects net cash provided by financing activities of  partially offset by cash used in investing activities of  and operating activities of  together with the exchange rate effect of  net cash used in operating activities of  stems from  cash provided from operations net loss plus non cash items  together with  cash used from the net change in operating assets and liabilities 
higher receivables and inventory  offset by higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities  were the main drivers behind the net cash used in connection with the net change in operating assets and liabilities 
the increase in receivables reflects a higher level of current sales  addition of receivables related to the international business and the final payoff of rebates owed in connection with the discontinuation of a significant rebate program 
the increase in inventory reflects a build up to support new products  addition of the international business and improved customer service levels in certain segments of our business 
the increase in accounts payable reflects the addition of the international business and higher overall spending levels 
the increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities principally reflects higher canadian rebates due to higher sales  accrued foreign taxes payable associated with canada s profitable operating results  higher accrued royalties payable due to higher sales of royalty bearing products and accrued sales incentives payable due to an increase in the magnitude of the underlying incentive programs 
net cash used in investing activities of  reflects  cash used to purchase the worldwide medihoney license rights and capital expenditures of  net cash provided by financing activities of  reflects net proceeds of  from the sale of stock in connection with a secondary public offering completed in february and the exercise of stock options   from funds previously restricted  and  from an increase in borrowing under the line of credit 
offsetting these inflows were  in debt payments consisting of regularly scheduled debt repayments  together with the full payment of the balances of our term loan and our promissory note 
working capital increased  at december  to  from  at december  this increase principally reflects the cash infusion associated with the public offering completed in february management believes that this level of working capital is sufficient to support ongoing operations 
in february  we reported positive top line results for our dsc phase ii trial in patients with diabetic foot ulcers 
the news was well received in the investment community and resulted in a significant increase in our share price and daily trading levels 
since the date of the announcement  we have received  from the exercise of warrants 
we believe the positive results surrounding the dsc phase ii trial will improve our ability to raise equity going forward as circumstances warrant 
based on current forecasts  a  medihoney sales related milestone payment is anticipated in the next twelve months 
financing arrangements with cash on hand of  together with available cash under our line of credit of  we had  of available liquidity at december   versus  at december  in february  we raised  net of commission and other offering expenses from the sale in a secondary public offering of shares of our common stock 
these proceeds  together with  of previously restricted cash  were used to acquire the worldwide medihoney licensing rights for  pay off the outstanding united states term loan of  and pay off our  promissory note due april   leaving  of the net proceeds available for general working capital purposes 
payment of the foregoing indebtedness has had a positive impact on cash flow by eliminating associated debt service 
in march  our united states lender modified the terms of our five year revolving credit and security agreement to take into account the payment of the term loan 
the existing financial covenants were replaced with twelve month rolling fixed charge coverage and total debt coverage covenants 
the lender also reduced the minimum three month libor rate from to and authorized the payment of our  unsecured promissory note  which was paid in march in addition  the minimum excess availability reserve was reduced from  to  thereby increasing our borrowing availability by  prospective assessment our strategic objective is to in license  develop and launch novel higher margin advanced wound care products while utilizing our core business to the extent possible to fund this objective 
in addition  we will continue to evaluate external opportunities to leverage our core capabilities for growth 
to the extent we determine that we cannot finance our growth initiatives internally  we will evaluate the feasibility of doing so via the sale of equity and or jointly developing products with third parties 
the launch of a number of new products in recent years bodes well for the future growth of our higher margined advanced wound care products both domestically and abroad 
we continue to work on our pipeline and have identified several product line extensions and new products that are capable of contributing to future sales growth 
we believe that the first aid products line continues to represent a growth opportunity 
sales for our traditional wound care and skincare product lines are expected to remain relatively stable 
our strategy for growth is assuming the existing resources in place are generating the expected return  we will continue to expand our worldwide investment in sales and marketing resources in support of our higher margined advanced wound care products 
in february  we licensed the worldwide rights to medihoney 
this will serve as the catalyst for the expansion of our international business 
we have established a direct presence in europe and  ultimately  will serve other areas of the world employing a direct presence or distributor model as the basis for conducting business  as circumstances dictate 
in february  we announced the top line efficacy data for our dsc phase ii trial that were very positive and exceeded our expectations 
the news was well received in the medical and investment communities 
we expect to complete the study and file our report with the fda by the end of september the estimated cost to complete the phase ii trial is  coupled with the  spent through december   the total cost of the trial is projected to be  these costs are net of the  grant received from the united states government in november under the patient protection and affordable care act to assist in financing the trial 
while the launch of dsc is several years away  we believe the market potential for this product for diabetic foot ulcers and the other indications that we have the rights to are significant 
the final results of the phase ii trial for diabetic foot ulcers will determine the efficacy and safety of the product and further refine its market potential 
the cost of the phase iii trial and bringing the product to market are expected to be in the range of to million 
should we decide to proceed with the dsc development plan for diabetic foot ulcers after completion of phase ii  we plan to fund the additional development costs via a joint venture  out of available cash flow or the sale of equity 
alternatively  we may determine to sublicense or sell the rights to the compound 
the first aid products business represents a growth opportunity 
in addition to its core business opportunities  the first aid products business will serve as a platform for introducing our existing advanced and traditional wound care products to new customers and markets  especially the retail market 
we continue to work on completion of a cost effective supply chain for first aid products 
the supply chain is expected to be fully operational within the next six months  at which time we expect to be able to begin to improve liquidity by reducing the level of inventory required to support the business 
with the planned improvement in operations and expected working capital requirements  together with the available cash on hand and available borrowing capacity as of december   we anticipate having sufficient liquidity in place to meet our operating needs and debt covenants for the foreseeable future 
further  if needed  we believe the positive results surrounding the dsc phase ii trial for diabetic foot ulcers will improve our ability to raise equity going forward 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq capital market under the symbol dsci

critical accounting policies estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of sales deductions for trade rebates  sales incentives  discounts and allowances 
significant estimates and assumptions are also required in determining the appropriateness of amortization periods for identifiable intangible assets  the potential impairment of goodwill and the valuation of inventory 
some of these judgments can be subjective and complex and  consequently  actual results may differ from these estimates 
for any individual estimate or assumption made by us  there may also be other reasonable estimates or assumptions 
we believe  however  that given current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows for the periods presented 
our most critical accounting policies were discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors and are described below 
revenue recognition and adjustments to revenue we sell our products through our own direct sales force and through independent distributors and manufacturers representatives 
the primary end users of our products are nursing homes  hospitals  clinics and home healthcare agencies 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured  which is generally at the time of shipment or receipt by our customers  depending on the terms of the related sales or distribution agreement 
when we recognize revenue from the sale of our products  we simultaneously adjust revenue for estimated trade rebates and distribution fees in canada  and estimates of returns and allowances  cash discounts and other sales incentives 
a trade rebate represents the difference between the invoice price to the wholesaler distributor and the end user s contract price 
these rebates are estimated monthly based on historical experience  distributor rebate submission trends  estimated distributor inventory levels  and existing contract sales terms with our distributors and end users 
we have a contract with our exclusive canadian distributor and we pay a fixed fee based on sales subject to the fee as defined for distribution services in canada 
because the services performed by the distributor cannot be separated from the purchase of our products by the distributor  we treat this distribution fee as a reduction of revenue 
the distribution fee is accrued monthly based on net sales to the distributor multiplied by the ratio of recent historical distributor fee expense to net sales 
the percentage of distributor fee expense to net sales is re evaluated quarterly for reasonableness 
sales incentives represent credits granted to specific customers based on attainment of pre determined sales objectives 
sales incentives are accrued monthly in accordance with the terms of the underlying sales incentive agreement and actual customer sales 
sales incentive agreements are generally for a period of one year 
we provide our customers certain limited return rights and we have a formal returned goods policy that guides the disposition of returns with our customers 
we accrue for sales returns and allowances and cash discounts monthly based on current sales and historical activity 
we do not offer our customers price protection rights or concessions 
returns were approximately of gross sales in both and we continually monitor the factors that influence rebates and fees  returns and allowances  and other discounts and sales incentives and make adjustments as necessary 
goodwill at december   we had  of goodwill consisting of  relating to the first aid products acquisition in november and  relating to the western medical acquisition in april we assess the impairment of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
the assessment is performed using the two step process required by accounting guidance relating to goodwill 
the first step is a review for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
for and  the first step of our goodwill impairment test reflected a fair value in excess of the carrying value of our reporting units 
accordingly  we did not perform the second step of this test during these periods 
the cash generating unit level or reporting unit at which we test goodwill for impairment is the operating segment level 
we have three operating segments wound care  wound closure and specialty securement devices and skin care 
products are allocated to each segment based on the nature and intended use of the product 
all of our goodwill has been allocated to the wound care segment as the business acquisitions which gave rise to the goodwill were wound care businesses 
for and and consistent with prior periods  we estimated the fair value of our wound care segment using the income approach  where we use a discounted cash flow model dcf in preparing our goodwill impairment assessment 
this approach calculates fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these after tax cash flows to a present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
we selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets 
significant estimates used in the fair value calculation include i estimates of future revenue and expense growth  ii future estimated effective tax rates  iii future estimated capital expenditures  iv future required investments in working capital  v average cost of capital  and vi the terminal value of the reporting unit 
the amount and timing of future cash flows within our dcf analysis is based on our five year forecast 
beyond our five year forecast we assumed a terminal value to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our dcf analysis 
annual revenue growth rates in our dcf model reflect expected growth in our advanced wound care products as well as growth in the products which we gained access to when we acquired first aid products in november of and western medical in  as we introduce these products across our existing customer base 
the weighted average cost of capital used to discount cash flows for the annual goodwill impairment test was estimated to be 
over time  our wound care segment has become an increasingly significant portion of our overall business 
for the year ended december   our wound care segment accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue 
given the significance of this segment to our overall results  we also look to our publicly traded market value  which we may adjust in consideration of an appropriate control premium  as an indicator of the fair value of our wound care segment and the reasonableness of our dcf model 
there have been no substantial changes to the methodology employed  significant assumptions or calculations applied in the first step of the goodwill impairment test over the past several years 
inventory the company writes down the value of inventory by the estimate of the difference between the cost of the inventory and its net realizable value 
the estimate takes into account projected sales of the inventory on hand and the age of the inventory in stock 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the provision for the write down of inventory is recorded in cost of sales 
stock based compensation we record compensation expense associated with stock options and other equity based compensation based on the fair value at the grant date and recognized over the requisite service periods 
we estimate the fair value of stock options as of the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model for service and performance based awards  and the binomial lattice pricing model for market based awards 
we use the quoted market price for restricted stock grants 
significant judgment and the use of estimates to value the equity based compensation  particularly surrounding black scholes or binomial lattice pricing model assumptions such as stock price volatility and expected option lives  are made by us
