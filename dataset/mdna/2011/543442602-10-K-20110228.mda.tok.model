critical accounting policies and estimates our financial condition and results of operations are based upon certain critical accounting policies  which include estimates  assumptions  and judgments on the part of management 
we base our estimates on various factors and information which may include  but are not limited to  history and prior experience  experience of other enterprises in the same industry  new related events  current economic conditions and information from third party professionals that is believed to be reasonable under the circumstance  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the following discussion highlights those policies and the underlying estimates and assumptions  which we consider critical to an understanding of the financial information in this report 
use of estimates and assumptions the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
this requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
table of contents that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue  expenses  and contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on various factors and information which may include  but are not limited to  history and prior experience  experience of other enterprises in the same industry  new related events  and current economic conditions and information from third party professionals that is believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
investments we invest our excess cash primarily in debt instruments of high quality corporate and government issuers 
all highly liquid instruments with maturities at the date of purchase greater than ninety days are considered investments 
all instruments with maturities greater than one year from the balance sheet date are considered long term investments unless management intends to liquidate such securities in the current operating cycle 
such securities are classified as short term investments 
these securities are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value 
changes in value of these investments are primarily related to changes in interest rates and are considered to be temporary in nature 
except for declines in fair value that are not considered temporary  net unrealized gains or losses on these investments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
we recognize realized gains and losses upon sale of investments using the specific identification method 
fair value of financial instruments our estimates of fair value for assets and liabilities is based on a framework that establishes a hierarchy of the inputs used in valuation and gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available 
the disclosure of fair value estimates is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable 
in determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed  the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect our significant market assumptions 
the three levels of the hierarchy are as follows level unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to access 
level quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets  or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable eg  interest rates  yield curves  default rates  etc 
or can be corroborated by observable market data 
level valuations based on models where significant inputs are not observable 
the unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use 
revenue recognition our online search advertising revenue is primarily composed of per click fees that we charge customers 
the per click fee charged for keyword targeted listings is calculated based on the results of online bidding for keywords or page content  up to a maximum cost per keyword or page content set by the customer 
revenue also includes revenue share from licensing of private labeled versions of our adcenter platform 
revenues associated with online advertising products  including advertiser networks  are generally recognized once collectability is established  delivery of services has occurred  all performance obligations have 
table of contents been satisfied  and no refund obligations exist 
we pay distribution network partners based on clicks on the advertiser s ad that are displayed on the websites of these distribution network partners 
these payments are called traffic acquisition costs tac and are included in cost of revenue 
the revenue derived from these arrangements that involve traffic supplied by distribution network partners is reported gross of the payment to the distribution network partners 
this revenue is reported gross due to the fact that we are the primary obligor to the advertisers who are the customers of the advertising service 
we also enter into agreements to provide private labeled versions of our products  including licenses to the adcenter platform technology 
these license arrangements may include some or all of the following elements revenue sharing based on the publisher s customers monthly revenue generated through the adcenter application  upfront fees  minimum monthly fees  and other license fees 
we recognize upfront fees over the term of the arrangement or the expected period of performance  other license fees over the term of the license  and revenue sharing portions over the period in which such revenue is earned 
in all cases  revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service is performed  and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we provide a provision against revenue for estimated reductions resulting from billing adjustments and customer refunds 
the amounts of these provisions are evaluated periodically based upon customer experience and historical trends 
deferred revenue is recorded when payments are received in advance of performance in underlying agreements 
customer deposits are recorded when customers make prepayments for online advertising 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customers failing to make required payments 
this valuation allowance is reviewed on a periodic basis to determine whether a provision or reversal is required 
the review is based on factors including the application of historical collection rates to current receivables and economic conditions 
we will record an increase or reduction of the allowance for doubtful accounts if collection rates or economic conditions are more or less favorable than we anticipated 
additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances  if economic conditions are less favorable than we anticipated or for customer specific circumstances  such as bankruptcy 
concentrations  credit risk and credit risk evaluation concentration of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents  investments  and accounts receivable 
as of december  and december   we placed our cash equivalents and investments through one financial institution  city national bank cnb  and mitigated the concentration of credit risk by placing percentage limits on the maximum portion of the investment portfolio which may be invested in any one investment instrument 
these amounts at times may exceed federally insured limits 
we have not experienced any credit losses on these cash equivalents and investment accounts and do not believe we are exposed to any significant credit risk on these funds 
the fair value of these accounts is subject to fluctuation based on market prices 
credit risk  customer and vendor evaluation accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from sales to customers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for estimated credit losses 
we apply judgment as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables based primarily on our evaluation of the customer s financial condition and past collection history and record a specific allowance 
in addition  we record an allowance based on the length of time the receivables are past due 
historically  such losses have been within our expectations 

table of contents revenue concentrations our largest category of customers are a small number of intermediaries  one of which may represent or more of revenue at any given time 
these intermediaries purchase clicks to sell into the affiliate networks of the large search engine providers 
for the years ended december  and  iac search and media iac  accounted for and  respectively  of net revenue and and  respectively  of publisher solutions revenue 
on may   iac notified us that it did not intend to renew the may adcenter license  hosting and support agreement  which provides for certain publisher solutions services the agreement upon its expiration 
the agreement  as amended  was scheduled to expire by its terms on december   but was extended in one month intervals through october  and expired on that date 
in addition  advertiser network revenue was derived from iac under separate distribution agreements  accounting for and of advertising network revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively  which were terminated in october impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets held or used in operations  including property and equipment and internally developed software  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
subject assets are tested for impairment at the lowest level of operations that generates cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows from those of other groups of assets and liabilities 
we have determined that the equity of our single reporting unit to be the lowest level of operation at which independent cash flows could be identified 
an impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount 
impairment  if any  is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to dispose 
in  purchased technology of million was fully impaired because an associated initiative was discontinued 
as of december   there was no impairment of long lived assets 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows computer equipment to years furniture and fixtures to years software to years leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease term 
when assets are retired or otherwise disposed of  the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective accounts  and any gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in operating expenses 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
expenditures that substantially increase an asset s useful life are capitalized 
internal use software development costs we capitalize external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing and obtaining internal use computer software and the payroll and payroll related costs of employees who devote time to developing internal use computer software 

table of contents we exercise judgment in determining when costs related to a project may be capitalized  in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs  and in determining the amortization period for the capitalized costs  which is generally years 
we expect to continue to invest in internally developed software and to capitalize such costs 
restructuring charges we have recorded restructuring charges related to closing of certain leased facilities and severance costs related to workforce reductions 
our judgment is required when estimating when the redundant facilities will be subleased and at what rate they will be subleased 
traffic acquisition costs we enter into agreements of varying durations with our distribution network partners that display our listings ads on their sites in return for a percentage of the revenue per click that we receive when the ads are clicked on those partners sites 
we also enter into agreements of varying durations with third party affiliates 
these affiliate agreements provide for variable payments based on a percentage of our revenue or based on a certain metric  such as number of searches or paid clicks 
tac expense is recorded in cost of revenue  and is based on a percentage of revenue 
advertising costs advertising costs are charged to sales and marketing expenses as incurred 
product development costs research and development of new product ideas and enhancements to existing products are charged to expense as incurred 
share based compensation we recognize share based compensation costs for all share based payment transactions  including grants of stock options and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan  over the requisite service period based on their relative fair values 
we estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the grant date using the black scholes method 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense in our consolidated statement of operations over the requisite service periods 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant in order to estimate the amount of share based awards that will ultimately vest 
the forfeiture rate is determined at the end of each fiscal quarter  based on historical rates 
we elected to adopt the alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of share based compensation to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee share based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and the consolidated statement of cash flows of the tax effects of employee share based compensation awards 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method 
under the liability method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation 
table of contents allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
we record liabilities  where appropriate  for all uncertain income tax positions 
we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within operations as income tax expense

in addition  unanticipated developments in the short term requiring cash payments  including the acquisition of businesses with negative cash flows  may necessitate additional financing 
we cannot be assured that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities  our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution
