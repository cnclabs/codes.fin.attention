item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
government regulation regarding the environment as a result of our manufacturing and assembly operations  our businesses are subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws  as well as other legal requirements relating to the generation  storage  transport and disposal of materials 
these laws include  without limitation  the resource conservation and recovery act  the clean air act  the clean water act and the comprehensive environmental response and compensation and liability act  and foreign equivalents of such laws 
we currently do not anticipate any materially adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations as a result of our compliance with federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws 
however  risk of environmental liability and charges associated with maintaining compliance with environmental laws is inherent in the nature of our manufacturing operations and there is no assurance that material liabilities or charges could not arise 
during the year ended december   we capitalized approximately million and expensed million related to environmental and safety control facilities 
for the year ending december  we expect to capitalize and expense million related to environmental and safety control facilities 
bankruptcy of leslie controls  inc on july   our leslie subsidiary filed a voluntary petition under chapter of the us bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the district of delaware the bankruptcy court and  simultaneously  filed a pre negotiated plan of reorganization as amended  the reorganization plan in an effort to permanently resolve leslie s asbestos liability and all current and future derivative claims against circor or its affiliates 
on october   the bankruptcy court entered an order confirming the reorganization plan which was later revised and re confirmed by the bankruptcy court to address certain objections  and  on february   the us federal district court for the district of delaware affirmed the bankruptcy court s order confirming the reorganization plan  thus clearing the way for leslie to emerge from bankruptcy

item a 
risk factors 
certain risk factors that may affect future results set forth below are certain risk factors that we believe are material to our stockholders 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations  and reputation could be harmed 
you should also consider these risk factors when you read forward looking statements elsewhere in this report 
you can identify forward looking statements by terms such as may  hope  should  expect  plan  anticipate  intend  believe  estimate  predict  potential  or continue  the negative of those terms or other comparable terminology 
forward looking statements are only predictions and can be adversely affected if any of the following risks occur 
table of contents some of our end markets are cyclical  which may cause us to experience fluctuations in revenues or operating results 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  fluctuations in revenues and operating results due to economic and business cycles 
we sell our products principally to oil  gas  petrochemical  process  power  aerospace  military  heating  ventilation and air conditioning hvac  maritime  pharmaceutical  and medical and instrumentation markets 
although we serve a variety of markets to avoid a dependency on any one  a significant downturn in any one of these markets could cause a material reduction in our revenues that could be difficult to offset 
in addition  decreased market demand typically results in excess manufacturing capacity among our competitors which  in turn  results in pricing pressure 
as a consequence  a significant downturn in our markets can result in lower profit margins 
in particular  our energy businesses are cyclical in nature as the worldwide demand for oil and gas fluctuates 
when worldwide demand for oil and gas is depressed  the demand for our products used in maintenance and repair of existing oil and gas applications  as well as exploration or new oil and gas project applications  is reduced 
as a result  we historically have generated lower revenues and profits in periods of declining demand for petrochemical products 
therefore  results of operations for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any future period 
future downturns or anticipated downturns in demand for oil and gas products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
similarly  although not to the same extent as the oil and gas markets  the aerospace  military and maritime markets have historically experienced cyclical fluctuations in demand that also could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we  along with our customers and vendors  face the uncertainty in the public and private credit markets and in general economic conditions in the united states and around the world 
the breadth  depth and duration of the volatility  disruption and general slowdown of the public and private capital and credit markets in the united states and around the world remains uncertain 
these conditions can adversely affect our revenue  results of operations and overall financial growth 
our business can be affected by a number of factors that are beyond our control such as general geopolitical  economic and business conditions and conditions in the financial services market  which each could materially impact our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  capital resources and liquidity 
additionally  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced funding to borrowers  including other financial institutions 
although we do not currently anticipate a need to access the credit markets for new financing in the short term  a prolonged constriction on future lending by banks or investors could result in higher interest rates on future debt obligations or could restrict our ability to obtain sufficient financing to meet our long term operational and capital needs or could limit our ability in the future to consummate strategic acquisitions 
the current uncertainty in the credit markets may also negatively impact the ability of our customers and vendors to finance their operations which  in turn  could result in a decline in our sales and in our ability to obtain necessary raw materials and components  thus potentially having an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents a resurgence of terrorist activity and or political instability around the world could cause economic conditions to deteriorate and adversely impact our businesses 
in the past  terrorist attacks have negatively impacted general economic  market and political conditions 
in particular  the terrorist attacks  compounded with changes in the national economy  resulted in reduced revenues in the aerospace and general industrial markets in years and although economic conditions have improved considerably  additional terrorist acts  acts of war or political instability wherever located around the world could cause damage or disruption to our business  our facilities or our employees which could significantly impact our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks  political instability  and other acts of war or hostility  including the current conflicts in iraq  afghanistan and the middle east  have created many economic and political uncertainties  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot presently be predicted 
in addition  with manufacturing facilities located worldwide  including facilities located in the united states  canada  western europe  the people s republic of china  morocco  brazil and india  we may be impacted by terrorist actions not only against the united states but in other parts of the world as well 
we are not insured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war for our aviation products 
if we cannot continue operating our manufacturing facilities at current or higher levels  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we operate a number of manufacturing facilities for the production of our products 
the equipment and management systems necessary for such operations may break down  perform poorly or fail  resulting in fluctuations in manufacturing efficiencies 
such fluctuations may affect our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
commencing in and continuing in  we embarked on a company wide program to implement lean manufacturing techniques as part of the circor business system 
we believe that this process will produce meaningful reductions in manufacturing costs 
however  implementation of these techniques may cause short term inefficiencies in production 
if we ultimately are unable to successfully implement these processes  our anticipated profitability may suffer 
we face significant competition in our markets and  if we are not able to respond to competition  our revenues may decrease 
we face significant competition from a variety of competitors in each of our markets 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  personnel and other resources than we do 
new competitors also could enter our markets 
we consider product quality  performance  customer service  on time delivery  price  distribution capabilities and breadth of product offerings to be the primary competitive factors in our markets 
our competitors may be able to offer more attractive pricing  duplicate our strategies  or develop enhancements to products that could offer performance features that are superior to our products 
competitive pressures  including those described above  and other factors could adversely affect our competitive position  involving a loss of market share or decreases in prices  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  some of our competitors are based in foreign countries 
table of contents and have cost structures and prices based on foreign currencies 
accordingly  currency fluctuations could cause our us dollar priced products to be less competitive than our competitors products that are priced in other currencies 
if we experience delays in introducing new products or if our existing or new products do not achieve or maintain market acceptance  our revenues may decrease 
our industries are characterized by intense competition  changes in end user requirements  technically complex products  and evolving product offerings and introductions 
we believe our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate or adapt to these factors and to offer  on a timely basis  products that meet customer demands 
failure to develop new and innovative products or to custom design existing products could result in the loss of existing customers to competitors or the inability to attract new business  either of which may adversely affect our revenues 
the development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring the anticipation of technological and market trends 
we may experience design  manufacturing  marketing or other difficulties  such as an inability to attract a sufficient number of qualified engineers  which could delay or prevent our development  introduction or marketing of new products or enhancements and result in unexpected expenses 
implementation of our acquisition strategy may not be successful  which could affect our ability to increase our revenues or could reduce our profitability 
one of our continued strategies is to increase our revenues and expand our markets through acquisitions that will provide us with complementary energy  aerospace  and flow technology products 
we expect to spend significant time and effort expanding our existing businesses and identifying  completing and integrating acquisitions 
we expect to face competition for acquisition candidates that may limit the number of acquisition opportunities available to us and may result in higher acquisition prices 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify  acquire or profitably manage additional companies or successfully integrate such additional companies without substantial costs  delays or other problems 
also  there can be no assurance that companies we acquire will achieve revenues  profitability or cash flows that justify our investment in them and may result in an impairment charge 
in addition  acquisitions may involve a number of special risks  including adverse short term effects on our reported operating results  diversion of management s attention  loss of key personnel at acquired companies  or unanticipated management or operational problems or legal liabilities 
some or all of these special risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we fail to manufacture and deliver high quality products  we may lose customers 
product quality and performance are a priority for our customers since many of our product applications involve caustic or volatile chemicals and  in many cases  involve processes that require precise control of fluids 
our products are used in the aerospace  military  commercial aircraft  pharmaceutical  medical  analytical equipment  oil and gas exploration  transmission and refining  chemical processing  and maritime industries 
these industries require products that meet stringent performance and safety standards 
if we fail to maintain and enforce quality control and testing procedures  our products will not meet these stringent performance and safety standards 
substandard products would seriously harm 
table of contents our reputation  resulting in both a loss of current customers to our competitors and damage to our ability to attract new customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we are unable to continue operating successfully overseas or to successfully expand into new international markets  our revenues may decrease 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from sales outside the united states 
in addition  one of our key growth strategies is to market our products in international markets not currently served by us in portions of europe  latin america and asia 
we may not succeed in marketing  selling and distributing our products in these new markets 
moreover  conducting business outside the united states is subject to additional risks  including currency exchange rate fluctuations  changes in regional  political or economic conditions  trade protection measures such as tariffs or import or export restrictions  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
one or more of these factors could prevent us from successfully expanding into new international markets and could also have a material adverse effect on our current international operations 
if we cannot pass on higher raw material or manufacturing costs to our customers  we may become less profitable 
one of the ways we attempt to manage the risk of higher raw material and manufacturing costs is to increase selling prices to our customers 
the markets we serve are extremely competitive and customers may not accept price increases or may look to alternative suppliers which may negatively impact our profitability and revenues 
if our suppliers cannot provide us with adequate quantities of materials to meet our customers demands on a timely basis or if the quality of the materials provided does not meet our standards we may lose customers or experience lower profitability 
some of our customer contracts require us to compensate those customers if we do not meet specified delivery obligations 
we rely on numerous suppliers to provide us with our required materials and in many instances these materials must meet certain specifications 
in recent years  we have enhanced our dependence on lower cost foreign sources of raw materials  components  and  in some cases  completed products 
managing a geographically diverse supply base inherently poses significant logistical challenges 
while we believe that we also have improved our ability to effectively manage a global supply base  a risk nevertheless exists that we could experience diminished supplier performance resulting in longer than expected lead times and or product quality issues 
the incurrence of such factors could have a negative impact on our ability to deliver our products to our customers within our committed time frames and could result in continued reductions of our operating and net income in future periods 
a change in international governmental policies or restrictions could result in decreased availability and increased costs for certain components and finished products that we outsource  which could adversely affect our profitability 
like most manufacturers of fluid control products  we attempt  where appropriate  to reduce costs by seeking lower cost sources of certain components and finished products 
many such sources are located 
table of contents in developing countries such as the people s republic of china  india and taiwan  where a change in governmental approach toward us trade could restrict the availability to us of such sources 
in addition  periods of war or other international tension could interfere with international freight operations and hinder our ability to take delivery of such components and products 
a decrease in the availability of these items could hinder our ability to timely meet our customers orders 
we attempt  when possible  to mitigate this risk by maintaining alternate sources for these components and products and by maintaining the capability to produce such items in our own manufacturing facilities 
however  even when we are able to mitigate this risk  the cost of obtaining such items from alternate sources or producing them ourselves is often considerably greater  and a shift toward such higher cost production could therefore adversely affect our profitability 
the costs of complying with existing or future environmental regulations and curing any violations of these regulations could increase our expenses or reduce our profitability 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  use and disposal of chemicals  solid and hazardous waste and other toxic and hazardous materials used to manufacture  or resulting from the process of manufacturing  our products 
we cannot predict the nature  scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing or future laws will be administered or interpreted 
future regulations could be applied to materials  products or activities that have not been subject to regulation previously 
the costs of complying with new or more stringent regulations  or with more vigorous enforcement of these or existing regulations could be significant 
environmental laws require us to maintain and comply with a number of permits  authorizations and approvals and to maintain and update training programs and safety data regarding materials used in our processes 
violations of these requirements could result in financial penalties and other enforcement actions 
we also could be required to halt one or more portions of our operations until a violation is cured 
although we attempt to operate in compliance with these environmental laws  we may not succeed in this effort at all times 
the costs of curing violations or resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by government authorities could be substantial 
the costs of complying with existing or future governmental regulations on importing and exporting practices and of curing any violations of these regulations  could increase our expenses  reduce our revenues or reduce our profitability 
we are subject to a variety of laws and international trade practices including regulations issued by the united states bureau of customs and border protection  the bureau of export administration  the department of state and the department of treasury 
we cannot predict the nature  scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international trading practices might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 
future regulations could limit the countries into which certain of our products may be sold or could restrict our access to  and increase the cost of obtaining products from  foreign sources 
in addition  actual or alleged violations of such regulations could result in enforcement actions and or financial penalties that could result in substantial costs 

table of contents if our internal controls over financial reporting do not comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  our business and stock price could be adversely affected 
if either management or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies one or more material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that exist as of the end of our fiscal year  the material weakness es will be reported either by management in its self assessment or by our independent registered public accounting firm in its report or both  which may result in a loss of public confidence and could have an adverse affect on our business and our stock price 
this could also result in significant additional expenditures responding to the section internal control audit and a diversion of management attention 
we face risks from product liability lawsuits that may adversely affect our business 
we  like other manufacturers and distributors of products designed to control and regulate fluids and chemicals  face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury  property damage or business interruption to our customers 
we may be subjected to various product liability claims  including  among others  that our products include inadequate or improper instructions for use or installation  or inadequate warnings concerning the effects of the failure of our products 
although we maintain strict quality controls and procedures  including the testing of raw materials and safety testing of selected finished products  we cannot be certain that our products will be completely free from defect 
in addition  in certain cases  we rely on third party manufacturers for our products or components of our products 
although we have liability insurance coverage  we cannot be certain that this insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost or  if available  will be adequate to cover any such liabilities 
we generally seek to obtain contractual indemnification from our third party suppliers  and for us to be added as an additional insured party under such parties insurance policies 
any such indemnification or insurance is limited by its terms and  as a practical matter  is limited to the credit worthiness of the indemnifying or insuring party 
in the event that we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification  product liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we depend on our key personnel and the loss of their services may adversely affect our business 
we believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of our senior management team and other key personnel 
if one or more members of our senior management team or other key personnel were unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions  our business could be seriously harmed 
in addition  if any of our key personnel joins a competitor or forms a competing company  some of our customers might choose to use the services of that competitor or those of a new company instead of our own 
other companies seeking to develop capabilities and products similar to ours may hire away some of our key personnel 
if we are unable to maintain our key personnel and attract new employees  the execution of our business strategy may be hindered and our growth limited 
various restrictions and agreements could hinder a takeover of us which is not supported by our board of directors or which is leveraged 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by laws  the delaware general corporation law and our shareholder rights plan contain provisions that could delay or prevent 
table of contents a change in control in a transaction that is not approved by our board of directors or that is on a leveraged basis or otherwise 
these include provisions creating a staggered board  limiting the shareholders powers to remove directors  and prohibiting shareholders from calling a special meeting or taking action by written consent in lieu of a shareholders meeting 
in addition  our board of directors has the authority  without further action by the shareholders  to set the terms of and to issue preferred stock 
issuing preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the owners of our common stock  including the loss of voting control to others 
additionally  we have adopted a shareholder rights plan providing for the issuance of rights that will cause substantial dilution to a person or group of persons that acquires or with respect to passive investors or more of our shares of common stock  unless the rights are redeemed 
delaying or preventing a takeover could result in our shareholders ultimately receiving less for their shares by deterring potential bidders for our stock or assets 
our debt agreements limit our ability to issue equity  make acquisitions  incur debt  pay dividends  make investments  sell assets  merge or raise capital 
our revolving credit facility agreement  dated july   governs our indebtedness 
this agreement includes provisions which place limitations on certain activities including our ability to issue shares of our common stock  incur additional indebtedness  create any liens or encumbrances on our assets or make any guarantees  make certain investments  pay cash dividends above certain limits  or dispose of or sell assets or enter into a merger or a similar transaction 
the trading price of our common stock continues to be volatile and investors in our common stock may experience substantial losses 
the trading price of our common stock may be  and has been  volatile in the past 
our common stock could decline or fluctuate in response to a variety of factors  including  but not limited to our failure to meet the performance estimates of securities analysts  changes in financial estimates of our revenues and operating results or buy sell recommendations by securities analysts  the timing of announcements by us or our competitors concerning significant product line developments  contracts or acquisitions or publicity regarding actual or potential results or performance  fluctuation in our quarterly operating results caused by fluctuations in revenue and expenses  substantial sales of our common stock by our existing shareholders  general stock market conditions  or other economic or external factors 
while we attempt in our public disclosures to provide forward looking information in order to enable investors to anticipate our future performance  such information by its nature represents our good faith forecasting efforts 
the unprecedented nature of the recent credit crisis and economic recession  together with the uncertain depth and duration of these crises  has rendered such forecasting more difficult 
as a result  our actual results could differ materially from our forecasts which could cause further volatility in the value of our common stock 
in addition  in and the stock market as a whole experienced dramatic price deterioration and volume fluctuations 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources 

table of contents our international activities expose us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
our international manufacturing and sales activities expose us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
such fluctuations could result in our i paying higher prices for certain imported goods and services  ii realizing lower prices for any sales denominated in currencies other than us dollars  iii realizing lower net income  on a us dollar basis  from our international operations due to the effects of translation from weakened functional currencies  and iv realizing higher costs to settle transactions denominated in other currencies 
any of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
our major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in western europe  canada and asia 
we use forward contracts to manage the currency risk related to business transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
we primarily utilize forward exchange contracts with maturities of less than eighteen months 
to the extent these transactions are completed  the contracts do not subject us to significant risk from exchange rate fluctuations because they offset gains and losses on the related foreign currency denominated transactions

item legal proceedings 
asbestos and bankruptcy litigation introduction on july  the filing date  our subsidiary leslie controls  inc leslie filed a voluntary petition the bankruptcy filing under chapter of the us bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the district of delaware and  simultaneously  filed a pre negotiated plan of reorganization as amended  the reorganization plan or plan in an effort to permanently resolve leslie s asbestos liability 
on february   the us federal district court for the district of delaware the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court s earlier order confirming leslie s reorganization plan  thus clearing the way for leslie to emerge from bankruptcy 
the following discussion addresses both events occurring prior to the bankruptcy filing and events occurring thereafter 
events pre dating leslie s bankruptcy filing like many other manufacturers of fluid control products  leslie  which we acquired in  had been up to the date of the bankruptcy filing named as a defendant in product liability actions brought on behalf of individuals seeking compensation for their alleged asbestos exposure 
in some instances  we also have been named individually and or as alleged successor in interest in these cases 
at the filing date  leslie was a named defendant in approximately  active  unresolved asbestos related claims filed in california  texas  new york  massachusetts  west virginia  rhode island  illinois and other states 
approximately of these claims involve claimants allegedly suffering from or the estates of decedents who allegedly died from mesothelioma  a fatal malignancy associated with asbestos exposure 
leslie s asbestos related claims generally involved its fluid control products 
leslie management believes that any asbestos was incorporated entirely within the product in a way that would not allow for any ambient asbestos during normal operation or during normal inspection and repair procedures 
leslie and its insurers general strategy was to vigorously defend these claims 
nevertheless  while we strongly believe that exposure to leslie s products did not cause asbestos related illness to any plaintiff  juries and courts have reached a different conclusion in particular cases and could have done so in others 
leslie resolved a number of asbestos related claims in the few years prior to the bankruptcy filing for strategic reasons  including avoidance of defense costs and the possible risk of excessive verdicts 
the amounts expended on asbestos related claims in any year were generally impacted by the number of claims filed  the volume of pre trial proceedings  and the number of trials and settlements 
leslie s bankruptcy filing and subsequent developments on the filing date  leslie filed the reorganization plan in an effort to permanently resolve leslie s asbestos liability 
key terms of the pre negotiated reorganization plan include the creation of a trust 
table of contents pursuant to section g of the us bankruptcy code the trust to be funded by a contribution by leslie consisting of a a million promissory note and b an assignment of any and all rights of leslie i to proceeds under existing insurance policies that provide coverage for asbestos personal injury claims  and ii to million of proceeds from a settlement agreement between leslie and one of its insurers  continental casualty  a cna company continental entered into in april  and a million cash contribution by circor 
all current and future asbestos claims against leslie  as well as all current and future derivative claims against circor or its affiliates or against leslie s former parent company  watts water technologies  inc watts  or its affiliates arising from leslie s alleged asbestos liabilities  will be channeled to the trust for review and payment  thus providing both leslie and circor with permanent court protection from such claims 
under the reorganization plan  leslie will remain a subsidiary of circor 
the reorganization plan was negotiated with both a committee of key plaintiff attorneys representing leslie s current asbestos claimants  and also with an independent representative of leslie s future claimants 
the bankruptcy filing automatically stayed the prosecution or commencement of all asbestos related claims against leslie 
on july   the bankruptcy court entered a temporary restraining order that barred the prosecution or commencement of claims against circor or watts arising from leslie s alleged asbestos liabilities  and  on august   the court granted leslie s request for a preliminary injunction that barred the prosecution or commencement of such claims until final approval of the reorganization plan under which all such claims would be permanently channeled to the trust 
under the bankruptcy code  confirmation of the reorganization plan required the approval of at least of current asbestos claimants as well as court approval 
leslie  in fact  ultimately received unanimous approval of the plan from the asbestos claimants who voted and  on october   the bankruptcy court held hearings on confirmation of the reorganization plan the confirmation hearings 
at the confirmation hearings  certain of leslie s insurers sought to object to the reorganization plan s confirmation 
the bankruptcy court  however  based on objections raised by leslie  determined that the terms of the reorganization plan were neutral to the rights of such insurers and ruled that the insurers did not have standing to raise objections to confirmation 
because leslie previously had resolved all of the other objections to confirmation of the reorganization plan  the confirmation hearings proceeded in an uncontested manner  and  on october   the bankruptcy court entered an order confirming the reorganization plan the confirmation order 
following issuance of the confirmation order  leslie sought the required review and approval of the g trust aspects of the reorganization plan by the district court 
in connection with this review  those insurers who previously sought to object at the confirmation hearings filed oppositions to the affirmation by the district court of the plan  and  in addition  appealed certain rulings made by the bankruptcy court leading up to the issuance of the confirmation order 
leslie eventually resolved the concerns of the insurers  however  by agreeing to certain changes in the plan language relative to insurance provisions 
after leslie sought and received from the bankruptcy court a revised confirmation order incorporating the agreed upon changes the revised confirmation order  an affirmation hearing was held by the district court on february  following that hearing  on february   the district court entered an order approving the g trust aspects of the reorganization plan and affirming the revised confirmation order the district court order 

table of contents funding of trust and emergence from bankruptcy under the district court order  all current and future asbestos claims against leslie  as well as all current and future derivative claims against circor or its affiliates or against watts or its affiliates arising from leslie s alleged asbestos liabilities  will now be permanently channeled to the trust for review and payment  thus providing both leslie and circor with permanent court protection from such claims 
we currently anticipate that the trust will be established and funded  and that leslie s emergence from bankruptcy will become final  during march of accounting indemnity and defense cost liabilities and assets leslie recorded an estimated liability associated with reported asbestos claims when it believed that a loss was both probable and could be reasonably estimated 
during  we engaged hamilton  rabinovitz and associates  inc hr a  a firm specializing in estimating expected liabilities of mass tort claims  to help us determine an estimate of leslie s asbestos related liabilities 
because leslie s claims experience was both limited and variable  hr a concluded that any estimate of pending or future liabilities of leslie s asbestos claims would be highly uncertain from a statistical perspective 
leslie s management determined  however  that  by using its historical albeit limited and variable average cost by disease classification in resolving closed claims  and by applying this information to the mix of current open claims  it could make a reasonable estimate of the indemnity costs to be incurred in resolving such current open claims 
as a result  leslie recorded an initial liability of million during the fourth quarter of for the estimated indemnity cost associated with resolution of its then open claims 
based on leslie s discussions with hr a regarding the impact of additional claims data on hr a s conclusion regarding estimating future claim liabilities  leslie requested that hr a update its analysis annually to determine whether such additional data warranted any change to hr a s analyses and conclusions regarding future estimation 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of  hr a updated its analysis and reaffirmed its conclusion  at that time  that a forecast of the number and value of any future asbestos claims was unwarranted and highly uncertain from a statistical perspective 
however  when again updating its analysis at management s request during the fourth quarter of  hr a concluded that leslie now had claims experience sufficient to provide a reasonable estimate of the liability associated not only with leslie s open asbestos claims but also with respect to future claims 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of  leslie recorded an additional million to its asbestos liability accrual for the estimated indemnity costs associated with future claims anticipated to be filed during the next five years 
asbestos related defense costs continued to be expensed as incurred and were not included in any future claim reserves 

table of contents during the second quarter of  as a result of leslie s bankruptcy filing and reorganization plan  we accrued liabilities based on the terms of the reorganization plan 
as of december   we therefore recorded net leslie asbestos and bankruptcy liabilities for resolution of pending and future claims of million all classified as a current liability compared to million as of december  a summary of leslie s accrued liabilities  including contributions to the trust under the reorganization plan for existing and future asbestos claims as well as incurred but unpaid asbestos defense cost liabilities and the related insurance recoveries  is provided below 
as of december in thousands existing claim indemnity liability amounts payable to g trust incurred defense cost liability insurance recoveries receivable net leslie asbestos and bankruptcy liability experience and financial statement impact the following tables provide more specific information regarding leslie s claim activity through the filing date as well as for the two years ended december  and for the year ended december through filing date beginning open claims claims filed claims resolved and dismissed ending open claims ending open mesothelioma claims 
table of contents the following table provides information regarding the ongoing pre tax costs associated with leslie s asbestos litigation as well as additional charges incurred for the years ended december    and the million of bankruptcy related costs is comprised of million of contributions to the trust  insurance recoveries of million  bankruptcy related professional fees of million  partially offset by million of previously accrued asbestos indemnity liability as of december  for the year ended december in thousands indemnity costs accrued filed cases five year future indemnity cost accrued adverse verdict interest costs verdict appealed defense cost incurred insurance recoveries adjustment insurance recoveries accrued bankruptcy related costs net pre tax leslie asbestos and bankruptcy expense insurance as of the filing date  we believed that the aggregate amount of indemnity on a cash basis remaining on leslie s primary layer of insurance was approximately million 
from a financial statement perspective  however  after giving effect to our accrual for the estimated indemnity cost of resolving pending claims  leslie had recorded the maximum amount of available primary layer insurance as of september as a result  asbestos related indemnity costs from that point forward were no longer partially offset by a corresponding insurance recovery 
however  defense costs  which were recognized as incurred  continued to be and  but for the bankruptcy filing  would have continued to be partially offset by a contribution from leslie s remaining primary layer insurance carrier until such time as the aggregate amount of indemnity claims paid out on a cash basis by the remaining primary layer insurance carrier exceeded policy limits 
in addition to its primary layer of insurance  leslie does have some available excess insurance coverage 
however  some of this excess insurance lies above layers of excess insurance written by insolvent insurers which could affect when leslie may be able to recover this excess insurance 
moreover  unlike primary policies under which defense costs do not erode policy limits  the terms of excess policies typically provide that covered defense costs do erode policy limits 
because the probability and amount of any recovery from excess carriers was uncertain  however  leslie had not accrued an insurance receivable for such recovery as of the filing date 
as discussed previously  under the reorganization plan  all remaining insurance proceeds are contributed to the trust

company overview circor international  inc designs  manufactures and markets valves and other highly engineered products and sub systems used in the energy  aerospace and industrial markets 
within our major product groups  we develop  sell and service a portfolio of fluid control products  subsystems and technologies that enable us to fulfill our customers unique fluid control application needs 
we have organized our business segment reporting structure into three segments energy  aerospace  and flow technologies 
our energy segment primarily serves large international energy projects  short cycle north american energy markets  and the pipeline transmission equipment and services end markets 
our aerospace segment primarily serves the commercial and military aerospace markets 
our flow technologies segment serves our broadest variety of end markets  including power generation  industrial and commercial hvac steam  industrial and process markets and chemical and refining 
the flow technologies segment also provides products specifically designed for the us and international navy applications 
regarding our results  we had revenues of million  a increase over  which included increases in all three of our segments 
a few of our major achievements in included  working toward affirmation of leslie s bankruptcy plan  expanding our capabilities in high growth markets in india  brazil and china  investing in organic growth and enhancing our sales capability in 
table of contents high growth markets 
we also made two strategic acquisitions during  one in india which was incorporated into our flow technologies segment and one us based landing gear business incorporated into our aerospace segment 
as we look toward  we plan to build on our accomplishments and continue our shift toward higher growth and higher profit end markets 
this includes enhancing our penetration of emerging geographic markets  such as india  china  the middle east and brazil 
we also plan to increase organic growth by expanding new product development  innovation and customer relationships  which aligns with our strategy of offering more bundled technologies and integrated subsystems 
we will drive margin expansion with lean manufacturing  low cost sourcing and our continuous improvement culture 
we feel our strong balance sheet and available credit facilities will provide us with the financial capital to execute our growth strategy  both organically and through acquisitions 
basis of presentation all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
certain prior period financial statement amounts have been reclassified to conform to currently reported presentations 
we monitor our business in three segments energy  aerospace and flow technologies 
we operate and report financial information using a week fiscal year ending december the data periods contained within our quarterly reports on form q reflect the results of operations for the week  week and week periods which generally end on the sunday nearest the calendar quarter end date 
critical accounting policies the following discussion of accounting policies is intended to supplement the section summary of significant accounting policies presented in note to our consolidated financial statements 
these policies were selected because they are broadly applicable within our operating units 
the expenses and accrued liabilities or allowances related to certain of these policies are initially based on our best estimates at the time of original entry in our accounting records 
adjustments are recorded when our actual experience  or new information concerning our expected experience  differs from underlying initial estimates 
these adjustments could be material if our actual or expected experience were to change significantly in a short period of time 
we make frequent comparisons of actual experience and expected experience in order to mitigate the likelihood of material adjustments 
there have been no significant changes from the methodology applied by management for critical accounting estimates previously disclosed in our annual report on form k 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when products are delivered  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  no significant post delivery obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
shipping and handling costs invoiced to customers are recorded as components of revenues and the associated costs are recorded as cost of revenues 

table of contents allowance for inventory we typically analyze our inventory aging and projected future usage on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of our inventory allowances 
we provide inventory allowances for excess  slow moving  and obsolete inventories determined primarily by estimates of future demand 
the allowance is measured on an item by item basis determined based on the difference between the cost of the inventory and estimated market value 
the provision for inventory allowance is a component of our cost of revenues 
assumptions about future demand are among the primary factors utilized to estimate market value 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
our net inventory balance was million as of december   compared to million as of december  our inventory allowance as of december  was million  compared to million as of december  our provision for inventory obsolescence was million  million  and million  for   and  respectively 
for the twelve months ended december   we have experienced increases in organic revenue  orders  and backlog 
we believe our inventory allowances remain adequate with the net realizable value of our inventory being higher than our current inventory cost 
if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence for any reason  including a change in technology or customer requirements  we could be required to increase our inventory allowances and our gross profit could be adversely affected 
inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain adequate inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence 
penalty accruals some of our customer agreements  primarily in our project related businesses  contain late shipment penalty clauses whereby we are contractually obligated to pay consideration to our customers if we do not meet specified shipment dates 
the accrual for estimated penalties is shown as a reduction of revenue and is based on several factors including limited historical customer settlement experience and management s assessment of specific shipment delay information 
accruals related to these potential late shipment penalties as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
this amount decreased during the twelve months ended december  due in part to a contract resolution with a significant customer 
as we conclude performance under these agreements  the actual amount of consideration paid to our customers may vary significantly from the amounts we currently have accrued 
concentrations of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and trade receivables 
a significant portion of our revenue and receivables are from customers who are either in or service the energy  aerospace  and industrial markets 

table of contents we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses 
during and  the company did not experience any significant losses related to the collection of our accounts receivable 
for the years ended december  and december   we had no customers from which we derived revenues that exceeded of our consolidated revenues 
acquisition accounting in connection with our acquisitions  we assess and formulate a plan related to the future integration of the acquired entity 
this process begins during the due diligence phase and is concluded within twelve months of the acquisition 
our methodology for determining the fair values relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques for industrial manufacturing companies and we utilize third party valuation firms to assist in the valuation of certain tangible and intangible assets 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in various legal claims and legal proceedings  some of which may involve substantial dollar amounts 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial position 
for more information related to our outstanding legal proceedings  see contingencies  commitments and guarantees in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements as well as legal proceedings in part i  item hereof 
impairment analysis as required by asc topic  goodwill and intangible assets  we perform an annual assessment as to whether there was an indication that goodwill and certain intangible assets are impaired 
we also perform impairment analyses whenever events and circumstances indicate that goodwill or certain intangibles may be impaired 
in accordance with the asc topic  we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
we utilize our three operating segments as our goodwill reporting units as we have discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management and businesses within each segment have similar economic characteristics 
for the year ended december   the company s three reporting units were energy  aerospace  and flow technologies with respective goodwill balances of million  million  and million 
for the year ended december   the company s three reporting units were energy  aerospace  and flow technologies with respective goodwill balances of million  million  and million 
we assess the fair value of our reporting units by utilizing the income approach  the guideline company method  and the market transaction method 
we utilize the income approach  based on a discounted 
table of contents cash flow valuation model as the basis for our conclusions  as we feel this provides the most reliable valuation indicator based on our long term projections for each reporting unit 
the guideline company and market transaction methods are utilized to corroborate the income approach 
the key assumptions utilized in our income approach include discount rates based on a weighted cost of capital and perpetual growth rates applied to cash flow projections 
also inherent in the discounted cash flow valuation are near term revenue growth rates over the next five years and estimated terminal value 
these assumptions contemplate business  market and overall economic conditions 
the value of indefinite lived trade names is also assessed using a discounted cash flow valuation model 
the key assumptions used include discount rates  royalty rates  and perpetual growth rates applied to projected sales 
these valuation procedures are consistent with goodwill impairment tests performed in prior years 
for the year ended december   we had no goodwill or intangible impairments 
for the year ended december   we had no goodwill impairments and we recognized intangible impairments of million consisting of two trade names within our energy and aerospace reporting units  where estimated future cash flows associated with these trade names could not support their carrying value on our balance sheet 
in late  certain negative macroeconomic factors began to impact the global credit markets and we noted significant adverse trends in business conditions in the fourth quarter of at that time  we identified significant deterioration in the expected future financial performance in most of our businesses within each of our reporting units compared to the expected future financial performance of these reporting units at the end of we also determined that the appropriate discount rate based on weighted average cost of capital as of december  was significantly higher than the discount rate used in our impairment assessment 
these factors contributed to the goodwill impairment charges we recorded in in  the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the respective book value  and no goodwill impairments were recorded 
the fair values utilized for our goodwill assessment exceeded the book value by approximately   and for our energy  aerospace and flow technologies reporting units  respectively 
the aggregate fair values utilized for our intangible assets exceeded the book value by approximately   and for our energy  aerospace and flow technologies reporting units  respectively 
see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on our goodwill and annual impairment analysis 
as a result of the evolving factors associated with leslie s asbestos matters  our outlook of diminished future cash flow for leslie  which is reported in our flow technologies reporting unit  was an indicator of impairment that triggered an impairment analysis on the long lived assets of leslie in accordance with asc topic in the fourth quarter at that time  the fair value of leslie s long lived assets exceeded the book value by over 
as part of our year end closing process  with the assistance of an independent third party appraisal firm  an updated impairment analysis was performed again for leslie 
as part of our year end closing process  we assessed that the fair value of leslie s long lived assets were at least equal to net book value  and no impairment charge was necessary 
as a result of leslie s anticipated emergence from bankruptcy and full resolution of leslie s asbestos matters  leslie s cash flows were no longer deemed to be impaired at december  
table of contents if our estimates or related projections change in the future due to changes in industry and market conditions  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
the goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  was million compared with million as of december  the amounts of our non amortizing intangible assets were million and million  as of december  and  respectively 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance 
our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate due to the impact of research and experimental tax credits  domestic manufacturing deduction  state taxes  and the tax impact of non us operations 
our effective tax rate was  and  for the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
the tax rate for included the tax impact of the million of leslie bankruptcy related costs 
excluding this charge and related tax benefit  the effective tax rate would have been 
for  we expect an effective income tax rate of approximately 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and vice versa 
changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof may also adversely affect our future effective tax rate 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
in  deferred income tax assets increased primarily due to the leslie bankruptcy asbestos settlement charge 
we maintained a total valuation allowance of million at december   for deferred income tax assets due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize these assets 
such deferred income tax assets primarily consisted of certain foreign tax credits  state net operating losses and state tax credits carried forward 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
if market conditions improve and future results of operations exceed our current expectations  our existing tax valuation allowances may be adjusted  resulting in future tax benefits 
alternatively  if market conditions deteriorate further or future results of operations are less than expected  future assessments may result in a determination that some or all of the deferred tax assets are not realizable 
as a result  we may need to establish additional tax valuation allowances for all or a portion of the gross deferred tax assets  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse 
valuation allowances are provided if based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
it is the company s policy to record estimated interest and penalties as income tax expense and tax credits as a reduction in income tax expense 
the company recognizes both interest and penalties as part 
table of contents of the income tax provision 
as of december  and december   accrued interest and penalties were million and million  respectively 
as of december   the liability for uncertain income tax positions was million excluding interest of million 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 
pension benefits we maintain two pension benefit plans  a qualified noncontributory defined benefit plan and a nonqualified  noncontributory defined benefit supplemental plan that provides benefits to certain highly compensated officers and employees 
to date  the supplemental plan remains an unfunded plan 
these plans include significant pension benefit obligations which are calculated based on actuarial valuations 
key assumptions are made in determining these obligations and related expenses  including expected rates of return on plan assets and discount rates 
benefits are based primarily on years of service and employees compensation 
as of july   in connection with a revision to our retirement plan  we froze the pension benefits of our qualified noncontributory plan participants 
under the revised plan  such participants generally do not accrue any additional benefits under the defined benefit plan after july  and instead receive enhanced benefits associated with our defined contribution k plan in which substantially all of our us employees are eligible to participate 
based on a desire to ensure compliance with section a of the internal revenue code  during we facilitated a mandatory cash out to all active and terminated employees of the supplemental plan who were not currently receiving benefit payments 
this pension settlement resulted in million of pre tax expense during the year ended december  as required in the recognition and disclosure provisions of asc topic  the company recognizes the over funded or under funded status of defined benefit post retirement plans in its balance sheet  measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation for other post retirement plans 
the change in the funded status of the plan is recognized in the year in which the change occurs through other comprehensive income 
these provisions also require plan assets and obligations to be measured as of the company s balance sheet date 
see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on our benefit plans 
assets of our qualified pension plan are comprised of equity investments of companies in the united states with large and small market capitalizations  fixed income securities issued by the united states government  or its agencies  and certain international equities 
there are no shares of our common stock in the plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to estimate pension expenses was for and for the qualified plan  the discount rate used to estimate the net pension expense for was and for was 
for the nonqualified plan  the discount rate used to estimate the net pension expenses for was and for was 
the effect of the discount rate changes from to raised our projected benefit obligation by approximately million and had a negligible impact on our expense 

table of contents unrecognized actuarial gains and losses in excess of the corridor defined as the threshold above which gains or losses need to be amortized are being recognized over approximately a twenty eight year period for the qualified plan  and a twenty three year period for the nonqualified plan  which represents the weighted average expected remaining life of the employee group 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on assets 
the fair value of our defined benefit plans assets at december  was less than the estimated projected benefit obligations 
the fair value of plan assets increased million to million as of december  compared to million as of december  the company s net pension liability decreased million to million as of december  compared to million as of december  see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on our benefit plans 
during  we made million in cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plan and million of cash payments for our non qualified supplemental plan 
in  we expect to make voluntary cash contributions of approximately million to our qualified plan and million in payments for our non qualified plan  although global capital market and interest rate fluctuations will impact future funding requirements 
we will continue to evaluate our expected long term rates of return on plan assets and discount rates at least annually and make adjustments as necessary  such adjustments could change the pension and post retirement obligations and expenses in the future 
if the actual operation of the plans differ from the assumptions  additional contributions by us may be required 
if we are required to make significant contributions to fund the defined benefit plans  reported results could be adversely affected and our cash flow available for other uses may be reduced 

table of contents year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the following tables set forth the results of operations  percentage of net revenue and the period to period percentage change in certain financial data for the year ended december  and december  year ended december  december  change dollars in thousands net revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses leslie asbestos and bankruptcy charges  net impairment charges special charges recoveries operating income other income expense interest expense  net other income  net total other expense income before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income net revenue net revenues for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to million  from million for the year ended december  the increase in net revenues for the year ended december  was attributable to the following year ended segment december  december  total change acquisitions operations foreign exchange in thousands energy aerospace flow technologies total our energy segment accounted for of net revenues for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the aerospace segment accounted for of net revenues for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the flow technologies segment accounted for of net revenues for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  
table of contents energy segment revenues increased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the increase was the result of additional revenues of million due to the fourth quarter acquisition of pipeline engineering partially offset by organic declines of million and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations of million 
the organic declines were the result of weakness in our project businesses including large international and us pipeline projects partially offset by a year over year rebound in short cycle north american business 
orders for this segment increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to strength in short cycle north american business  which has rebounded from the low order intake recorded during  as did  to a lesser extent  us pipeline equipment orders 
in addition  orders increased year over year as a result of the fourth quarter acquisition of pipeline engineering  partially offset by lower large international projects 
backlog for our energy segment has increased by million to million as of december  compared to million for the same period in throughout we saw a rebound in north american short cycle activities  which helped to offset lower large international projects compared to the prior year 
during the fourth quarter ended december   we saw our first significant improvement in order activity for large international and north american pipeline projects 
aerospace segment revenues increased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the increase was driven primarily by the august acquisition of castle and the march acquisitions of bodet and atlas productions atlas increasing revenues by million partially offset by organic declines of million driven primarily by weakness in business jet and military and defense orders and unfavorable currency fluctuations of million 
orders for this segment increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this order increase was primarily due to the positive impact of acquisitions  increases in military  commercial oem and aftermarket orders partially offset by the timing of military landing gear orders  which we had recorded in order backlog increased to million as of december  compared to million as of december  driven primarily by our acquisition of castle  which added approximately million to our backlog during the year ended december  we believe there have been signs that the commercial aerospace markets will see modest year over year improvement during  however  military markets continue to have some uncertainty for due to limited budgets and the winding down of military activities in iraq 
flow technologies segment revenues increased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the revenue increase was due to organic growth of million  primarily due to semiconductor strength  which has rebounded from distressed levels in  a moderate rebound in process and industrial markets supporting growth in china along with million from the mazda ltd 
mazda acquisition in the second quarter of these increases were partially offset by weakness in the chemical  refining and hvac markets and million from foreign currency fluctuations 
this segment s customer orders increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period last year with improvement in most markets except commercial construction  chemical and refining 
order backlog grew to million as of december  compared to million as of december   driven broadly across most of our businesses with the exception of sampling 
as we enter  we believe most of our markets will be 
table of contents stable except for continued weakness in chemical  refining and hvac 
in addition  we believe the semiconductor market  which has been strong  will soften in gross profit consolidated gross profit increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in consolidated gross margin of for was a decrease of basis points from gross profit for our energy segment decreased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the gross profit decrease was due primarily to the organic revenue declines principally in large international and us pipeline projects 
in addition  gross profit declined million due to lower foreign exchange rates compared to the us dollar 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase resulting from the october acquisition of pipeline engineering 
gross margins declined basis points to for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in the decline was driven primarily by pricing pressures  especially in large international projects  unfavorable product mix and costs on certain large projects 
this decline was partially offset by productivity gains from lower headcount and favorable penalty reserve adjustments associated with closed projects as well as reduced fixed expenses associated with the closing of two facilities during gross profit for our aerospace segment increased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this gross profit increase was due primarily to organic growth of million as well as million associated with the august acquisition of castle and the march acquisitions of bodet and atlas 
this increase was offset in part by foreign currency impacts of million 
the largest components of the basis point improvement in gross margins in compared to were productivity gains  favorable pricing and product mix partially offset by lower volume and associated operating leverage 
gross profit for the flow technologies segment increased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in organic growth resulted in a million increase in gross profit and the mazda acquisition in may added another million 
these increases were partially offset by unfavorable currency fluctuations of million 
gross margins expanded basis points driven primarily by increased volume and the associated leverage and pricing  partially offset by an unfavorable product mix and new program expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for selling  general and administrative expenses were of revenues for  an increase of basis points from selling  general and administrative expenses for our energy segment increased or million for the year ended december  compared to the same period for the pipeline engineering acquisition in the fourth quarter of accounted for an million incremental increase  which is partially offset by organic declines of million that is inclusive of incremental investment in growth 
table of contents initiatives along with lower expenses associated with reduced headcount and the consolidation of two facilities in the prior year 
in addition  foreign currency fluctuations reduced expenses million 
selling  general and administrative expenses for our aerospace segment increased or million for the year ended december  compared to the same period for the majority of this increase can be attributed to organic increases including expenses related to engineering and product development supporting new programs and an incremental million resulting from the recent acquisitions of castle  bodet and atlas 
these increases were partially offset by million due to foreign exchange rates compared to the us dollar 
selling  general and administrative expenses for our flow technologies segment increased by million or for the year ended december  compared to the same period for this increase was principally due to a million increase attributable to the mazda acquisition and a million operational increase related primarily to inflation and growth programs partially offset by lower severance costs and a gain recognized from the sale of a small distribution operation 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations 
corporate  general and administrative expenses increased million to million in compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher incentive costs and share based compensation partially offset by decreased pension related expenses and professional fees 
leslie asbestos and bankruptcy related charges  net asbestos and bankruptcy related charges are primarily associated with our leslie subsidiary in the flow technologies segment 
net asbestos and bankruptcy related charges decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the majority of this decrease is attributed to a one time non cash charge of million taken during the fourth quarter of as an estimate of the indemnity costs associated with claims to be filed during the next five years 
partially offsetting this reduction due to the charge are leslie bankruptcy related charges of million incurred during and lower year over year indemnity accruals  defense costs and insurance recovery adjustments 
for more information on asbestos related litigation  see contingencies  commitments and guarantees in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements as well as legal proceedings in part i  item special impairment charges during the year ended december   we did not record any special charges or impairment charges 
this compares to the special recoveries recorded during of million  which included million we received in relating to a asset sale within our energy segment and a million gain associated with an aerospace acquisition for fair value of the acquired assets exceeding the consideration transferred 
during  in connection with our annual assessment  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to two intangible asset trade names of minor product lines within our aerospace and energy segments

this was partially offset by favorable penalty reserve adjustments associated with closed projects and productivity gains from the lower headcount and reduced fixed expenses associated with the closing of two facilities in operating income for the aerospace segment decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the decrease in operating income was due primarily to the organic growth decline  the castle acquisition transaction expenses and engineering and product development supporting new customer programs 
this was partially offset by productivity gains  favorable pricing and product mix 
operating income for the flow technologies segment increased million  or  to a net loss of million for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the same period in the operating loss in includes million of leslie asbestos and bankruptcy related charges whereas the operating loss in includes million of leslie asbestos and bankruptcy related charges 
the remaining increase was primarily the result of organic growth and associated leverage  pricing and lower severance costs as well as a gain from the sale of a small distribution operation 
these increases were partially offset by unfavorable product mix and investments in growth programs 
interest expense  net interest expense  net  increased million to million for compared to million in the increase in interest expense  net  was primarily due to increased borrowing costs on our revolving credit facility incurred primarily to fund acquisitions 

table of contents other income  net other income  net  was less than million for the year ended december  compared to million income in the same period of the difference of million was largely the result of foreign currency fluctuations

excluding the impact of the leslie asbestos and bankruptcy charges  the effective tax rate for and would have been and  respectively 
excluding the leslie asbestos and bankruptcy charges  the tax rate decreased from the tax rate primarily due to higher income in lower tax jurisdictions 
net income net income increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in this increase is primarily the result of lower leslie asbestos and bankruptcy charges and higher profitability in the flow technologies segment offset by higher interest expense and lower profitability in the energy and aerospace segments

table of contents net revenue net revenues for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  to million  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in net revenues for the year ended december  was attributable to the following year ended segment december  december  total change acquisitions operations foreign exchange in thousands energy aerospace flow technologies total the energy segment accounted for of net revenues for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the aerospace segment accounted for of net revenues for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the flow technologies segment accounted for of net revenues for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  energy revenues decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the decrease was the result of organic declines of million and unfavorable million from foreign currency fluctuations primarily due to a lower euro compared to the us dollar partially offset by additional revenues of million due to the fourth quarter acquisition of pipeline engineering 
the organic declines were primarily due to an approximately decline in north american oil and gas drilling and production activities as well as lower revenues from large international and us pipeline equipment projects 
orders for this segment declined million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to the continued weakness in north american drilling and production activities resulting from lower oil and natural gas pricing and demand  partially offset by increased orders in large international projects with significant lead times and the addition of pipeline engineering for one quarter 
backlog has declined by million to million as of december  compared to million for the same period in aerospace revenues increased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the increase was driven primarily by the march acquisitions of bodet and atlas as well as the full year input of the may acquisition of motor tech partially offset by organic declines driven by softening markets for commercial aerospace  military and defense in addition to unfavorable currency fluctuations 
orders for this segment declined million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to the timing of military landing gear orders and the lower commercial aerospace orders driven by lower build rates for business jets and reduced commercial spares driven by airline capacity reductions 
order backlog grew to million as of december  compared to december  driven primarily by our recent acquisitions 

table of contents flow technologies revenues decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this segment s revenues were negatively impacted by organic declines of million and unfavorable foreign exchange rates compared to the us dollar of million 
the organic decline was broad based  affecting most areas  with the exception of growth in the semi conductor and maritime markets 
this segment s customer orders decreased for the year ended december  compared to the same period last year with weakness in most markets except semi conductor 
order backlog grew slightly to million as of december  compared to million as of december  driven primarily by a large us naval order booked during the fourth quarter of gross profit consolidated gross profit decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in consolidated gross margin of for was a decrease of basis points from gross profit for the energy segment decreased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the gross profit decrease was due primarily to the organic revenue declines in both the north american short cycle business and in large international projects 
in addition  gross profit declined million due to lower foreign exchange rates compared to the us dollar partially offset by a million increase resulting from the october acquisition of pipeline engineering 
the loss in operating leverage across many of our businesses  together with unfavorable pricing primarily in large international projects and north american pipeline business due to intensified competition and re quoting activity  were the major drivers in the basis point decline in gross margin to for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in gross profit for the aerospace segment increased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this gross profit increase was due primarily to the march acquisitions of bodet and atlas which contributed million  and was offset in part by a reduction from organic declines of million and a decline from foreign currency impacts of million 
the largest components of the basis point decline in gross margins in compared to were due to the lost volume and associated operating leverage  and the margin dilution due to our bodet acquisition which has margins lower than the segment average  partially offset by savings from material prices and productivity projects 
gross profit for the flow technologies segment decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in unfavorable currency fluctuations compared to the us dollar reduced gross profit by million whereas lower organic revenues reduced gross profit by million 
despite the reduction in gross profit  gross margins expanded basis points driven primarily by favorable product mix  savings associated with quality of earnings initiatives  material savings and favorable pricing 
these positives were partially offset by lower volume and associated operating leverage 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for selling  general and administrative 
table of contents expenses were of revenues for  an increase of basis points from selling  general and administrative expenses for the energy segment decreased or million 
the majority of this decrease was due to the organic declines resulting in lower sales commissions  reduced other selling and general administrative costs  and a reduction of million due to lower foreign exchange rates  primarily for the euro compared to the us dollar 
these declines were partially offset by million incremental costs associated with the pipeline engineering acquisition as well as expenses associated with severance as year over year we reduced the number of employees in this segment in excess of excluding acquisitions and expenses to expand global sales 
we also had facility relocation expenses during the year as we exited two leased facilities 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the aerospace segment increased or million 
the majority of this increase can be attributed to an incremental million resulting from the recent acquisitions of bodet  atlas  and motor tech partially offset by organic declines due to reduced selling and general administrative costs  and a reduction of million due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates compared to the us dollar 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the flow technologies segment decreased by million or over  which was due primarily to favorable currency fluctuations of million and lower commissions and selling costs 
these reductions were partially offset by expenses associated with severance as year over year we reduced the number of employees in this segment by approximately and expenses associated with facility closures 
corporate  general and administrative expenses decreased million to million in compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to lower short term incentive and share based compensation partially offset by increased pension expense and investments in supply chain and growth initiatives in india 
leslie asbestos charges  net asbestos charges were primarily associated with our leslie subsidiary in the flow technologies segment 
net asbestos related costs increased to million for the fiscal year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the majority of this increase is attributed to a charge of million taken during the fourth quarter of as an estimate of the indemnity costs associated with claims to be filed during the next five years 
the remainder of the increase is comprised of lower insurance recoveries primarily due to the exhaustion of certain insurance policies and due to higher gross defense expenses partially offset by the reversal of an adverse verdict accrued in of million 
for more information on asbestos related litigation  see contingencies  commitments and guarantees in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements as well as legal proceedings in part i  item special impairment charges during the twelve months ended december   we recorded special charges recoveries of million  which included a receipt of million we received in relating to a asset sale within our energy segment and a million gain associated with a recent acquisition for fair value of the acquired assets exceeding the consideration transferred 
during  in connection with our annual 
table of contents assessment  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to two intangible asset trade names of minor product lines within our aerospace and energy segments

operating income for the energy segment decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in operating margins declined basis points to on a revenue decrease of compared to the decrease in operating income was due primarily to organic revenue declines across the segment  the associated lost operating leverage  unfavorable pricing in large international projects and costs to reduce our workforce plus facility relocation expenses 
this was partially offset by lower commissions  reduced expenses and increased productivity 
operating income for the aerospace segment increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the same period in the increased operating income is primarily due to million fewer special charges associated with goodwill and intangible impairments during compared to excluding the impairment impact operating income was basically flat year on year as the benefit of acquisitions of million plus global material and productivity gains were offset primarily by lower volume and associated operating leverage 
operating loss for the flow technologies segment decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the same period in this operating improvement is due primarily to lower goodwill and intangible impairments of million offset by higher asbestos related costs related to the charge of million estimate of the future indemnity claims to be filed during the next five years 
the decline in operating income after the impact 
table of contents of goodwill and intangible impairment and asbestos related costs was primarily the result of lower volume and associated operating leverage  costs to reduce our workforce and exit facilities partially offset by favorable pricing and savings associated with quality of earnings initiatives 
interest income expense  net interest expense  net  increased million to million for compared to million income in the increase in interest expense  net  was primarily due to lower interest on our invested cash and increased borrowing costs on our new revolving credit facility

the tax rate excluding the non cash charge decreased from the tax rate excluding the impairment primarily due to higher income in lower tax jurisdictions 
net income loss net income increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the same period in the increase was a result of a million reduction in pre tax goodwill and intangible impairment charges during compared to this increase is partially offset by decreased profitability of both the energy and flow technologies segments 
the energy segment reduction was primarily due to the large revenue decline while the flow technologies segment reduction is mostly attributed to increased asbestos costs associated with the charge taken during the fourth quarter of related to future indemnity costs associated with claims anticipated to be filed over the next five years 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity needs arise primarily from capital investment in machinery  equipment and the improvement of facilities  funding working capital requirements to support business growth initiatives  acquisitions  dividend payments  pension funding obligations and debt service costs 
we continue to generate cash from operations and remain in a strong financial position  with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses  strategic acquisitions and managing our capital structure on a short and long term basis 

table of contents the following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the periods indicated in thousands cash flow provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash balances increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december   we generated million in cash flow from operating activities which was million less than the cash flow generated during the twelve months ended december   primarily due to increases in trade accounts receivable and inventories offset by higher accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the million used by investing activities included business acquisitions of million and million used for the net purchase of capital equipment  partially offset by a net million of proceeds from the sale of investments 
financing activities used million which included a net million decrease of debt  million in dividends paid to shareholders and million of net proceeds from the exercise of share based compensation and related income tax effects 
as of december   total debt was million compared to million at december  total debt as a percentage of total shareholders equity was less than as of december  compared to as of december  in july  we entered into a new three and one half year  unsecured credit agreement that provides for a million revolving line of credit and terminated the previously available million revolving credit facility that we entered into in december the new agreement includes a million accordion feature for a maximum facility size of million 
the new credit agreement also allows for additional indebtedness not to exceed million 
there has been no change in our financial covenants from our previous agreement that we entered into in december we anticipate using this new credit facility to fund potential acquisitions  to support our working capital needs  and for general corporate purposes 
as of december   we had no borrowings outstanding under our new credit facility and million was allocated to support outstanding letters of credit 
certain of our loan agreements contain covenants that require  among other items  maintenance of certain financial ratios and also limit our ability to enter into secured and unsecured borrowing arrangements  issue dividends to shareholders  acquire and dispose of businesses  transfer assets among domestic and international entities  participate in certain higher yielding long term investment vehicles  and issue additional shares of our stock 
the two primary financial covenants are leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants related to our existing debt obligations at december  and we believe it is reasonably likely that we will continue to meet such covenants in the near future as leslie proceeds with its pre negotiated plan of reorganization in us bankruptcy court and the related funding of the trust under section g of the us bankruptcy code  which we anticipate will occur during march 
table of contents the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december  compared to at december  cash and cash equivalents were million as of december  compared to million as of december  the decrease in the current ratio was primarily due to leslie s bankruptcy filing and reorganization plan as the related asbestos liability was all classified as a current liability 
on november   we filed with the sec a shelf registration statement on form s under which we may issue up to million of securities including debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  warrants to purchase any such securities and units comprised of any such securities the securities 
the registration statement was declared effective by the sec on december  we may offer these securities from time to time in amounts  at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of sale 
we believe that with this registration statement  we will have greater flexibility to take advantage of financing opportunities  acquisitions and other business opportunities when and if such opportunities arise 
depending on market conditions  we may issue securities under this or future registration statements or in private offerings exempt from registration requirements 
in  we expect to generate positive cash flow from operating activities sufficient to support our capital expenditures and pay dividends of approximately million based on our current dividend practice of paying per share annually 
based on our expected cash flows from operations and contractually available borrowings under our credit facilities  we expect to have sufficient liquidity to fund working capital needs and future growth 
we continue to search for strategic acquisitions  a larger acquisition may require additional borrowings and or the issuance of our common stock 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  that affect our liquidity payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years contractual cash obligations current portion of long term debt total short term borrowings long term debt  less current portion interest payments on debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations other commercial commitments us standby letters of credit international standby letters of credit commercial contract commitments total commercial commitments 
table of contents the interest on certain of our other debt balances  with scheduled repayment dates between and and interest rates ranging between and have been included in the interest payments on debt line within the contractual cash obligations schedule 
capital lease obligations of million and million are included in the current portion of long term debt and long term debt  less current portion line items  respectively 
the most significant of our commercial contract commitments relate to approximately million of commitments related to open purchase orders  million of which extend to the remaining million in commitments primarily relate to loan commitment fees and employment agreements 
as of december   we did not have any open purchase order commitments that extend beyond in  we contributed million to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in addition to million in payments to our non qualified supplemental plan 
in  we contributed million to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in addition to million in payments to our non qualified supplemental plan 
in  we expect to make plan contributions totaling million  consisting of million in contributions to our qualified plan and payments of million for our non qualified plan 
the estimates for plan funding for future periods may change as a result of the uncertainties concerning the return on plan assets  the number of plan participants  and other changes in actuarial assumptions 
we anticipate fulfilling these commitments through our generation of cash flow from operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements  other than operating leases  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources that is material to investors 
new accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles a replacement of fasb statement no 
sfas 
with the issuance of sfas  the fasb standards codification codification becomes the single source of authoritative us accounting and reporting standards applicable for all non governmental entities  with the exception of guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission 
the codification does not change current us gaap  but changes the referencing of financial standards and is intended to simplify user access to authoritative us gaap  by providing all the authoritative literature related to a particular topic in one place 
the codification is effective for interim and annual periods ended after september  as the codification was not intended to change or alter existing gaap  it will not have any impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued a new accounting pronouncement found under accounting standards codification asc topic regarding subsequent events formerly sfas which defines a date through which management must evaluate subsequent events  and lists the circumstances under 
table of contents which an entity must recognize and disclose events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date 
we adopted this standard as of june  and it had no material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the oil and gas markets historically have been subject to cyclicality depending upon supply and demand for crude oil  its derivatives and natural gas 
when oil or gas prices decrease expenditures on maintenance and repair decline rapidly and outlays for exploration and in field drilling projects decrease and  accordingly  demand for valve products is reduced 
however  when oil and gas prices rise  maintenance and repair activity and spending for facilities projects normally increase and we benefit from increased demand for valve products 
however  oil or gas price increases may be considered temporary in nature or not driven by customer demand and  therefore  may result in longer lead times for increases in petrochemical sales orders 
as a result  the timing and magnitude of changes in market demand for oil and gas valve products are difficult to predict 
similarly  although not to the same extent as the oil and gas markets  the general industrial  chemical processing  aerospace  military and maritime markets have historically experienced cyclical fluctuations in demand 
these fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
foreign currency exchange risk the company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations including foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk 
the company currently uses derivative instruments to manage foreign currency risk on certain business transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
to the extent the underlying transactions hedged are completed  these forward contracts do not subject us to significant risk from exchange rate movements because they offset gains and losses on the related foreign currency denominated transactions 
these forward contracts do not qualify as hedging instruments and  therefore  do not qualify for fair value or cash flow hedge treatment 
any unrealized gains and losses on our contracts are recognized as a component of other expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   we had eighteen forward contracts with contract values as shown below in thousands currency number contract amount us dollar gbp  us dollars euro us dollar euros us dollar euro  us dollars this compares to thirty four forward contracts as of december  the fair value liability of the derivative forward contracts as of december  was approximately million and is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our balance sheet 
this compares to a fair value asset of million that was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet as of december  
table of contents we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our foreign currency forward contracts fall within level of the fair value hierarchy  found under asc topic the credit valuation adjustments  such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by ourselves and our counterparties are level inputs 
however  we have assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our foreign currency forward contracts and determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation 
as a result  we have determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in level of the fair value hierarchy
