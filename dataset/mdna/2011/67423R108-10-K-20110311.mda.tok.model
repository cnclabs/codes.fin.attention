some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing requirements  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the risk factors section of this report for a discussion of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company that develops  markets and sells  and are a leading provider of  proprietary topical aesthetic and therapeutic prescription strength skin care systems in the physician dispensed market 
our products are designed to prevent and improve some of the most common and visible skin disorders in adult skin  including premature aging  photodamage  skin laxity  hyperpigmentation  acne  sun damage  facial redness and soft tissue deficits  such as fine lines and wrinkles 
current products 
our primary product line is the obagi nu derm system  which we believe is the leading clinically proven  prescription based  topical skin health system on the market that has been shown to enhance the skin s overall health by correcting photodamage at the cellular level  resulting in a reduction of the visible signs of aging 
the primary active ingredients in this system are hydroquinone and otc skin care agents 
in april  we introduced the obagi c rx system consisting of a combination of prescription and otc drugs and adjunctive cosmetic skin care products to treat skin conditions resulting from sun damage and the oxidative damage of free radicals 
the central ingredients in this system are hydr oquinone and vitamin c 
in october  we launched the obagi professional c products  a complete line of proprietary  non prescription products  which consists of vitamin c serums used to reduce the appearance of damage to the skin caused by ultraviolet radiation and other environmental influences 
in july  we launched our obagi condition enhance system  for use in conjunction with commonly performed surgical and non surgical cosmetic procedures 
in october  we launched our first product in the elastiderm product line  an eye cream for improving the elasticity and skin tone around the eyes 
we introduced the clenziderm md system and a second product in the elastiderm product line to address acne and skin elasticity around the eye  respectively  based on positive interim clinical results  in february in july  we launched our second system in the clenziderm md line  clenziderm md system ii  which is specifically formulate d for normal to dry skin 
in august  we launched two new nu derm condition enhance systems 
one is designed specifically for use with non surgical procedures while the other has been developed for use with surgical procedures 
in february  we launched elastiderm d colletage  a system to treat skin conditions resulting from sun damage and improve the elasticity and skin tone for the neck and chest area 
in january  we launched obagi rosaclear  a system to treat the symptoms of rosacea 
in september  we also began offering refissa by spear  a fda approved strength tretinoin with an emollient base that has a broad indication for treatment of fine facial lines  hyperpigmentation and tactile roughness 
in october  we launched elastilash eyelash solution  a peptide based eyelash solution that can help achieve the appearance of thicker  fuller looking eyelashes 
in january  we launched blue pe el radiance  a gentle salicylic acid based peel that utilizes a unique blend of acids and other soothing ingredients to exfoliate  even out skin tone and improve overall complexion  with little to no downtime 
we also market tretinoin  used for the topical treatment of acne in the us  metronidazole  used for the treatment of facial rosacea in the us  and the obagi blue peel essential kit  used to aid the physician in the application of skin peeling actives 
future products 
we focus our research and new product development activities on improving the efficacy of established prescription and otc therapeutic agents by enhancing the penetration of these agents across the skin barrier using our proprietary technologies collectively known as penetrating therapeutics 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to introduce any additional systems using these technologies 
us distribution 
we market all of our products through our direct sales force in the united states primarily to plastic surgeons  dermatologists and other physicians who are focused on aesthetic skin care 
aesthetic skin care 
as of december   we sold our products to approximately  physician dispensing accounts in the united states  with no single customer accounting for more than of our net sales 
our current products are not eligible for reimbursement from third party payors such as health insurance organizations 
we generated us net sales of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
international distribution 
we market our products internationally through international distribution and two licensing partners that have sales and marketing activities in countries outside of the united states 
our distributors use a model similar to our business model in the united states  selling our products through direct sales representatives to physicians  or through alternative distribution channels depending on regulatory requirements and industry practices 
we generated international net sales of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
licensing 
we market our products in the japanese retail markets through license agreements with rohto 
under our agreements  rohto is licensed to manufacture and sell a series of otc products developed by it under the obagi brand name  as well as obagi c products  in the japanese drug store channel  and we receive a royalty based upon sales of obagi branded products in japan by rohto 
rohto s obagi branded products are sold through approximately  high end drug stores 
we have other licensing arrangements in japan to market and sell otc product systems under the obagi brand  both for in office use in facial procedures  as well as for sale as a take home product kit in the spa channel 
we receive royalties based up on these arrangements 
we generated licensing revenue of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
exit of pharmacy channel 
in august  we entered the pharmacy channel for the first time by launching soluclenz rx gel  a solubilized bpo gel for the treatment of acne  which was available only by prescription 
however  after closely monitoring the progress of the launch and weekly sales data  we determined that the distribution of a single prescription product through the pharmacy channel and the ongoing investment to support that channel had become cost prohibitive 
accordingly  on april   we announced that we would no longer sell soluclenz in the pharmacy channel 
in connection with the exit of the pharmacy channel  during the year ended december   we recorded charges approximating million  related to contractual deposits  obsolete selling materials and other contract termination fees included within selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
in addition  during the year ended december   we reserved approximately million in inventory included within cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income 
during the quarter ended december   revenue for the remaining units dispensed during the period was fully recognized as we informed our soluclenz distributors that we were no longer going to issue credit for returned inventory 
sales 
our total net sales have grown from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  factors contributing to our sales generation include our professional marketing efforts to physi cians 
our professional sales force targets physicians who are focused on aesthetic and therapeutic skin care and educates them on how to best provide our products to their patients 
our professional sales force also provides education to physicians  aestheticians  other staff and patients about the benefits of promoting skin health 
we have increased our sales force from employees as of january  to employees as of december  we will continue to invest in expanding our sales force as warranted by the success of new product offerings and continued core product growth 
we currently do not have plans to hire a substantial number of employees in strong growth in the aesthetic skin care market 
we believe the market demand for cosmetic facial procedures reflects a growing desire and acceptance among the aging population to seek aesthetic facial products and procedures from their physicians 
with our leading position in the physician dispensed channel  the clinically proven aesthetic benefits of our products and the potential of our systems to enhance or complement many other facial procedures  we believe we are well positioned to meet this growing patient demand 
conducting clinical studies on our products 
we have completed clinical studies since to demon strate the efficacy of our products 
we believe that these clinical studies provide our products added scientific credibility in the physician dispensed market 
we currently plan to initiate approximately additional clinical studies in international 
we have formal distribution agreements with distribution and two licensing partners and a trademark and product know how license agreement in the otc market in japan 
currently  those distributors have sales activities in approximately countries  with the most successful distributors in coming primarily from the middle east  europe and southeast asia 
results of operations 
we commenced operations in  and as of december   we had accumulated earnings of million 
we reported net income of million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
seasonality 
sales of our products have historically been higher between september and march 
we believe this is due to increased product use and patient compliance during these months 
we believe this increased usage and compliance relates to several factors such as higher patient tendencies toward daily compliance inversely proportionate to their tendency to travel and or engage in other disruptive activities during summer months 
patient travel and other disruptive activities that affect compliance are at their peak during july and august 
the effects of seasonality in the past have been offset by the launch of new products 
this trend was very pronounced during when we launched four new product offerings and rebranded two systems 
however  we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to offset such seasonality in the future 
economy 
many treatments in which our products are used are considered cosmetic in nature  are typically paid for by the patient out of disposable income and are generally not subject to reimbursement by third party payors such as health insurance organizations 
as a result  we believe that our current and future sales growth may be influenced by the economic conditions within the geographic markets in which we sell our products 
although there are modest signs of economic recovery  it is unclear whether the economy will show sustained growth and or stability 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that the improvement in revenue growth that we experienced in the fourth quarter of and during the year ended december   will be sustainable 
even with continued growth in many of our markets during this period  the recent recession could adversely impact our business in the future causing a decline in demand for our products  particularly if uncertain economic conditions are prolonged or worsen 
we do believe that some of the negative impact experienced during the majority of was partially offset due to the following i we are the leader in the physician dispensed market  ii the aesthetic nature of our products  iii the lower price point of our products compared to other aesthetic products in our market  iv the desire to maintain a healthy and youthful appearance  and v the demographics of the patients who use our products 
future growth 
we believe that our future growth will be driven by increased direct sales coverage  penetration into non core markets such as other medical specialties  ongoing marketing efforts to create increased awareness of the obagi brand and the benefits of skin health and new product offerings 
we plan to continue to invest resources on the commercialization of new applications of our current products  the continuing development of our pipeline of products and the in licensing or acquisition of new product opportunities 
however  our current business plan does not anticipate that we invest significant resources in these strategic initiatives in as a result  we believe that our ongoing profitability is primarily dependent u pon the continued success of our current product offerings and certain other strategic marketing initiatives 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  sales and expenses  and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances  accounts receivable  inventory  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we use authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
 by their nature  these estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
as a result  it is possible that our actual results will differ significantly from these estimates 
our significant accounting policies are further described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues for our physician dispensed segment in accordance with asc  revenue recognition asc  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the sec 
asc outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies 
we recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii shipment of products has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the sales price charged is fixed or determinable  and iv collection is reasonably assured 
our shipment terms are fob shipping point as outlined in our sales agreements 
our domestic sales agreements do not provide for rights of return or price protection 
however  we may approve returns on a case by case basis at our discretion 
certain international distribution agreements do provide for rights of return and price protection 
generally  such return rights are for a period of not more than days after the products have been shipped to the distributors 
in accordance with asc  revenue recognition products asc  we continuously monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated amount of such returns  based on historical experienc e and any notification we receive of pending returns 
we do not grant any warranty provisions on our products 
we provide for discounts and allowances based on historical experience at the time revenue is recognized as a reduction to revenue 
to date  such provisions have approximated management s estimates 
other than our allowance for sales returns  the only estimates that we have to make regarding revenue recognition pertain to the collectability of the resulting receivable  both of which are discussed below 
we grant price protection rights to certain international distributors 
such price protection rights require us to pay the distributor if there is a reduction in the list price of our products 
price protection payments would be required for the distributor s inventory on hand or in transit on the date of the price reduction  for a period not to exceed days prior to the date of the price reduction 
we have not recorded a liability in connection with such price protection rights as we have never reduced the list prices of our products 
in september  we entered into a licensing agreement  as amended in december  with rohto see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  a large japan based company that specializes in the distribution and marketing of otc medical oriented products in the drug store and retail channels 
in january  we entered into a licensing agreement with tokyo beauty center  a diversified japanese consumer products and services company  which also owns and operates a large chain of aesthetic spas in japan 
royalty revenue is recognized as earned and is based upon a predetermined rate within the respective licensing agreement 
as noted earlier  during the year ended december   we entered the pharmacy channel for the first time by launching soluclenz rx gel  which was available only by prescription 
we sold soluclenz to pharmaceutical wholesalers  who had the right to return purchased product prior to the units being dispensed through patient prescriptions 
on april   we announced that we would no longer sell soluclenz in the pharmacy channel 
revenue for this product was recognized in accordance with asc among its criteria for revenue recognition from sale transactions where a buyer has a right of return  asc requires the amount of future returns to be reasonably estimated 
as substantially all of the risks and rewards of ow nership did not transfer upon shipment  we treated the sale of product under a consignment model 
under this consignment model  we did not recognize revenue upon the shipment of product with the guaranteed sale provision and accounted for inventory held by the wholesalers as consignment inventory 
due to our limited experience in the pharmacy channel  we were unable to reasonably estimate customer returns and  therefore  only recognized revenue related to soluclenz units once the units had been dispensed through patient prescriptions because units dispensed to patients were not subject to return 
we obtained actual prescription units dispensed based on distribution channel data provided by external  independent sources 
in connection with our exit from the pharmacy channel  during the year ended december   revenue for the remaining units dispensed during the period was fully recognized as we informed our soluclenz distributors that we were no longer going t o issue credit for returned inventory 
sales returns and allowances 
when we sell our products  we reduce the amount of revenue recognized from such sales by an estimate of future product returns and other sales allowances 
sales allowances include cash discounts  rebates and sales incentives relating to products sold in the current period 
factors that are considered in our estimates of sales returns include the historical rate of returns as a percentage of net product sales  gross of returns and allowances and shipping and handling revenue  historical aging of returns and the current market conditions 
although our domestic sales agreements do not provide for a contractual right of return  we maintain a return policy that allows our customers to return product within a sp ecified period after shipment of the product has occurred 
factors that are considered in our estimates regarding sales allowances include quality of product and recent promotional activity 
if actual future experience for product returns and other sales allowances exceeds the estimates we made at the time of sale  our financial position  results of operations and cash flow would be negatively impacted 
to date  such provisions have approximated management s estimates 
accounts receivable 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of current credit information 
receivables are generally due within days 
however  the recent recession and ongoing tightening of credit in financial markets has  in some cases  adversely impacted our customers cash flow and ability to access sufficient credit in a timely manner  which  in turn  has impacted their ability to make timely payments to us 
in light of these circumstances  and in order to remain competitive in the marketplace  for certain selected customers who we deemed to be creditworthy based upon their pri or payment history  we extended our standard payment terms to net days for selected product purchases made in connection with specific sales promotion programs 
such extension did not represent a permanent change to the payment terms for such customers but  rather  was applicable only to those specified purchases made by such customers in connection with the related sales promotion 
we deem a receivable to be past due when it has not been paid in accordance with the terms of the applicable invoice eg  net days or net days prepared at the time of sale 
accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
of these amounts   or million  and  or million  were deemed current as of december  and  respectively 
the percentage of accounts receivable deemed more than days past due as of december  and was and  respectively 
the percentage of accounts receivable deemed more than days past due as of december  and was for both periods 
we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical write offs as a percentage of product sales  adjusted specifically for accounts that are past due  non performing  in bankruptcy or otherwise identified as at risk for potential credit loss 
receivables are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts when an account is deemed to be uncollectible  taking into consideration the financial condition of the customer and the value of any collateral 
as of december  we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts to million  from million at december  the increase was primarily related to a non performing international distributor see note in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
recoveries of receivables previously charged off as uncollectible are credited to the allowance 
on an annual basis  customers with significant purchases are reviewed for their creditworthiness 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments and if the uncollectible balances exceed our estimates as of the balance sheet date  we would need to charge additional receivables to our allowances  and our financial position  results of operation and cash flow would be negatively impacted 
our credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowance established 
inventory 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market  computed at standard cost on a first in  first out basis and market being determined as the lower of replacement cost or net realizable value 
inventory reserves are established when conditions indicate that the selling price could be less than cost due to physical deterioration  usage  obsolescence  reductions in estimated future demand and reductions in selling prices 
inventory reserves are measured as the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value 
inventory reserves are charged to cost of sales and establish a lower cost basis for the inventory 
we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels with the risk of obs olescence due to changing technology  new product offerings and customer demand levels 
unfavorable changes in market conditions may result in a need for additional inventory reserves that could adversely impact our gross margins 
conversely  favorable changes in demand could result in higher gross margins 
to date  actual reserve requirements have approximated management s estimates 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
effective january   we adopted authoritative guidance issued by the fasb  which requires  among other things  the use of a nonamortization approach for purchased goodwill and certain intangibles 
under a nonamortization approach  goodwill and intangibles having an indefinite life are not amortized  but instead will be reviewed for impairment at least annually or earlier if an event occurs or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may be impaired 
events or circumstances that could indicate impairment include a significant change in the business climate  economic and industry trends  legal factors  negative operating performance indicator s  significant competition  changes in our strategy or disposition of a reporting unit or a portion thereof 
goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level 
the guidance under asc  intangibles goodwill and other asc  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwi ll impairment test compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to such reporting units  assignment of goodwill to such reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
this requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting un it 
we have selected september as the date on which we perform our annual goodwill impairment test 
we attribute the entire balance of our goodwill of million to our largest operating segment  which is also a reporting unit  the physician dispensed segment 
our determination of fair value of our goodwill considered the current and future economic  market  competitive conditions  and other relevant factors 
we evaluated the fair value of our goodwill using two approaches 
for the first approach  we derived valuation multiples from historical earnings data of guideline companies within our industry that compete in the physician dispensed market  and then evaluated and adjusted the multiples based on our strengths and weaknesses relative to the guideline companies 
the deriv ed multiples were then applied to our operating data to arrive at an indication of fair value 
cash free invested capital multiples  representing a marketable  minority interest  were calculated for the guideline companies as of september  revenue and earnings multiples were based on a valuation of the guideline companies profit margins  historical growth patterns  and a review of our own market factors  primarily related to our physician dispensed business 
the second approach  the discounted cash flow method  focused on the expected cash flows of our physician dispensed business 
we evaluated earnings projections through  trending the growth down to in the terminal year 
the discount rate for our physician dispensed business was determined by utilizing a weighted average cost of capital analysis  which analyzed long term government bonds  the moody s seasoned baa bond rate  the cost of equity of similar companies relative to our physician dispensed business  as well as our capital structure 
both methods were weighted at 
the analyses concluded that the fair value of our physician dispensed segment significantly exceeded the carrying amount of our goodwill 
there were no impairment triggers subsequent to september  as such  based on our analyses  no impairment charges were recognized for the years ended december   and other intangible assets consist of trademarks  distribution rights  covenants not to compete  patents  customer lists  and proprietary formulations 
other intangible assets are amortized over the expected period of benefit using the straight line method over the following lives trademarks years  distribution rights ten years  covenants not to compete seven years  and other intangible assets three to years 
in accordance with asc  long lived assets including intangible assets that are amortized are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  such as a significant sustained change in the business climate  during the interim periods 
if an indicator of impairment exists for any grouping of assets  an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows is compared to the asset group s carrying value 
if an asset is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows 
there were no indicators of impairment noted during  therefore no tests were performed for long lived assets 
any unfavorable changes in market conditions or our product lines may result in the impairment of goodwill or an intangible asset  which could adversely impact our net income 
leases 
we account for leases under the guidance of asc  leases  which requires that our leases be evaluated and classified as either operating leases or capital leases for financial reporting purposes 
minimum base rents for our operating leases  which generally have scheduled rent increases over the term of the lease  are recorded on a straight line basis over the lease term 
the initial lease term includes the period from when we are given access and control over the lease property  whether or not rent payments are due under the terms of the lease 
for leases with renewal periods at our option  we generally consider the lease term to consist of the initial lease term  as exercise of the renewal options as determined at lease inception is not considered to be reasonably assured 
however  if failure to exercise a renewal option imposes an economic penalty of sufficient magnitude to us  then the renewal  at inception  is reasonably assured and will be included in the determination of the appropriate lease term 
in certain instances  we disburse cash for leasehold improvements  furnishings  fixtures and equipment to renovate leased premises 
if costs are paid directly by the landlord or reimbursed to us by the landlord  we record a deferred rent liability and amortize the deferred rent liability over the lease term as a reduction to rent expense 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the guidance under asc  compensation asc 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards at the date of grant using any valuation model requires judgment 
we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultim ately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
we estimated our options expected terms in accordance with asc  using our best estimate of the period of time from the grant date that we expect the options to remain outstanding 
if we determine that another method to estimate expected volatility or expected term yields a more accurate estimate than our current methods  or if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance  the fair value calculated for stock based awards could change significantly 
higher volatility and expected terms result in an increase to stock based compensation determined at the date of grant 
the expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return are not as significant to the calculation of fair value 
uncertainty in income taxes 
the provisions under asc prescribe a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
only tax positions meeting the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized upon adoption of this interpretation 
the provisions also provide guidance on accounting for derecognition  interest and penalties  and classification and disclosure of matters related to uncertainty in income taxes 
as of december   the liability for unrecognized tax benefits was million 
results of operations the year ended december  compared the year ended december  net sales 
the following table compares net sales by product line and certain selected products for the years ended december  and our sales previously reported in the pharmacy rx operating segment are now classified as physician dispensed as part of the therapeutic product category 
prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 
year ended december  change net sales by product category physician dispensed nu derm vitamin c elasticity therapeutic other total licensing fees total net sales united states international net sales increased by million to million during the year ended december   as compared to million during the year ended december  overall  we believe our growth during the year ended december  is primarily due to a larger base of active accounts  higher level of patient visits due to increased consumer confidence versus last year  the launch of new products and the average price increase of on our products implemented on january physician dispensed sales increased million to million during the year ended december   as compared to million during the year ended december  we experienced an increase in the majority of our product categories as follows i an increase in vitamin c of million  of which million was attributable to our normal to oily line extension of obagi c rx launched in january  ii an increase in nu derm sales of million  iii a million increase in elasticity sales  of which million was attributable to the launch of our elastilash product in october  and iv an increase in the other category of million 
the growth in the other category was primarily attributable to the launch of refissa in september  which accounted for millio n of the increase 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in the therapeutic category 
the decline in the therapeutic category was primarily attributable to the increased promotional activity surrounding the launch of our rosaclear product in january and our exit of the pharmacy channel in april licensing fees decreased by million due to a decline in unit sales by our japanese partner rohto during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  our aggregate sales growth was composed of million in the us  partially offset by a million decrease from our international markets and a decline in licensing fees of million 
the decline in international sales was primarily due to declines in the therapeutic and other product categories and was principally a result of a million decrease in the far east region  partially offset by i a million increase in the middle east  ii a million increase from the americas  and iii a million increase from the europe and other regions 
despite the growth we have experienced during the fiscal year  we believe that the ongoing economic uncertainty could negatively impact our future net sales 
gross margin percentage 
our gross margin percentage increased slightly to for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  the overall increase is primarily attributable to an increase in gross margin for our physician dispensed segment  which increased to compared to for the same period last year 
the improvement was primarily a result of i an increase in sales volumes primarily in our nu derm and vitamin c product categories  ii an average price increase of on our products implemented on january   and a iii a decrease in sales volumes in our therapeutic products  which have a lower margin than most of our other product categories  partially offset by a mill ion increase in product costs  largely in our other product category 
our gross margin for our licensing segment increased slightly to compared to for the same period last year 
cost of sales also includes outbound shipping and handling  work order scrap  licensing and royalty fees related to licensed intellectual property  depreciation and amortization attributable to products sold  and an inventory reserve for shrinkage and write downs 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs  professional fees  insurance costs  stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization not attributable to products sold  warehousing costs  marketing costs  travel expenses  general and administrative support expenses and other selling expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million during the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the following i million in expenses for matters related to dr 
obagi  including expenses related to pending litigation of approximately million and million related to the termination of the agreement dated as of june  agreement  in september  which includes the write off of prepaid rent and leasehold improvements at a beverly hills location leased by us  ii a million increase in salaries and related expenses due to an increase in sales commissions  accrued bonus and an increase in marketing and sales force headcount  iii million in severance and other related charges in connection with the departure of steven r 
carlson  our former president and chief executive officer  in october  iv a million increase in other marketing expenses primarily due to the launch of elastilash in october  v a million increase in promotions and training expenses  vi million in expenses related to our secondary offering completed in november  vii a million increase in expenses related to our third party logistics provider  viii a million increase in other expenses  million of which was due to losses on disposal of fixed assets  ix a million increase in volume driven expenses  and x a million increase in product development expenses 
these increases were partially offset by i a million decrease in soluclenz related expenses as a result of our exit from the pharmacy channel  of which million was due to the distribution and support of the product in the pharmacy channel and million was due to the write off of nonrefundable deposits and the accrual of other contract termination costs  ii a million d ecrease in professional fees  iii a million decrease in depreciation and amortization  iv a million decrease in non cash compensation  v a million decrease in expenses driven by being a public company  and vi a million decrease in rent expense 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  increased to as compared to for the year ended december  we hope to minimize additional operating costs in fiscal year  including professional fees where possible 
we intend to maintain or decrease selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  during we recorded million in accelerated advisory and related fees pursuant to the termination of the agreement with dr 
obagi 
in addition  salaries and related expenses increased million 
these increases were offset by i a million decrease in expenses related to the development of line extensions and reformulations of existing products  ii a million decrease in expenses related to the development of new products  and iii million in grant funds received under the qualifying ther apeutic discovery grant program administered by the internal revenue service and the department of health and human services in support of the company s development of nu derm for the treatment of melasma  which were recorded as an offset to research and development expense 
as a percentage of net sales  research and development costs in the year ended december  were as compared to in the year ended december  loss on dissolution of foreign subsidiary 
on june   we dissolved our majority owned subsidiary  obagi s pte ltd

as in the prior year  the effective tax rate includes the tax benefit derived from the research and development credit during the year ended december  the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to certain costs incurred during the secondary offering and stock repurchase completed in nove mber not being deductible for tax purposes during the year ended december the year ended december  compared the year ended december  net sales

the us economic slowdown effect was more pronounced within the nu derm and elasticity product lines 
physician dispensed sales decreased million to million during the year ended december   as compared to million during the year ended december  the decline was due to the following i a decline in nu derm sales of million  primarily as a result of the us economic slowdown  ii a million decline in elasticity sales  partially due to the increased promotional activity surrounding the launch of our elastiderm d colletage product in as compared to  offset in part by i a total increase of million in therapeutic sales  and ii an increase of million in the other category

the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in state taxes during the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources trends and uncertainties affecting liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are our cash generated by operations and availability under our credit and term loan agreement 
as of december  we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and million available under the facility and term loans 
we currently believe that our existing cash balances and cash generated by operations  together with our available credit capacity  will enable us to meet foreseeable liquidity requirements

on august   the board of directors gave us the authority to repurchase up to million of our outstanding common stock  which expired on august  during the years ended december  and  we purchased million and million of our outstanding stock  respectively  and the legal costs associated with the litigation and arbitration demand involving us and dr 
ob agi see note in our notes to consolidated financial statements could be material regardless of the outcome 
we are operating in an uncertain and volatile economic environment  which could have unanticipated adverse effects on our business 
the pharmaceutical industry has been impacted by the volatility in the financial markets  including declines in stock prices  and by uncertain economic conditions 
increases in food and fuel prices  changes in the availability of consumer credit and housing markets  actual and potential job losses among many sectors of the economy  significant declines in the stock market resulting in large losses to consumer retirement and investment accounts  and uncertainty regarding future federal tax and economic policies have all added to declines in consumer confidence and curtailed consumer spending 
the recent recession and ongoing tightening of credit in financial markets has  in some cases  adversely impacted our customers cash flow and ability to access sufficient credit in a timely manner  which  in turn  has impacted their ability to make timely payments to us 
in light of these circumstances  and in order to remain competitive in the marketplace  for certain selected customers who we deemed to be creditworthy based upon their prior payment history  we extended our standard payment terms from net days to net days for selected product purchases made in connection with certain sales promotion programs 
such extension did not represent a permanent change to the payment terms for such customers but  rather  was applicable only to specified purchases made by such customers in connection with the applicable sales promotion program 
sales of products having net day payment terms represented of our net sales for the year ended december  it is unclear how long the current economic environment will continue  whether there will be new events that could contribute to additional deterioration  and if so  what effect such events could have on our business in we intend to continue to moderate our growth plans and avoid substantial credit and market risk 
we expect to continue to generate positive working capital through our operations 
as of december   we had no outstanding balance on the facility or term loans 
we were in compliance with all financial and non financial covenants under the credit and term loan agreement as of december  we expect to be in compliance with both our non financial and financial covenants during  however economic conditions or the occurrence of any of the events discussed above under risk factors could cause noncompliance within our financial covenants 
we expect to be able to manage our working capital levels and capital expenditure amounts to maintain sufficient levels of liquidity 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  in working capital 
we invested approximately million in capital expenditures during the year ended december   which largely consisted of software and it upgrades 
in  we expect to spend approximately million in capital expenditures  primarily related to software and it upgrades and disaster recovery 
cash requirements for our business historically  we have generated cash from operations in excess of working capital requirements and through private and public sales of common stock 
we currently invest our cash and cash equivalents in large money market funds and certificates of deposit with maturities no greater than one year 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
on november  we entered into a credit and term loan agreement with comerica bank 
the credit and term loan agreement replaced and terminated our previous million former credit facility  dated november   which was scheduled to terminate on november  the company did not have any outstanding balance on the former credit facility at the time of termination 
under the credit and term loan agreement  we have access to i up to million in a revolving credit facility  and ii one or more term loans in an aggregate amount of up to million until the earliest to occur of a the date the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the term loans equals million  b may   or c the date of our request to close out the term loans 
the facility will terminate  and any amounts outstanding under the facility will be due on july  and all amounts outstanding under the terms loans will be due five years after the last day we request to close out the term loans  unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions of the credit and term loan agreement 
any borrowings under the credit and term loan agreement will bear variable interest based on a margin  at our option  over prime rate or libor as defined in the credit and term loan agreement 
all amounts borrowed under the credit and term loan agreement are secured by a first priority security interest in all of our tangible and intangible assets 
the credit and term loan agreement contains certain financial and non financial covenants 
non financial covenants include  among other things  monthly and quarterly reporting of a listing of our intellectual property 
financial covenants include requirements for maintaining i a minimum quick ratio  ii a maximum ratio of total liabilities to tangible effective net worth  and iii a minimum ebitda amount  as well as limitations on a annual capital expenditures  b asset or equity based investments  c stock repurchases  which may not exceed million  d dividend distributions  which may not exceed of net income for the fiscal year  and e joint venture investments  which may not exceed million 
see below for covenant compliance as of requirement facility covenants minimum quick ratio maximum ratio of total liabilities to tangible effective net worth minimum ebitda million million maximum stock repurchase million million maximum dividend distribution million maximum capital expenditures million million as of december   we had no outstanding balance on the facility or term loans 
we were in compliance with all financial and non financial debt covenants under the credit and term loan agreement as of december  if we do not draw on the term loans on or before may   the million under the term loans will no longer be available to us 
however  we do intend to amend the credit and term loan agreement to extend the draw period of the term loans 
on october   we announced that our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million of our common stock  depending on market conditions and other factors 
share repurchases could include the repurchase of shares from the selling stockholders in connection with the secondary offering completed in november  as well as repurchases made through open market or privately negotiated transactions in compliance with sec rule b  subject to market conditions  applicable legal requirements and other factors 
this authorization does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock nor does it ensure that any shares will be repurchased  and it may be suspended at any time at our discretion 
during the fourth quarter ended december   we repurchased  shares of our outstanding common stock for a cost of million 
on august   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common  which expired on august  the purchases were to be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements 
the timing manner  price and amount of any repurchases were determined by a three person committee  consisting of members of our board and management  at its discretion  and were subject to economic and market conditions  stock price  applicable legal requirements and other factors  and could be discontinued at any time 
during the years ended december  and  we purchased  and  shares of our outstanding stock  respectively  for a cost of million and mi llion  respectively 
we continually evaluate new opportunities for products or therapeutic systems and  if and when appropriate  intend to pursue such opportunities through the acquisitions of companies  products or technologies and our own development activities 
our ability to execute on such opportunities in some circumstances may be dependent  in part  upon our ability to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms 
there can be no assurance that funds from these sources will be available when needed or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience additional dilution or such equity securities may provide for righ ts  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
inflation although at reduced levels in recent years  inflation continues to apply upward pressure on the cost of goods and services that we use 
the competitive environments in many markets substantially limit our ability to fully recover these higher costs through increased selling prices 
we continually seek to mitigate the adverse effects of inflation through cost containment and improved productivity and manufacturing processes 
foreign currency fluctuations approximately of our net sales in were derived from operations outside the united states and were denominated in japanese yen 
none of our international cost structure is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  we are subject to fluctuations in sales and earnings reported in us dollars due to changing currency exchange rates 
we do not believe  however  that we currently have significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk and have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies

in addition  the purchase of the shares by us was conditioned on the sale of shares in the secondary offering

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our excess cash primarily in large money market funds and certificates of deposit with maturity dates no greater than one year 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion 
accordingly  we believe that we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
although substantially all of our sales and purchases are denominated in us dollars  future fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may affect the price competitiveness of our products outside the us we do not believe  however  that we currently have significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk and have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies

changes in us libor interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
at december   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents 
if the interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents were to increase or decrease by for the year  annual interest income would increase or decrease by approximately million 
other risks the recent recession has had an adverse impact on the financial services industry  including insurance companies  some of whom provide insurance coverage to us 
to the extent we have any claims in the future and such insurance providers are unable  due to their financial condition  to pay covered claims  we could experience adverse impacts on our cash flow and cash reserves 
we have no way of knowing whether or not any insurance providers that are financially stable at this time will experience financial difficulties in the future that could impact their ability to pay covered claims
