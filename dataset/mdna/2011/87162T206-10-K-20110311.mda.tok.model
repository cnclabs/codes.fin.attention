item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements  related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview synta pharmaceuticals corp 
is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing  and commercializing small molecule drugs to extend and enhance the lives of patients with severe medical conditions  including cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases 
we have two drug candidates in clinical trials for treating multiple types of cancer and several drug candidates in the preclinical stage of development 
each of our drug candidates was discovered and developed internally using our proprietary  unique chemical compound library and integrated discovery engine 
we have granted hoffman la roche  or roche  an exclusive license to develop and commercialize certain compounds from our calcium release activated calcium modulator  or cracm  program resulting from our research partnership with them 
we retain full ownership of all of our other drug candidates 
we believe that our competitive advantages include the broad clinical and commercial potential of our drug candidates  the strength of our intellectual property portfolio  consisting of over issued and pending patents  our proprietary chemical compound library and the strength of our drug discovery platform  with which we have generated all of our drug candidates  our ability to integrate discovery  translational  and clinical research to optimize our scientific and clinical choices and further strengthen our intellectual property position  our operational experience in effectively managing large scale  global clinical programs  the full ownership of our programs  which creates strategic flexibility in partnership discussions that can be used to enhance the value we may ultimately capture from our drug candidates  our strong network of relationships with leading investigators and institutions  which facilitates our ability to conduct clinical trials efficiently  and the skills  talent  and level of industry experience of our employees 
we believe that these competitive advantages provide us with multiple  sustainable growth opportunities 
we were incorporated in march and commenced operations in july since that time  we have been principally engaged in the discovery and development of novel drug candidates 
we have funded our operations principally with million in net proceeds from private and public offerings of our common stock and series a convertible preferred stock  including million in net proceeds from the sale of  shares of our common stock at per share in an underwritten public offering that was completed in january and million in net proceeds from the direct sale of  shares of our common stock at per share to a director and largest existing stockholder  that was completed in november  as well as million in gross proceeds from a term loan that was executed in september with general electric capital corporation  or gecc  and one other lender referred to herein as the gecc term loan 
in october  we entered into a common share purchase agreement  or purchase agreement  with azimuth opportunity ltd  or azimuth  pursuant to which we obtained a committed equity line of credit facility  or facility  under which we may sell up to a maximum of million or  shares of our common stock  whichever is fewer  over the month term of the agreement  subject to certain conditions and limitations 
in addition to raising capital from financing activities  we have also received substantial capital from partnering activities 
in october  we entered into a global collaborative development  commercialization and license agreement with glaxosmithkline  or gsk  for the joint development and commercialization of elesclomol  one of our oncology drug candidates  which we refer to as the gsk agreement 
on june   following the suspension of our global phase clinical trial of elesclomol plus paclitaxel in metastatic melanoma  called the symmetry trial  we received written notice from gsk of their intent to terminate the gsk agreement 
the collaboration terminated on september  in december  as amended in february and february  we entered into a collaborative license agreement with roche  or the roche agreement  for our cracm inhibitor program  which is currently in the preclinical stage 
as of december   we have received million in nonrefundable partnership payments under these agreements with gsk and with roche  including million in upfront payments  million in operational milestones and million in research and development funding  which  together with the net cash proceeds from equity financings  the gecc term loan and the exercise of common stock warrants and options  provided aggregate net cash proceeds of approximately million 
we have also generated funds from government grants  equipment lease financings and investment income 
we are engaged in preliminary partnership discussions for a number of our programs  which may provide us with additional financial resources if consummated 
we have devoted substantially all of our capital resources to the research and development of our drug candidates 
since our inception  we have had no revenues from product sales 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance our drug candidates from discovery through preclinical development and clinical trials  and seek regulatory approval and eventual commercialization 
we will need to generate significant revenues from product sales to achieve future profitability and may never do so 
oncology programs we have two clinical stage programs and one preclinical stage program in oncology ganetespib hsp inhibitor ganetespib formerly sta is a potent  synthetic  small molecule inhibitor of hsp  a chaperone protein that is essential to the function of certain other proteins  for example tyrosine kinases that drive the growth  proliferation  and survival of many different types of cancer 
many of the known oncogenic proteins that play major roles in pathogenesis of solid tumor and hematologic malignancies are client proteins of hsp by inhibiting hsp  ganetespib causes the degradation of these client proteins and the subsequent death of cancer cells dependent on these proteins 
ganetespib is structurally unrelated to the ansamycin family of first generation hsp inhibitors such as aag and ipi and has shown superior activity to these agents in preclinical studies 
in clinical trials to date  ganetespib has shown encouraging evidence of clinical activity  including prolonged tumor shrinkage in patients who have progressed after  or failed to respond to  treatment with commonly used drugs for these tumors 
currently  over patients have been treated with ganetespib across all trials 
ganetespib has been well tolerated to date  with no evidence of the serious liver or common ocular toxicities seen with other hsp inhibitors 
the most common adverse event seen with ganetespib is diarrhea  which has been manageable and reversible with standard supportive care 
ganetespib is currently being evaluated in eleven phase clinical trials  with several additional trials expected to initiate in  both as a single agent  or monotherapy  and in combination with other therapies 
in  we initiated nine clinical trials  including a phase company sponsored clinical trial of ganetespib in combination with docetaxel in solid tumors and eight investigator sponsored trials  or ists  which include a phase trial in hepatic cancer and seven phase trials in colon  gastric  ocular melanoma  pancreatic  prostate  breast and small cell lung cancers 
in january  we announced that the multiple myeloma research foundation will provide funding of up to million for a phase trial evaluating ganetespib as a single agent and in combination with velcade for the treatment of relapsed multiple myeloma 
we expect this trial to begin in the second half of in addition  we expect to initiate several additional ists that will evaluate ganetespib in other tumor types or in combination with additional chemotherapy or targeted agents 
we are planning to initiate a phase b trial in nsclc of ganetespib plus docetaxel versus docetaxel alone in the second quarter of this trial is being designed as a registration enabling program with two stages 
the first stage is an approximately patient phase b portion designed to establish the clinical benefit and safety profile of ganetespib in combination with docetaxel relative to docetaxel alone 
this part of the trial is expected to require million or less in external costs in the first stage of this trial will be used to build the clinical and operational experience needed to optimize the design of the second stage  phase portion of the trial 
for example  we may use information obtained in the phase b stage of the trial to refine patient inclusion exclusion criteria to enrich the phase portion with those patients that show the greatest benefit from the addition of ganetespib 
the second stage  phase portion of the trial is expected to enroll between to patients 
we are currently developing a new series of hsp inhibitor compounds that may be orally administered and may be more suitable for long term treatment settings such as adjuvant or maintenance therapy in oncology 
we have also characterized additional small molecule  injectable hsp inhibitors that provide options for future development 
these compounds are in the lead optimization stage 
elesclomol mitochondria targeting agent elesclomol is a first in class  investigational drug candidate that triggers programmed cell death  or apoptosis  in cancer cells through a novel mechanism disrupting cancer cell mitochondrial metabolism 
results from three randomized clinical trials and subsequent research have established that the patient baseline serum level of lactate dehydrogenase  or ldh  is an important predictor of elesclomol treatment outcome 
elesclomol is currently in a phase clinical trial in ovarian cancer in combination with paclitaxel and a phase clinical trial in acute myeloid leukemia  or aml  as a single agent 
in the second quarter of  we plan to initiate a phase b trial for elesclomol in nsclc with a trial design similar to our prior phase b trial for elesclomol in nsclc 
this new trial  which is expected to enroll approximately patients  would prospectively specify that only patients with low to normal ldh levels will be enrolled 
this trial will include a dose escalation and safety portion to optimize the dose selection for the phase b portion 
we expect the randomized phase b portion to begin in the fourth quarter of gsk elesclomol alliance in october  as amended in june  we entered into the gsk agreement for the joint development and commercialization of elesclomol under which we received nonrefundable payments  including an million upfront license fee and million in operational milestone payments 
on june   following the suspension of the symmetry trial  we received written notice from gsk of their intent to terminate the gsk agreement 
the termination of the gsk agreement was effective on september  in accordance with the termination provisions of the gsk agreement  all rights to the elesclomol program have been returned to us as of the effective date of termination 
we may continue to develop elesclomol alone or with another partner 
under the termination provisions in the gsk agreement  we may be required to pay gsk a low single digit royalty on future sales of elesclomol 
sta vascular disrupting agent sta is a novel  injectable  small molecule compound that appears to disrupt the blood vessels that supply tumors with oxygen and essential nutrients  and is in preclinical development 
in november  we announced that the united states department of defense recommended funding of sta  in the amount of approximately million  for study in advanced prostate cancer 
we anticipate initiating work supported by this grant during the first half of our inflammatory disease programs we have two preclinical stage programs focusing on treatments for inflammatory diseases 
both of our inflammatory disease programs focus on oral  disease modifying drug candidates that act through novel mechanisms and could potentially target multiple indications 
cracm ion channel inhibitors we have developed novel  small molecule inhibitors of cracm ion channels expressed on immune cells 
our cracm ion channel inhibitors have shown strong antiinflammatory activity in preclinical studies both in vitro and in vivo  inhibiting t cell and mast cell activity  including cytokine release  degranulation  and immune cell proliferation 
potential applications include a wide range of inflammatory diseases and disorders for which modulating t cell and mast cell function has been shown to be critical  including rheumatoid arthritis  or ra  asthma  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  or copd  allergy  transplant rejection  and other autoimmune diseases and inflammatory conditions 
as part of our strategic alliance with roche  roche is advancing several compounds in preclinical development 
we have several cracm inhibitors  which are not licensed to roche  in lead optimization 
because there are a number of cracm ion channel targets on immune cells  we believe that our next generation cracm inhibitor compounds could potentially apply to different immune system diseases and address distinct therapeutic areas  such as ra  allergy  asthma  and transplant rejection 
roche cracm inhibitor alliance in december  we formed a strategic alliance with roche to discover  develop  and commercialize small molecule drugs targeting cracm channels 
we refer herein to the agreement  as amended in february and february  as the roche agreement 
the goal of this alliance is to develop a novel category of oral  disease modifying agents for the treatment of ra and other autoimmune diseases and inflammatory conditions 
under the terms of the roche agreement  we received a million non refundable upfront license fee 
roche funded research and development conducted by us  which included discovery and certain early development activities 
as of december   we have received approximately million in research and development support under the roche agreement 
roche received worldwide rights to develop and commercialize certain products  referred to as licensed compounds  which were identified and studied prior to the end of the two year research term that concluded on december  we do not expect to earn any cost sharing revenue or receive any additional research and development support under the roche agreement in roche is responsible for development and commercialization of the licensed compounds  while we retain certain co development and co promotion rights 
we are also eligible to receive additional payments  for each of three licensed compounds  should specified development and commercialization milestones be successfully achieved 
development milestones across multiple indications of up to million could be earned for the first product  and up to half of this amount could be earned for each of the second and third products 
commercialization milestones of up to million could be earned for each of three products 
we will also receive tiered royalties on sales of all approved  marketed products containing licensed compounds 
in the february amendment of the roche agreement  we extended the term of the research license for roche to continue performing research on certain specified compounds until june  that amendment also provided for the return to us of certain licensed compounds 
we retain all development and commercialization rights for our cracm inhibitor compounds other than the specific licensed compounds licensed to roche under the roche agreement 
il inhibitors we have identified several small molecule il inhibitors that represent a promising opportunity to develop drug candidates that could be administered orally and potentially address a wide range of serious inflammatory diseases with high unmet medical needs 
financial operations overview revenue we have not yet generated any product revenue and do not expect to generate any product revenue in the foreseeable future  if at all 
our revenues have been generated primarily through partnership agreements with gsk and roche 
the terms of these agreements include payment to us of upfront license fees  milestone payments  research and development cost sharing and royalties 
we will seek to generate revenue from product sales and from future collaborative or strategic relationships 
upfront license payments and milestones are recognized ratably as collaboration revenue using the time based model over the estimated performance period and any changes in the estimated performance period could result in substantial changes to the period over which these revenues are recognized see critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition 
in the future  we expect any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of payments received and expenses incurred under future collaborations or strategic relationships  and the amount and timing of payments we receive upon the sale of our drug candidates  to the extent any are successfully commercialized 
research and development research and development expense consists of costs incurred in connection with developing and advancing our drug discovery technology and identifying and developing our drug candidates 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
our research and development expense consists of internal costs associated with research  preclinical and clinical activities  payments to third party contract research organizations  investigative sites and consultants in connection with our preclinical and clinical development programs  costs associated with drug formulation and supply of drugs for clinical trials  personnel related expenses  including salaries  stock based compensation  benefits and travel  and overhead expenses  including rent and maintenance of our facilities  and laboratory and other supplies 
we do not know if we will be successful in developing our drug candidates 
we believe that accurately projecting total program specific expenses through commercialization is not possible at this time 
the timing and amount of these expenses will depend upon the costs associated with potential future clinical trials of our drug candidates  and the related expansion of our research and development organization  regulatory requirements  advancement of our preclinical programs and product manufacturing costs  many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development 
this is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the duration and cost of clinical trials  which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of unanticipated events arising during clinical development  including with respect to the number of clinical sites included in the trial  the length of time required to enroll suitable subjects  the number of subjects that ultimately participate in the trials  and the efficacy and safety results of our clinical trials and the number of additional required clinical trials 
our expenditures are subject to additional uncertainties  including the terms and timing of regulatory approvals and the expense of filing  prosecuting  defending or enforcing any patent claims or other intellectual property rights 
in addition  we may obtain unexpected or unfavorable results from our clinical trials 
we may elect to discontinue  delay or modify clinical trials of some drug candidates or focus on others 
a change in the outcome of any of the foregoing variables in the development of a drug candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that drug candidate 
for example  if the fda or other regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate  or if we experience significant delays in any of our clinical trials  we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development 
additionally  future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will evolve and therefore impact our clinical development programs and plans over time 
in  we anticipate that our overall research and development expenses for personnel and external costs will increase as we further advance the clinical development of ganetespib and elesclomol 
however  these increases will be offset in part due to the anticipated lower investment in cracm research following the conclusion on december  of the initial two year research term under the roche agreement 
beyond our current lead drug candidates  we anticipate that we will select drug candidates and research projects for further development on an ongoing basis in response to their preclinical and clinical success  as well as commercial potential 
general and administrative general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel in executive  finance  business and commercial development  investor and medical community relations  human resources and administrative functions 
other costs include stock based compensation costs  directors and officers liability insurance premiums  legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property  fees for general legal  accounting  public company requirements and compliance  and other professional services  as well as overhead related costs not otherwise included in research and development 
in  we anticipate our general and administrative expenses will remain at levels similar to restructuring on march   we committed to a restructuring plan that consisted primarily of an immediate workforce reduction of approximately positions  to a total of approximately positions  to align our workforce to our revised operating plans following the suspension of our symmetry clinical trial 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million for severance and estimated benefits continuation costs and outplacement services 
in addition  we paid approximately million in unused paid time off that had been recognized as expense prior to the restructuring  including million in the year ended december  and million in the first quarter of the approximate million in restructuring related payments for severance  unused paid time off  benefits and outplacement services was fully paid in to conserve additional capital resources  we did not renew one of our office building leases that expired in august and consolidated our operations within our three other facilities 
we did not incur an impairment charge in connection with the facility consolidation 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
we are required to make estimates and judgments with respect to contract research accruals  the recoverability of long lived assets  measurement of stock based compensation and the periods of performance under collaborative research and development agreements 
we base our estimates on historical experience  known trends and events  and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to aid in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
marketable securities marketable securities consist of investments in high grade corporate obligations that are guaranteed by the united states government  and government and government agency obligations that are classified as available for sale 
since these securities are available to fund current operations they are classified as current assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
we adjust the cost of available for sale debt securities for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
we include such amortization and accretion in interest and investment income 
realized gains and losses and declines in value  if any  that we judge to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are reported in interest and investment income 
to determine whether an other than temporary impairment exists  we consider whether we intend to sell the debt security and  if we do not intend to sell the debt security  we consider available evidence to assess whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis 
during the years ended december  and  we determined that no securities were other than temporarily impaired 
marketable securities are stated at fair value  including accrued interest  with their unrealized gains and losses included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  which is a separate component of stockholders equity 
the fair value of these securities is based on quoted market prices 
realized gains and losses are determined on the specific identification method 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded no realized gains or losses on marketable securities 
revenue recognition collaboration and license agreements our principal source of revenue is from collaborative research and development agreements  which may include upfront license payments  development milestones  reimbursement of research and development costs  profit sharing payments  sales milestones and royalties 
the application of accounting rules requires subjective analysis and requires management to make estimates and assumptions about whether deliverables within multiple element arrangements are separable from the other aspects of the contractual arrangement into separate units of accounting and to determine the fair value to be allocated to each unit of accounting 
we evaluate the multiple deliverables within our collaborations to determine whether the delivered elements that are our obligation have value to our collaborators on a stand alone basis and whether objective reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items exists 
deliverables that meet these criteria are considered a separate unit of accounting 
deliverables that do not meet these criteria are combined and accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
the appropriate recognition of revenue is then applied to each separate unit of accounting 
our deliverables under our collaboration agreements  including the related rights and obligations  contractual cash flows and performance periods  are more fully described in notes and of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
certain of the deliverables have been combined as a single unit of accounting 
the cash flows associated with the single unit of accounting from the research and development portions of our collaborations are recognized as revenue using a time based model 
under this model  cash flow streams are recognized as revenue over the estimated performance period 
upon achievement of milestones  as defined in the collaboration agreements  revenue is recognized to the extent the accumulated service time  if any  has occurred 
the remainder is deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the remaining estimated performance period 
a change in the period of time expected to complete the deliverable is accounted for as a change in estimate on a prospective basis 
revenue is limited to amounts that are non refundable and that our collaborators are contractually obligated to pay us 
royalty revenues are based upon a percentage of net sales 
royalties from the sales of products will be recorded on the accrual basis when results are reliably measurable  collectibility is reasonably assured and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
sales milestones  which are based upon the achievement of certain agreed upon sales thresholds  will be recognized in the period in which the respective sales threshold is achieved and collectibility is reasonably assured 
accrued expenses and accrued contract research liabilities as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf  and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
given our current business  the primary area of uncertainty concerning accruals which could have a material effect on our business is with respect to service fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical drug supplies and to contract research organizations in connection with our preclinical studies and clinical trials 
in connection with all of the foregoing service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided 
the majority of our service providers  including contract research organizations  invoice us in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify some costs which have begun to be incurred  or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services in a given period  our reported expenses for such period would be understated or overstated 
we currently reflect the over or under accrual of expenses directly in our operations in the period the amount was determined 
our arrangements with contract research organizations in connection with clinical trials often provide for payment prior to commencing the project or based upon predetermined milestones throughout the period during which services are expected to be performed 
we recognize expense relating to these arrangements based on the various services provided over the estimated time to completion 
the date on which services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of such services are often determined based on subjective judgments 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us based on the terms of the contract and our ongoing monitoring of service performance 
in the years ended december   and  respectively  we had arrangements with multiple contract research organizations whereby these organizations commit to performing services for us over multiple reporting periods 
we currently recognize and plan to continue to recognize the expenses associated with these arrangements based on our expectation of the timing of the performance of components under these arrangements by these organizations 
generally  these components consist of the costs of setting up the trial  monitoring the trial  closing the trial and preparing the resulting data 
costs related to patient enrollment in clinical trials are accrued as patients are enrolled in the trial 
with respect to financial reporting periods presented in this annual report on form k  and based on our receipt of invoices from our third party providers  the timing of our actual costs incurred have not differed materially from our estimated timing of such costs 
in light of the foregoing  we do not believe our estimates of future expenses and our practice of making judgments concerning the accrual of expenses are reasonably likely to change in the future 
there were no changes in our estimates and accruals for contract service fees that had a material effect on our net income loss for the years ended december   and  respectively 
stock based compensation we use the black scholes option pricing model as it is the most appropriate valuation method for our option grants 
the black scholes model requires inputs for risk free interest rate  dividend yield  volatility and expected lives of the options 
since we have a limited history of stock activity  expected volatility for the period from april  through december  was based upon the weighted average historical volatility data of our common stock and the historical volatility data of our common stock and the historical volatility data from several guideline public biotechnology companies similar in size and value to us that also have stock compensation plans with similar terms 
prior to april   expected volatility was based solely on historical data from several similar guideline public biotechnology companies with similar stock compensation plans and terms 
we will continue using our historical volatility and other similar public entity volatility information until our historical volatility alone is relevant to measure expected volatility for future option grants 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical data 
our options generally vest after one year of service and quarterly over three years thereafter 
based on an analysis of historical forfeitures  we applied a forfeiture rate of to all options that vest upon completion of the first year of service following the date of grant 
the analysis is re evaluated at least annually and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary 
the risk free interest rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant 
the expected lives for options granted represent the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
we use the simplified method for determining the expected lives of options 
for awards with graded vesting  we allocate compensation costs on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
accordingly  we amortize the fair value of each option over each option service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we account for stock options issued to non employees by valuing and remeasuring such stock options to the current fair value until the performance date has been reached 
our net income loss included compensation costs in the amount of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and no income tax benefit related to our stock based compensation arrangements for employee and non employee awards 
as of december   the total amount of unrecognized stock based compensation expense was million  which will be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
consolidated results of operations years ended december   and revenue years ended december  comparison comparison dollars in millions collaboration revenues license and milestone revenue roche license and milestone revenue gsk cost sharing reimbursements  net roche cost sharing reimbursements  net gsk total collaboration revenue grant revenue total revenues roche overview 
in december  as amended in february and february  we entered into a collaborative license agreement with roche to discover  develop  and commercialize small molecule drugs targeting cracm channels and received a million nonrefundable upfront payment from roche in january reimbursements of research and development costs to us by roche were recorded as cost sharing revenue in the period in which the related research and development costs were incurred 
the initial two year research term concluded on december  and  accordingly  we do not expect to earn any cost sharing revenue or receive any additional research and development support under the roche agreement in see notes and in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements 
in as compared to  cost sharing reimbursements from roche decreased by million due to the realignment of our resources to focus on advancing the research program  thereby shifting preclinical and clinical development to roche  as well as a corresponding lower level of research and development funding by roche 
in as compared to  we recognized a full year of license revenue in connection with the million nonrefundable upfront payment we received from roche in january and we began performing research and development services under the roche agreement 
gsk overview in october  as amended in june  we entered into a collaborative development  commercialization and license agreement with gsk for elesclomol  received an million nonrefundable upfront payment from gsk and achieved a total of million in nonrefundable operational milestones 
in  we began recognizing  as a reduction to revenue  net cost sharing reimbursements due to gsk for costs they incurred under the development program 
in  following the suspension of the company global phase clinical trial of elesclomol plus paclitaxel in metastatic melanoma  called the symmetry trial  gsk terminated the gsk agreement effective september  see notes and in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements 
in as compared to  no revenue related to gsk was recognized due to the termination of the gsk agreement in september in as compared to  license and milestone revenue recognized under the gsk agreement increased by million 
in the third quarter of  upon the effectiveness of the termination of the gsk agreement  we recognized approximately million of remaining deferred revenue from upfront payments and milestones  all of which were recorded as license and milestone revenue as we had no further obligation for deliverables under the gsk agreement 
also  in  cost sharing reimbursements related to gsk increased by million 
the requirement to pay the cumulative gsk cost sharing reimbursements did not survive termination of the gsk agreement and in the third quarter of  upon the effectiveness of the termination of the gsk agreement  we reversed approximately million of cost sharing reimbursement liabilities as collaboration revenue 
grant revenue in  we recognized grant revenue of million as compared to no grant revenue recognition in in november  we were informed that all four therapeutic discovery tax credit applications we submitted under the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act  or the healthcare reform act of  had been approved and that we had been awarded approximately million in grants 
these funds were received in december research and development expense years ended december  comparison comparison dollars in millions clinical stage drug candidates ganetespib elesclomol apilimod total clinical stage drug candidates cracm other early stage programs total research and development ganetespib in as compared to  costs incurred under our ganetespib program increased by million  principally including increases of million for personnel related costs  related research supplies  operational overhead and stock compensation  and million for external costs 
in as compared to  costs incurred under our ganetespib program increased by million  principally including increases of million for personnel related costs  related research supplies  operational overhead and stock compensation  and million for external costs 
these increases in and were principally due to the advancement of clinical development  including fifteen ongoing clinical trials as of december   the manufacture of supporting drug supply  and the evaluation of additional cancer types and planning activities in connection with future clinical trials 
in  we initiated nine clinical trials  including a phase company sponsored clinical trial of ganetespib in combination with docetaxel in solid tumors and eight investigator sponsored clinical trials  which include a phase trial in hepatic cancer and seven phase trials in colon  gastric  ocular melanoma  pancreatic  prostate  breast and small cell lung cancers 
in  we initiated four company sponsored clinical trials  including two phase clinical trials in hematologic cancers and two phase clinical trials in nsclc and gist 
in  we anticipate that the overall costs under our ganetespib program will continue to increase as we further advance clinical development  including the planned initiation of a randomized  registration enabling phase b clinical trial of ganetespib in combination with docetaxel in nsclc in the second quarter of and possible additional clinical trials in other cancer types  as well as the conduct of non clinical supporting activities 
elesclomol in as compared to  costs incurred under our elesclomol program decreased by million  principally including decreases of million for personnel related costs  related research supplies  operational overhead and stock compensation  and million for external costs 
these decreases were principally due to non recurring costs incurred in resulting from the suspension of our previous elesclomol program and subsequent restructuring in the first quarter of  offset in part by efforts in support of the restart of clinical development 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a phase clinical trial of elesclomol in combination with paclitaxel in ovarian cancer that is being conducted by the gog and a phase clinical trial of elesclomol as a single agent in aml  with patient enrollment in these studies expected in the first quarter of in  we anticipate that the overall costs under our elesclomol program will increase significantly as we further advance clinical development  including the planned initiation of a randomized phase b clinical trial in nsclc in the second quarter of this trial will include a dose escalation and safety portion to optimize the dose selection for the phase b portion 
we expect the randomized phase b portion to begin by the fourth quarter of in as compared to  costs incurred under our elesclomol program decreased by million  principally including decreases of million for personnel related costs  related research supplies and operational overhead  million for stock compensation  and million for external costs 
on february   we suspended the symmetry trial  our global  pivotal phase clinical trial which was initiated in the third quarter of  as well as the additional ongoing clinical studies using the sodium salt  water soluble formulation of elesclomol  including the phase trial of elesclomol in combination with docetaxel and prednisone in prostate cancer that was initiated in the fourth quarter of and the monotherapy phase trial in solid tumors that was initiated in january subsequently  on march   we committed to a restructuring that consisted primarily of an immediate workforce reduction 
in  stock compensation decreased by million due in part to the workforce reduction in the first quarter of and in part to the non recurring correction recognized in the first quarter of see note in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements 
apilimod in as compared to  costs incurred under our apilimod program decreased by million principally due to decreases of million for personnel related costs  related research supplies  operational overhead and stock compensation  and million for external costs 
based on our review of the results of a phase a clinical trial of apilimod in patients with ra  we do not expect to continue development of apilimod in this indication  with this formulation and route of administration 
in as compared to  costs incurred under our apilimod program principally increased by million due to a million increase for external costs

liquidity funding requirements we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses and capital expenditures and anticipate that our expenses and losses may increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we complete the ongoing and contemplated clinical trials of ganetespib in solid tumors and hematologic cancers and initiate additional clinical trials of ganetespib  including the planned initiation of a phase b clinical trial of ganetespib in combination with docetaxel in nsclc  if supported by trial results  complete preclinical development of an additional hsp inhibitor and initiate clinical trials of this compound  if supported by the preclinical data  complete the ongoing clinical trials of elesclomol in aml and ovarian cancers  and initiate additional clinical trials of elesclomol  including the planned initiation of a phase b clinical trial of elesclomol in nsclc  if supported by trial results  complete preclinical development of sta and initiate clinical trials  if supported by preclinical data  advance our cracm inhibitor compounds not licensed to roche under the roche agreement into preclinical development and initiate clinical trials  if supported by preclinical data  discover  develop  and seek regulatory approval for backups of our current drug candidates and other new drug candidates  identify additional compounds or drug candidates and acquire rights from third parties to those compounds or drug candidates through licenses  acquisitions or other means  and commercialize any approved drug candidates 
our funding requirements will depend on a number of factors  including the progress and results of our ongoing clinical trials of ganetespib and any additional clinical trials of ganetespib we may initiate in the future  including the planned initiation of a phase b clinical trial of ganetespib in combination with docetaxel in nsclc  based on the results of these clinical trials  the results of preclinical studies of any additional hsp inhibitors we may develop  and our decision to initiate clinical trials  if supported by preclinical data  the progress and results of our ongoing clinical trials of elesclomol and any additional clinical trials of elesclomol we may initiate in the future  including the planned initiation of a phase b clinical trial of elesclomol in nsclc  based on the results of these clinical trials  the results of our preclinical studies of sta  and our decision to initiate clinical trials  if supported by the preclinical and other test results  the results of our preclinical studies of our cracm inhibitor compounds not licensed to roche under the roche agreement  and our decision to initiate clinical trials  if supported by the preclinical and other test results  roche ability to satisfy its obligations under the roche agreement  including payment of milestone and royalty payments  uncertainty associated with costs  timing  and outcome of regulatory review of our drug candidates  the scope  progress  results  and cost of preclinical development  clinical trials  and regulatory review of any new drug candidates we may discover or acquire  the costs of preparing  filing  and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining  enforcing  and defending intellectual property related claims  our ability to establish additional strategic collaborations and licensing or other arrangements on terms favorable to us  the costs to satisfy our obligations under potential future collaborations  and the timing  receipt  and amount of sales or royalties  if any  from ganetespib  elesclomol  sta  our cracm inhibitors  our il inhibitors and our other potential products 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  an increase of million from million as of december  this increase principally reflects million in net cash proceeds from financing activities and million in research and development funding from roche  offset by cash used in operations as discussed under cash flows above 
the million in net cash proceeds from financing activities includes million in net proceeds from the sale of  shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering in january  million in gross proceeds from the gecc term loan that was executed in september and million in net proceeds from the direct sale of  shares of our common stock in november  as well as million from the exercise of common stock options 
we do not anticipate that we will generate product revenue in the foreseeable future  if at all 
we expect our continuing operations to use cash over the next several years and such cash use may increase significantly from year to year 
while we are engaged in multiple preliminary partnership discussions for each of our currently unpartnered programs ganetespib  elesclomol  sta  cracm compounds not licensed by roche under the roche agreement  and our il inhibitors which could result in one or more new partnership agreements  that may include upfront payments and cost sharing provisions  there is no guarantee we will be successful in entering into any such partnership agreements on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  or that we will receive any other revenue through these partnership efforts in the future 
based on our current operating levels  we expect our cash resources will be sufficient to fund operations into this estimate assumes that certain activities contemplated for will be conducted subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources 
we are evaluating additional potential sources of funding  including partnership agreements  cost or risk sharing arrangements  equity financings  use of our million equity line of credit facility or other sources 
we may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect in order to conduct additional clinical trials and conduct additional preclinical and discovery activities 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our drug candidates  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  collaboration agreements  debt financings or licensing arrangements 
however  the credit markets and the financial services industry have recently been experiencing a period of turmoil and uncertainty that have made equity and debt financing more difficult to obtain 
additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders 
for example  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or by selling convertible debt securities  further dilution to our existing stockholders may result 
if we raise funds through collaboration agreements or licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish rights to our technologies or drug candidates  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to terminate  significantly modify or delay our research and development programs  reduce our planned commercialization efforts  or obtain funds through collaborators that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or drug candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently 
conversely  we may elect to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable  including through offerings of securities pursuant to our shelf registration statement on form s  under which we currently have up to million in securities available for issuance  including up to million in shares of common stock that we may offer and sell under the eloc with azimuth 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities 
tax loss carryforwards in  and  we performed analyses to determine if there were changes in ownership  as defined by section of the internal revenue code that would limit our ability to utilize certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we determined that we experienced a change in ownership  as defined by section  in connection with the acquisition of principia associates  inc on september   but did not experience a change in ownership upon the effectiveness of our ipo or any other equity offerings to date 
as a result  the utilization of our federal tax net operating loss carryforwards generated prior to the ownership change is limited 
as of december  we have net operating loss carryforwards for us federal tax purposes of approximately million  after taking into consideration net operating losses expected to expire unused as a result of this limitation  and the remainder will expire in varying amounts through unless utilized 
in addition  as of december   we have state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which will expire through unless utilized 
the utilization of these net operating loss carryforwards may be further limited as we experience future ownership changes as defined in section of the internal revenue code

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million consisting of cash deposited in a highly rated financial institution in the united states and in a short term us treasury money market fund  as well as high grade commercial paper and government agency securities that are guaranteed by the us government 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations and we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we believe that we did not have material exposure to high risk investments such as mortgage backed securities  auction rate securities or other special investment vehicles within our money market fund investments 
we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in fair value as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  would reduce future investment income 
capital market risk 
we currently have no product revenues and depend on funds raised through other sources 
one possible source of funding is through further equity offerings 
our ability to raise funds in this manner depends upon capital market forces affecting our stock price
