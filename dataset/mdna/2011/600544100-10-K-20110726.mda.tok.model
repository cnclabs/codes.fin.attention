we are globally positioned in terms of manufacturing operations 
in the united states  our manufacturing operations are located in michigan  georgia  iowa and wisconsin 
in europe  we have a manufacturing presence in the united kingdom  our largest marketplace outside of the united states 
in asia  we have manufacturing operations in ningbo  china 
we manufacture our products using a system of lean manufacturing techniques collectively referred to as the herman miller performance system hmps 
we strive to maintain efficiencies and cost savings by minimizing the amount of inventory on hand 
accordingly  production is order driven with direct materials and components purchased as needed to meet demand 
the standard lead time for the majority of our products is to days 
these factors result in a high rate of inventory turns and typically cause our inventory levels to appear relatively low compared to our sales volume 
a key element of our manufacturing strategy is to limit fixed production costs by sourcing component parts from strategic suppliers 
this strategy has allowed us to increase the variable nature of our cost structure while retaining proprietary control over those production processes that we believe provide us a competitive advantage 
as a result of this strategy  our manufacturing operations are largely assembly based 
our business consists of various operating segments as defined by generally accepted accounting principles 
these operating segments are determined on the basis of how we internally report and evaluate financial information used to make operating decisions and are organized by the various markets we serve 
for external reporting purposes  we aggregate these operating segments as follows 
north american furniture solutions includes the business associated with the design  manufacture  and sale of furniture products for office  learning and healthcare environments throughout the united states and canada 
non north american furniture solutions includes the business associated with the design  manufacture  and sale of furniture products primarily for work related settings for mexico and outside north america 
other includes our north american residential furniture business as well as unallocated corporate expenses  and restructuring costs 
core strengths we rely on the following core strengths in delivering workplace solutions to our customers 
brand our brand is recognized by customers as a pioneer in design and sustainability  and as an advocate that supports their needs and interests 
within our industry  herman miller is acknowledged as one of the leading brands that inspires architects and designers to create their best commercial design solutions 
leveraging our brand equity across our lines of business to extend our reach to customers and consumers is an important element of our business strategy 
problem solving design and innovation we are committed to developing research based functionality and aesthetically innovative new products and have a history of doing so 
we believe our skills and experience in matching problem solving design with the workplace needs of our customers provide us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
an important component of our business strategy is to actively pursue a program of new product research  design  and development 
we accomplish this through the use of an internal research  engineering  and design staff as well as third party design resources generally compensated on a royalty basis 
operational excellence we were among the first in our industry to embrace the concepts of lean manufacturing 
hmps provides the foundation for all of our manufacturing operations 
we are committed to continuously improving both product quality and production and operational efficiency 
we have extended this lean process work to our non manufacturing processes as well as externally to our manufacturing supply chain and distribution channel 
we believe this work holds great promise for further gains in reliability  quality and efficiency 
building and leading networks we value relationships in all areas of our business 
we consider our networks of innovative designers  owned and independent dealers  and suppliers to be among our most important competitive factors and vital to the long term success of our business 
channels of distribution our products and services are offered to most of our customers under standard trade credit terms between and days and are sold through the following distribution channels 
independent contract furniture dealers and licensees most of our product sales are made to a network of independently owned and operated contract furniture dealerships doing business in many countries around the world 
these dealers purchase our products and distribute them to end customers 
we recognize revenue on product sales through this channel once our products are shipped and title passes to the dealer 
many of these dealers also offer furniture related services  including product installation 
owned contract furniture dealers at may   we owned contract furniture dealerships  some of which have operations in multiple locations 
the financial results of these owned dealers are included in our consolidated financial statements 
product sales to these dealerships are eliminated as inter company transactions from our consolidated financial results 
we recognize revenue on these sales once products are shipped to the end customer and installation is substantially complete 
we believe independent ownership of contract furniture dealers is generally the best model for a financially strong distribution network 
with this in mind  our strategy is to continue to pursue opportunities to transition our owned dealerships to independent owners 
where possible  our goal is to involve local managers in these ownership transitions 
subsequent to the end of fiscal we completed the sale of two ontract furniture dealerships 
direct customer sales we sometimes sell products and services directly to end customers without an intermediary eg sales to the us federal government 
in most of these instances  we contract separately with a dealership or third party installation company to provide sales related services 
we recognize revenue on these sales once products are shipped and installation is substantially complete 
independent retailers certain products are sold to end customers through independent retail operations 
revenue is recognized on these sales once products are shipped and title passes to the independent retailer 
e commerce during fiscal the company launched its own internet based sales business  in which products are now available for sale via the company website 
this site complements our existing methods of distribution and exemplifies the company brand to new customers 
the company recognizes revenue on these sales once products are shipped 
challenges ahead like all businesses  we are faced with a host of challenges and risks 
we believe our core strengths and values  which provide the foundation for our strategic direction  have us well prepared to respond to the inevitable challenges we will face in the future 
while we are confident in our direction  we acknowledge the risks specific to our business and industry 
refer to item a for discussion of certain of these risk factors 
future avenues of growth we believe we are well positioned to successfully pursue our mission in spite of the risks and challenges we face 
that is  we will design and develop furniture and related services and technologies that reflect sustainable business practices that improve environments and help to create a better world 
in pursuing our mission  we have identified the following as key avenues for our future growth 
primary markets capture additional market share within our primary markets by offering superior solutions and ever expanding product categories  to customers who value space as a strategic tool 
adjacent markets further apply our core skills in space environments such as healthcare  higher education  and residential 
developing economies expand our geographic reach in areas of the world with significant growth potential 
new markets develop or acquire new products and technologies that serve new markets 
industry analysis the business and institutional furniture manufacturer association bifma is the trade association for the us domestic office furniture industry 
we monitor the trade statistics reported by bifma and consider them an indicator of industry wide sales and order performance 
bifma publishes statistical data for the contract segment and the office supply segment within the us furniture market 
the us contract segment is primarily with large to mid size corporations installed via a network of dealers 
the office supply segment is primarily to smaller customers via wholesalers and retailers 
we primarily participate  and are a leader in  the contract segment 
it is important to note that our diversification strategy lessens our dependence on the us office furniture market 
we also analyze bifma statistical information as a benchmark comparison against the performance of our domestic us business and also to that of our competitors 
the timing of large project based business may affect comparisons to this data in any one period 
finally  bifma regularly provides its members with industry forecast information  which we use internally as one of several considerations in our short and long range planning process 
discussion of business conditions our fiscal years ended may  and may  each included weeks of operations 
fiscal benefited from a more robust global economic environment impacting most areas of our business from a net sales and orders perspective 
net sales and net trade orders rebounded percent and percent  respectively  from the prior year 
operating earnings were percent of sales including the positive impact on operating expense resulting from reducing the estimated liability related to contingent payments associated with the nemschoff acquisition of million  refer to note of the consolidated financial statements 
from an economic perspective  the macro drivers of demand in the contract office furniture industry have strengthened within the year with office moves and low rental rates continuing to drive new orders 
however  this continues to be tempered by fairly stagnant unemployment rates 
we have made great progress this year toward our strategic goals while delivering solid financial results 
we took action to de leverage our balance sheet in the fourth quarter by paying off million of our public bond issue  partially funded by million of newly issued private placement notes 
we also took action to reduce our long term pension commitments during the year by contributing approximately million in the form of cash and stock to the pension plan 
we continued our focus on operational excellence with our manufacturing operations maintaining a reliability score of percent throughout the year and  for the fifth time in six years  we received the office furniture dealers alliance ofda gold award as the manufacturer of the year 
the development of new products has remained a critical element of our business strategy as we worked continue to deliver superior products and services to our dealer network 
during the year we launched the thrive portfolio of ergonomic solutions which includes the technology support products we acquired through the purchase of colebrook bosson saunders in may we also introduced the sayl family of chairs which furthered our leadership position in office seating as well as launched canvas office landscape a collection of work station  desking and storage elements that work in harmony to address multiple space applications  from open plan to private office 
at this year neocon we introduced new products 
among the most significant achievements was a new healthcare overbed table called oasis tm  which won a gold award in the healthcare furniture category and the geiger sotto tm executive chair which won silver in the ergonomic task seating category 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we announced the plans to acquire posh office systems ltd  a hong kong based designer  manufacturer  and distributor of office furniture systems  freestanding furniture  seating  filing and storage with manufacturing in china and distribution in hong kong and china 
with posh we gain immediate access to the chinese market 
as the demand for high quality seating and furniture continues to grow in the region  we anticipate a significant increase in the sales of herman miller products through the posh dealer network 
with an expanded product offering through posh  we can also look beyond china to other markets and customers we are not presently serving 
we anticipate this acquisition to close during late calendar with business conditions seemingly improving  there a growing sense of optimism within the company backed by the innovative spirit of our people and a brand that we believe is second to none in our industry 
our continued investments in product and business development throughout the downturn enhanced both the depth and diversity of our product offering  leaving us well positioned to grow in each of our markets 
looking forward  the general economic outlook for our industry in the us is expected to be positive 
bifma issued its most recent report in may expecting that the growth rate of office furniture orders and shipments in the us for calendar will be percent and percent  respectively 
this forecasted growth is based on an improvement in the us economy  including the assumption that businesses will continue to invest in office furniture in order to boost employee productivity 
the forecast projects both orders and shipments will moderate in calendar financial results the following is a comparison of our annual results of operations and year over year percentage changes for the periods indicated 
dollars in millions fiscal chg from fiscal chg from fiscal net sales cost of sales gross margin operating expenses operating earnings net other expenses earnings before income taxes income tax expense net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest net earnings attributable to controlling interest the following table presents  for the periods indicated  the components of the company consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales

the overall impact of foreign currency changes for the fiscal year was to increase net sales by approximately million 
consolidated net trade orders for fiscal totaled  million compared to  million in fiscal  an increase of percent 
order rates began the year at a steady pace with orders averaging approximately million per week through the first quarter 
the second and third quarter weekly orders rates averaged approximately million and million  respectively  with the third quarter experiencing our typical seasonal slowdown 
the fourth quarter finished the year with average weekly order rates increasing to approximately million 
the overall impact of foreign currency changes for the fiscal year increased net orders by approximately million 
our backlog of unfilled orders at the end of fiscal totaled million  a percent increase from the million backlog at the end of fiscal bifma reported an estimated year over year increase in us office furniture shipments of approximately percent for the twelve month period ended may by comparison  the net sales increase for our domestic us business was approximately percent 
we believe that while comparisons to bifma are important  we continue to pursue a strategy of revenue diversification that makes us less reliant on the drivers that impact bifma 
net sales  orders  and backlog fiscal compared to fiscal for the fiscal year ended may   consolidated net sales declined percent to  million from  million for the fiscal year ended may  this year over year decline was driven by the global economic environment and was experienced across nearly all operating and geographic units 
while the us dollar strengthened against many major currencies during fiscal  it weakened against others  notably the canadian dollar 
the overall impact of foreign currency changes for fiscal year was to increase net sales by approximately million 
consolidated net trade orders for fiscal totaled  million compared to  million in fiscal  a decrease of percent 
order rates began the year at a steady pace with orders averaging between approximately million and million per week through the first two quarters 
these order rates  and other economic inputs  gave a solid signal that the business had hit bottom and was stabilized 
moving into the second half of the fiscal  the third quarter  which historically has the weakest order rate of the year  orders dipped down to an average weekly rate of approximately million per week 
although low  this order rate represented a slight increase in order rates from the prior year 
the fourth quarter order rates averaged approximately million per week  which represented our highest order rate in months 
the overall impact of foreign currency changes for fiscal year was to increase net orders by approximately million 
the backlog of unfilled orders at the end of fiscal totaled million  a percent increase from the million backlog at the end of fiscal bifma reported an estimated year over year decline in us office furniture shipments of approximately percent for the twelve month period ended may by comparison  the net sales decline for our domestic us business was approximately percent 
we believe that while comparisons to bifma are important  we continue to pursue a strategy of revenue diversification that makes us less reliant on the drivers that impact bifma 
discussion of operating segments fiscal compared to fiscal effective as of the second quarter of fiscal  management has modified the company segment reporting in order to better align with changes made in the second quarter to the organizational and management reporting structure 
specifically  the company is now reporting operations in mexico within its non north american furniture solutions operating segment rather than in north american furniture solutions 
prior year results have been revised to reflect this change 
net sales within the north american furniture solutions north america segment were  million in fiscal  a percent increase from fiscal net sales of  million 
we experienced an increase across all sectors of our north american business during fiscal operating earnings for the segment in fiscal were million  or percent of net sales 
this compares to segment earnings of million or percent of net sales in fiscal the increase in operating earnings as a percent of net sales in the current fiscal year is primarily driven by leverage 
net sales from the non north american furniture solutions non north america segment were million in fiscal  a million or a percent increase from fiscal net sales of million 
all regions experienced year over year sales growth 
operating earnings within the non north american segment totaled million for the year or percent of net sales 
this compares to an operating loss of million or a negative percent of net sales in fiscal  an increase of basis points 
the operating loss in fiscal was significantly affected by an independent dealer in australia that went into receivership and resulted in bad debt expense of approximately million 
net sales within the other segment category were million in fiscal an increase of million  or percent  compared to fiscal net sales of million 
the increase in net sales is the result of strong sales by our north american retail business 
it should be noted that while the majority of corporate costs are allocated to the operating segments  certain costs that are generally considered the result of isolated business decisions are not subject to allocation 
these costs include restructuring and asset impairment expenses  which have been allocated entirely to the other category in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal restructuring and asset impairment expenses totaled million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these costs are discussed further in note of the consolidated financial statements 
operating earnings within the other segment category totaled million for the year 
this compares to a loss of million in the prior year 
the significant drivers of operating losses in the prior year were restructuring expenses and a million asset impairment charge related to the convia business 
we estimate changes in foreign exchange rates during the year effectively increased our fiscal net sales within the north american segment by approximately million  driven primarily by the us dollar canadian dollar impact  while the impact on net sales within the non north american segment was approximately million driven primarily by the us dollar australian dollar impact 
it is important to note that period to period changes in currency exchange rates have a directionally similar impact on our international cost structures  which reduces the impact of currency fluctuations on operating earnings 
operating earnings within our north american segment increased an estimated million in fiscal due to currency changes 
the estimated impact on operating earnings of our non north american business segment due to currency changes  was an increase of approximately million 
discussion of operating segments fiscal compared to fiscal net sales within the north american furniture solutions north america segment were  million in fiscal  a million or percent decrease from fiscal net sales of  million 
we experienced a decline throughout our north american business operations in fiscal  except for healthcare which benefited from the acquisition of nemschoff in the first quarter 
nemschoff sales were million during fiscal or percent of net sales 
within this segment  we experienced increased sales from education  government and healthcare customers 
operating earnings for the segment in fiscal were million  or percent of net sales 
this compares to segment earnings of million or percent in fiscal net sales from the non north american furniture solutions non north america segment were million in fiscal  a million  or percent  decrease from fiscal net sales of million 
there were regions that experienced year over year sales growth  including india  china and brazil 
the areas hardest hit during the year were the middle east and north latin america which were down and percent from prior year  respectively 
operating losses within the non north american segment totaled million for the year or a negative percent of net sales in fiscal this compares to operating earnings of million or percent of net sales in fiscal the operating loss in fiscal was significantly affected by an independent dealer in australia that went into receivership and resulted in bad debt expense of approximately million 
net sales within the other segment category were million in fiscal an increase of million  or percent  compared to fiscal net sales of million 
the increase in net sales was the result of strong sales by our north american retail business 
it should be noted that while the majority of corporate costs are allocated to the operating segments  certain costs that are generally considered the result of isolated business decisions are not subject to allocation 
restructuring and asset impairment expenses are some of these costs  and have been allocated entirely to the other category in fiscal and restructuring and asset impairment expenses totaled million in fiscal and million in fiscal and are discussed further in note of the consolidated financial statements 
operating losses within the other segment category totaled million for fiscal year this compares to a loss of million in fiscal the significant driver of operating losses in both years were restructuring expenses  though it should be noted that in the fiscal year there was also a million asset impairment charges related to the convia business that contributed to the operating loss 
the us dollar was up and down against the british pound and the euro during fiscal  and weakened throughout the year against the canadian dollar 
the changes in currency exchange rates from fiscal affected the us dollar value of net sales only in the north american operating segment 
the non north american segment ended fiscal with essentially no impact from currency on year over year net sales 
we estimate these changes effectively increased our fiscal net sales within the north american furniture solutions segment by approximately million  driven entirely by the us dollar canadian dollar impact 
it is important to note that period to period changes in currency exchange rates have a directionally similar impact on our international cost structures 
operating earnings within our non north american segment increased an estimated million in fiscal the estimated impact on operating earnings of our north american business segment due to currency changes  was an increase of approximately million 
gross margin fiscal compared to fiscal our fiscal gross margin as a percentage of sales was percent which is an increase of basis points from the fiscal level 
this modest increase was driven primarily by cost leverage on higher production  which was partially offset by deeper discounting  higher employee benefit and incentive costs  and higher costs of key direct materials  most notably steel and steel components 
deeper discounting reduced net sales relative to prior periods 
this has the effect of increasing the components of the condensed consolidated statement of operations as a percentage of net sales 
direct material costs as a percentage of sales in the current year increased basis points from fiscal this was primarily driven by an increase in the cost of commodities and the increase in discounting  which has the effect of reducing net sales 
direct labor costs were lower by basis points as a percentage of sales  although higher in dollars by million driven by an increase in volume from fiscal levels 
this percentage decrease was driven primarily by improved efficiencies and product mix  which was partially offset by deeper discounting and increased employee incentives and benefit costs 
overhead costs as a percent of net sales were lower by basis points but increased by million driven by higher volumes from fiscal the percentage decrease resulted from increased leverage from higher volumes  which was partially offset by deeper discounting and increased employee incentives and benefit costs 
freight expenses  as a percentage of sales  were modestly higher by basis points compared to fiscal levels 
in dollars these costs were higher by million due to increased volume 
the largest contributing factor to the percentage of sales increase was the increase in fuel costs during the year 
gross margin fiscal compared to fiscal our fiscal gross margin as a percentage of sales was percent which is a increase of basis points from the fiscal level 
lower direct material costs due to a reduction in commodity prices along with reduced compensation and benefits from a reduced work schedule  offset deeper discounting and loss of leverage from lower volume 
details relative to each component of gross margin follow 
direct material costs in fiscal  as a percentage of sales in fiscal year decreased basis points 
compared to fiscal  raw material prices were lower in the first half of the year and then gradually increased throughout the second half 
the overall impact in the fiscal year was positive 
direct labor costs in fiscal were higher by basis points as a percentage of sales  though lower in dollars by million  from fiscal levels 
this percentage increase was driven by higher benefit expenses and deeper discounting though it was partially offset by increased operational efficiencies 
overhead costs in fiscal decreased by million from fiscal  though as a percentage of sales these costs increased basis points 
the percentage increase resulted from lost leverage from lower volume and the impact from deeper discounting in fiscal  though this was partially offset by our ability to realize cost reductions associated with restructuring actions 
freight expenses in fiscal  as a percentage of sales  were modestly higher by basis points compared to fiscal levels 
in dollars these costs were lower by million 
while fuel costs did rise throughout the year  the largest contributing factor to the increase as a percentage of sales was the loss of volume which created more less than full loads 
restructuring fiscal and fiscal during fiscal  we continued to experience some impact from the previous restructuring actions initiated in prior years 
total restructuring expense for the year was million 
the restructuring accrual balances of million and million for fiscal years and  respectively are included in  accrued liabilities within the consolidated balance sheet 
throughout fiscal  we continued to take actions to decrease our cost structure 
in the first quarter we announced a plan to consolidate manufacturing operations by closing the brandrud manufacturing facility in auburn  washington and consolidating it with the acquired nemschoff manufacturing facilities 
we had previously announced the decision to consolidate our integrated metal technologies imt subsidiary in spring lake  michigan with other existing manufacturing facilities 
our operations team worked diligently throughout fiscal to complete both consolidation projects in the fourth quarter 
the total expense of these plant consolidations in the fiscal year totaled approximately million 
we expected to realize incremental annual savings from these consolidation actions of approximately million to million from the fiscal expense levels 
these savings relate primarily in cost of sales  from reductions in rent expense  depreciation and utilities  as well as savings of approximately million in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
we realized approximately million of savings in fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we took further action to reduce our salaried workforce  primarily in north america  with the reduction of approximately employees 
this action resulted in severance and related expenses of approximately million and was largely offset by a percent wage restoration for employees impacted by the fiscal wage reduction action 
included in the fourth quarter of fiscal restructuring expenses is an impairment of long lived assets totaling million that were related to our convia line of business 
these assets related to products that we determined had no future revenue stream to the company 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information on restructuring 
operating expense fiscal compared to fiscal operating expenses in fiscal were million  or percent of net sales  which compares to million  or percent of net sales in fiscal we experienced a year over year increase in operating expense dollars of million  and a basis point decrease to operating expenses as a percentage of net sales 
the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by the increase in net sales during the year 
in addition  we also incurred million and million of additional operating expenses during fiscal due to the reinstatement of all of our employee benefits and employee incentive expenses  respectively 
restructuring expenses were million  compared to restructuring and impairment expenses of million in fiscal  which included an impairment of million for convia assets see the discussion on restructuring expense above for additional detail 
operating expenses were partially offset during fiscal by the positive impact resulting from the settlement of the liability related to contingent payments associated with the nemschoff acquisition of million 
year over year changes in currency exchange rates increased operating expenses by an estimated million associated with our international operations 
design and research costs included in total operating expenses for fiscal was million  or percent of net sales  compared to fiscal expenses of million  or percent of net sales 
this increase in dollars of million resulted in a decrease of basis points as a percent of sales

the operating expenses from nemschoff during fiscal year were million  which were partially offset by the positive impact on operating expense resulting from reducing the estimated liability related to contingent payments associated with the nemschoff acquisition of million 
the year over year dollar decline in total expenses of million was the result of an million decrease in restructuring and impairment expenses and a continued decrease in employee compensation and benefit costs 
these decreases in compensation and benefit costs were a result of a combination of current and prior year restructuring as well as the full year effect of the suspension of the k match and the percent reduction in salary expense that resulted from shutting down facilities on every other friday 
year over year changes in currency exchange rates had a slightly inflationary effect of approximately million on operating expenses associated with our international operations for fiscal design and research costs included in total operating expenses for fiscal was million  or percent of sales  compared to fiscal expenses of million  or percent of sales 
this decrease in dollars of million was an increase of basis points as a percent of sales and was primarily driven by the timing of various projects being brought to market as well as a reduction or delay of projects 
we have continued to carefully balance the overall need to control costs with the critical need to continue investing in our strategic priorities 
these expenses include royalty payments to the designers of our products totaling million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
operating earnings in fiscal operating earnings were million  a percent increase from fiscal operating earnings of million

operating earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal years  and were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
other expenses and income net other expenses totaled million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in fiscal expense compared to fiscal was primarily the result of higher foreign currency transaction losses and lower interest and investment income  which were partially offset by lower interest expense compared to the prior year 
the decrease in fiscal expense compared to fiscal was primarily the result of decreased interest expense associated with the first quarter repurchase of million of outstanding debt securities 
income taxes our effective tax rate was percent in fiscal versus percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal was below the statutory rate of  primarily due to the domestic us manufacturing deduction and realization of foreign tax credits

the effective rate in fiscal was below the statutory rate of percent  primarily due to the domestic us manufacturing tax incentive and the realization of foreign tax credits 
we expect our effective tax rate for fiscal to be between and percent

this change reduced the cash dividend to per share annually versus a total quarterly cash dividend of per share that was paid through the third quarter of fiscal as part of our decision to conserve cash we suspended significant share repurchases beginning in fiscal the amount remaining under our share repurchase authorization at the end of fiscal totaled million 
interest bearing debt at the end of fiscal of million decreased from million at the end of fiscal  as compared to million at the end of fiscal the decrease in fiscal is a result of the repayment of the remaining million in principal due under the public bond issue 
the payment was made using a combination of existing cash and proceeds from newly issued senior unsecured private placement notes of million maturing in march the only usage against our unsecured revolving credit facility at the end of fiscal years and represented outstanding standby letters of credit totaling million and million  respectively 
the provisions of our private placement notes and unsecured credit facility require that we adhere to certain covenants and maintain certain performance ratios 
we were in compliance with all such covenants and performance ratios during fiscal in fiscal  we received million related to the issuance of shares in connection with stock based compensation plans 
this compares to receiving million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
during fiscal we repatriated million of undistributed foreign earnings 
during fiscal we did not repatriate any undistributed foreign earnings as compared to million in fiscal we believe cash on hand  cash generated from operations  and our borrowing capacity will provide adequate liquidity to fund near term and future business operations and capital needs  subject to financing availability in the marketplace 
contingencies the company leases a facility in the uk under an agreement that expired in june  and the company plans to continue to lease the facility on a month to month basis after the lease expires 
under the terms of the lease  the company is required to perform the maintenance and repairs necessary to address the general dilapidation of the facility over the lease term 
the ultimate cost of this provision to the company is dependent on a number of factors including  but not limited to  the future use of the facility by the lessor and whether the company chooses and is permitted to renew the lease term 
the company has estimated the cost of these maintenance and repairs to be between and million  depending on the outcome of future plans and negotiations 
based on existing circumstances  it is estimated that these costs will be approximately million 
as a result  this amount has been recorded as a liability reflected under the caption other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of may  based on circumstances existing in fiscal  the amount recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as of may  was million 
the company has a lease obligation in the uk until may for a facility that it has exited 
current market rates for comparable office space are lower than the rental payments owed under the lease agreement  as such  the company would remain liable to pay the difference if it were subleased 
as of may  and may  the future cost of this arrangement was estimated to be million and million  respectively 
accordingly this amount is reflected within other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of these dates 
the company is involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
it is the company opinion that the outcome of such proceedings and litigation currently pending will not materially affect the company operations  cash flows  and financial condition

contractual obligations contractual obligations associated with our ongoing business and financing activities will result in cash payments in future periods 
the following table summarizes the amounts and estimated timing of these future cash payments

purchase obligations consist of non cancelable purchase orders and commitments for goods  services  and capital assets 
pension plan funding commitments are known for a month period for those plans that are funded  unfunded pension and post retirement plan funding amounts are equal to the estimated benefit payments 
as of may   the total projected benefit obligation for our domestic and international employee pension benefit plans was million 
represents the recorded dividend payable as of may  future dividend payments are not considered contractual obligations until declared 
other contractual obligations primarily represent long term commitments related to deferred and supplemental employee compensation benefits  and other post employment benefits 
off balance sheet arrangements guarantees we provide certain guarantees to third parties under various arrangements in the form of product warranties  loan guarantees  standby letters of credit  lease guarantees  performance bonds  and indemnification provisions 
these arrangements are accounted for and disclosed in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic  guarantees as described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our goal is to report financial results clearly and understandably 
we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in preparing our consolidated financial statements  which require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations 
we continually review our accounting policies and financial information disclosures 
these policies and disclosures are reviewed at least annually with the audit committee of the board of directors 
following is a summary of our more significant accounting policies that require the use of estimates and judgments in preparing the financial statements 
revenue recognition as described in the executive overview  the majority of our products and services are sold through one of four channels independent contract furniture dealers and licensees  owned contract furniture dealers  direct to end customers  and independent retailers 
we recognize revenue on sales to independent dealers  licensees  and retailers once the product is shipped and title passes to the buyer 
when we sell product directly to the end customer or through owned dealers  we recognize revenue once the product and services are delivered and installation thereof is substantially complete 
amounts recorded as net sales generally include any freight charged to customers  with the related freight expenses recognized within cost of sales 
items such as discounts off list price  rebates  and other sale related marketing program expenses are recorded as reductions to net sales 
we record accruals for rebates and other marketing programs  which require us to make estimates about future customer buying patterns and market conditions 
customer sales that reach or fail to reach certain levels can affect the amount of such estimates  and actual results could differ from our estimates receivable allowances we base our allowances for receivables on known customer exposures  historical credit experience  and the specific identification of other potential problems  including the current economic climate 
these methods are applied to all major receivables  including trade  lease  and notes receivable 
in addition  we follow a policy that consistently applies reserve rates based on the age of outstanding accounts receivable 
actual collections can differ from our historical experience  and if economic or business conditions deteriorate significantly  adjustments to these reserves may be required 
the accounts receivable allowance totaled million and million at may  and may   respectively 
as a percentage of gross accounts receivable  these allowances totaled percent and percent for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the year over year decrease in the allowance percentage is primarily due to the stabilization of economic conditions and continued financial health of our customers 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of may  and may   were million and million  respectively 
the company is required to perform an annual test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets to determine if the asset values are impaired 
the impairment testing model is based on the present value of projected cash flows and the resulting residual value and includes a reconciliation to market capitalization 
in completing the test under this approach  the company assumes that one of the drivers of the value of a business today is the cash flows it will generate in the future 
the company also assumes that such future cash flows can be reasonably estimated 
while these projected cash flows reflect the best estimate of future reporting unit performance  actual cash flows could differ significantly 
the company completed the required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of fiscal and concluded that the goodwill asset values and indefinite lived assets were not impaired 
for goodwill  the company employed a market based approach in selecting the discount rates used in our analysis 
the discount rates selected represent market rates of return equal to what the company believes is what a reasonable investor would expect to achieve on investments of similar size to the company reporting units 
the company believes the discount rates selected in the testing are appropriate in that  in all cases  they exceed the estimated weighted average cost of capital for our business as a whole 
the results of the impairment test are sensitive to changes in discount rates  though the testing performed in fiscal indicates that even a significant increase in the discount rate would not have changed the conclusion 
for indefinite lived assets a relief of royalty method was utilized  which indicated the assets were not impaired 
long lived assets the company evaluates other long lived assets and acquired business units for indicators of impairment when events or circumstances indicate that an impairment risk may be present 
the judgments regarding the existence of impairment are based on market conditions  operational performance  and estimated future cash flows 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded to adjust the asset to its estimated fair value 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company recorded an impairment charge of million that was related to our convia line of business 
these assets related to products that we determined had no future revenue stream to the company 
the impairment charge was comprised of million of expense related to an intangible asset and million of expense in relation to fixed assets  respectively 
warranty reserve the company stands behind company products and the promises it makes to customers 
from time to time  quality issues arise resulting in the need to incur costs to correct problems with products or services 
the company has established warranty reserves for the various costs associated with these obligations 
general warranty reserves are based on historical claims experience and periodically adjusted for business levels 
specific reserves are established once an issue is identified 
the valuation of such reserves is based on the estimated costs to correct the problem 
actual costs may vary and may result in an adjustment to these reserves 
inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the inventories at the majority of our manufacturing operations are valued using the last in  first out lifo method  whereas inventories of certain other subsidiaries are valued using the first in  first out fifo method 
the company establishes reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  based on prevailing circumstances and judgment for consideration of current events  such as economic conditions  that may affect inventory 
the reserve required to record inventory at lower of cost or market may be adjusted in response to changing conditions 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities  and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company uncertain tax positions 
the company has net operating loss nol carryforwards available in certain jurisdictions to reduce future taxable income 
the company also has foreign tax credits available in certain jurisdictions to reduce future tax due 
future tax benefits for nol carryforwards and foreign tax credits are recognized to the extent that realization of these benefits is considered more likely than not 
this determination is based on the expectation that related operations will be sufficiently profitable or various tax planning strategies available to us will enable us to utilize the nol carryforwards and or foreign tax credits 
when information becomes available that raises doubts about the realization of a deferred income tax asset  a valuation allowance is established 
self insurance reserves with the assistance of independent actuaries  reserves are established for workers compensation and general liability exposures 
the reserves are established based on expected future claims for incurred losses 
the company also establishes reserves for health  prescription drugs  and dental benefit exposures based on historical claims information along with certain assumptions about future trends 
the methods and assumptions used to determine the liabilities are applied consistently  although actual claims experience can vary 
the company also maintains insurance coverage for certain risk exposures through traditional premium based insurance policies 
the company health benefits retention level does not include an aggregate stop loss policy 
the company retention levels designated within significant insurance arrangements as of may   are as follows 
retention level general liability and auto liability physical damage million per occurrence workers compensation and property million per occurrence health benefits million per employee pension and other post retirement benefits the determination of the obligation and expense for pension and other post retirement benefits depends on certain actuarial assumptions 
among the most significant of these assumptions are the discount rate  interest crediting rate  and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
we determine these assumptions as follows 
discount rate this assumption is established at the end of the fiscal year based on high quality corporate bond yields 
the company utilizes the services of an independent actuarial firm to assist in determining the rate 
for the domestic pension and other post retirement benefit plans  the actuary uses a cash flow matching technique  which compares the estimated future cash flows of the plan to a published discount curve showing the relationship between interest rates and duration for hypothetical zero coupon fixed income investments 
the discount rate is set for the international pension plan based on the yield level of a commonly used corporate bond index in that jurisdiction 
because the average duration of the bonds underlying this index is less than that of our international pension plan liabilities  the index yield is used as a reference point 
the final discount rate takes into consideration the index yield and the difference in comparative durations 
interest crediting rate the company uses this assumption in accounting for our primary domestic pension plan  which is a cash balance type plan 
the rate  which represents the annual rate of interest applied to each plan participant account balance  is established at an assumed level  or spread  below the discount rate 
the company bases this methodology on the historical spread between the year us treasury and high quality corporate bond yields 
this relationship is examined annually to determine whether the methodology is still appropriate 
expected long term rate of return the company bases this assumption on our long term assumed rates of return for equities and fixed income securities  weighted by the allocation of the invested assets of the pension plan 
the company considers likely returns and risk factors specific to the various classes of investments and advice from independent actuaries in establishing this rate 
changes in the investment allocation of plan assets would impact this assumption 
a shift to a higher relative percentage of fixed income securities  for example  would result in a lower assumed rate 
while this assumption represents the long term market return expectation  actual asset returns can and do differ from year to year 
such differences give rise to actuarial gains and losses 
in years where actual market returns are lower than the assumed rate  an actuarial loss is generated 
conversely  an actuarial gain results when actual market returns exceed the assumed rate in a given year 
as of may   and may   the net actuarial loss associated with the employee pension and post retirement benefit plans totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
the majority of this unrecognized loss was associated with lower than expected return on assets for fiscal and fiscal changes in the discount rate and return on assets can have a significant effect on the expense or obligations related to our pension plans 
the company cannot accurately predict these changes in discount rates or investment returns and  therefore  cannot reasonably estimate whether adjustments to the expense or obligation in subsequent years will be significant 
both the may  pension funded status and expense are affected by year end discount rate and expected return on assets assumptions 
any change to these assumptions will be specific to the time periods noted and may not be additive  so the impact of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities shown 
the effect of the indicated increase decrease in discount rates and expected return on assets is shown below in millions assumption percent change expense may  obligation us international us international discount rate expected return on assets for purposes of determining annual net pension expense  the company uses a calculated method for determining the market related value of plan assets 
under this method  the company recognizes the change in fair value of plan assets systematically over a five year period 
accordingly  a portion of the net actuarial loss is deferred 
the remaining portion of the net actuarial loss is subject to amortization expense each year 
the amortization period used in determining this expense is the estimated remaining working life of active pension plan participants 
the company currently estimates this period to be approximately years 
as of may   the deferred net actuarial loss ie the portion of the total net actuarial loss not subject to amortization was approximately million 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions used for employee benefit plans 
stock based compensation the company views stock based compensation as a key component of total compensation for certain employees  non employee directors and officers 
the stock based compensation programs include grants of restricted stock  restricted stock units  performance share units  employee stock purchases  and stock options 
the company recognizes expense related to each of these share based arrangements 
the black scholes option pricing model is used in estimating the fair value of stock options issued in connection with compensation programs 
this pricing model requires the use of several input assumptions 
among the most significant of these assumptions are the expected volatility of the common stock price  and the expected timing of future stock option exercises 
expected volatility this represents a measure  expressed as a percentage  of the expected fluctuation in the market price of the company common stock 
as a point of reference  a high volatility percentage would assume a wider expected range of market returns for a particular security 
all other assumptions held constant  this would yield a higher stock option valuation than a calculation using a lower measure of volatility 
in measuring the fair value of stock options issued during fiscal year  we utilized an expected volatility of percent 
expected term of options this assumption represents the expected length of time between the grant date of a stock option and the date at which it is exercised option life 
the company assumed an average expected term of years in calculating the fair values of the majority of stock options issued during fiscal refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our stock based compensation plans 
contingencies in the ordinary course of business  the company encounters matters that raise the potential for contingent liabilities 
in evaluating these matters for accounting treatment and disclosure  the company is required to apply judgment in order to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred 
the company is also required to measure  if possible  the dollar value of such liabilities in determining whether or not recognition in our financial statements is required 
this process involves the use of estimates which may differ from actual outcomes 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for more information relating to contingencies 
new accounting standards refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for information related to new accounting standards 
forward looking statements certain statements in this filing are not historical facts but are forward looking statements as defined under section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act  as amended 
such statements are based on management belief  assumptions  current expectations  estimates and projections about the office furniture industry  the economy and the company itself 
words like anticipates  believes  confident  estimates  expects  forecast  likely  plans  projects  and should  and variations of such words and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
these statements do not guarantee future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties  and assumptions that are difficult to predict with regard to timing  expense  likelihood  and degree of occurrence 
these risks include  without limitation  employment and general economic conditions in the us and in our international markets  the increase in white collar employment  the willingness of customers to undertake capital expenditures  the types of products purchased by customers  the possibility of order cancellations or deferrals by customers  competitive pricing pressures  the availability and pricing of direct materials  our reliance on a limited number of suppliers  currency fluctuations  the ability to increase prices to absorb the additional costs of direct materials  the financial strength of our dealers  the financial strength of our customers  the mix of our products purchased by customers  our ability to attract and retain key executives and other qualified employees  our ability to continue to make product innovations  the strength of the intellectual property relating to our products  the success of newly introduced products  our ability to serve all of our markets  possible acquisitions  divestitures or alliances  the outcome of pending litigation or governmental audits or investigations  and other risks identified in this form k and our other filings with the securities and exchange commission

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company manufactures  markets  and sells its products throughout the world and  as a result  is subject to changing economic conditions  which could reduce the demand for its products 
direct material costs the company is exposed to risks arising from price changes for certain direct materials and assembly components used in its operations 
the largest such costs incurred by the company are for steel  plastics  textiles  wood particleboard  and aluminum components 
commodity prices steadily increased during the first three quarters and moderated during the fourth quarter of fiscal the net impact of price changes during fiscal was an increase to our costs of approximately million during fiscal the net impact of price changes during fiscal was an decrease to our costs of million to million over fiscal commodity prices were volatile during fiscal  resulting in sharp increases in costs for the first half of the year 
as the year progressed  prices receded back to approximately the same level that they began the year at 
the net impact of price changes during fiscal was an increase to our costs of million to million 
the company believes market prices for commodities in the near term may move higher and acknowledges that over time increases on its key direct materials and assembly components are likely 
consequently  it views the prospect of such increases as an outlook risk to the business 
foreign exchange risk the company primarily manufactures its products in the united states  united kingdom  and china 
it also sources completed products and product components from outside the united states 
the company completed products are sold in numerous countries around the world 
sales in foreign countries as well as certain expenses related to those sales are transacted in currencies other than the company reporting currency  the us dollar 
accordingly  production costs and profit margins related to these sales are affected by the currency exchange relationship between the countries where the sales take place and the countries where the products are sourced or manufactured 
these currency exchange relationships can also affect the company competitive positions within these markets 
in the normal course of business  the company enters into contracts denominated in foreign currencies 
the principal foreign currencies in which the company conducts its business are the british pound sterling  euro  canadian dollar  japanese yen  mexican peso  and chinese renminbi 
as of may   the company had outstanding  sixteen forward currency instruments designed to offset either net asset or net liability exposure that is denominated in non functional currencies 
two forward contracts were placed to offset a million euro denominated net asset exposure and five forward contracts were placed to offset a million us dollar denominated net asset exposure 
one forward contract was placed to offset million australian dollar denominated net asset exposure 
eight forward contracts were placed to offset a million usdollar denominated net liability exposure 
as of may   the company had outstanding  nine forward currency instruments designed to offset either net asset or net liability exposure that is denominated in non functional currencies 
one forward contract was placed in order to offset a million euro denominated net asset exposure and three forward contracts were placed in order to offset a million us dollar denominated net asset exposure 
four forward contracts were placed to offset a million us dollar denominated net liability exposure and one forward contract was placed to offset a million british pound sterling denominated net liability exposure 
the fair value of the forward currency instruments at may  was million and million within current assets and current liabilities  respectively 
at may  the fair value of the forward currency instruments was a negligible amount 
for fiscal year  a net loss of million related to remeasuring all foreign currency transactions into the appropriate functional currency was included in net earnings 
for fiscal year  a net gain of million impacted net earnings 
for fiscal year  a net loss of million impacted net earnings 
additionally  the cumulative effect of translating the balance sheet and income statement accounts from the functional currency into the united states dollar decreased the accumulated comprehensive loss component of total stockholders equity by million as of the end of fiscal conversely  the effect increased the accumulated comprehensive loss component of total stockholders equity by million and million as of the end of fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
interest rate risk the company maintains fixed rate debt for which changes in interest rates generally affect fair market value but not earnings or cash flows 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company interest rate swap agreement expired as planned on march  as of the end of fiscal years and the company held one interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted million of fixed rate debt securities to a variable rate 
the combined fair market value and net asset amount of the effective interest rate swap instruments was million at may  the swap arrangement effectively reduced interest expense by million  million  and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
all cash flows related to the company interest rate swap instruments are denominated in us dollars 
for further information  refer to notes and of the consolidated financial statements 
expected cash flows notional amounts over the next five years and thereafter related to debt instruments are as follows 
in millions thereafter total long term debt fixed rate wtd
