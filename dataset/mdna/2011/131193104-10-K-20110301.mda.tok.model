critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations  financial condition and liquidity are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  shareholders equity  sales and expenses  as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an ongoing basis  the company reviews its estimates to ensure that the estimates appropriately reflect changes in its business and new information as it becomes available 
management believes the critical accounting policies discussed below affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
for a complete discussion of all of the company s significant accounting policies  see note significant accounting policies to the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
revenue recognition sales are recognized in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic  revenue recognition  as products are shipped to customers  net of an allowance for sales returns and accruals for sales programs 
the company records a reserve for anticipated returns through a reduction of sales and cost of sales in the period that the related sales are recorded 
sales returns are estimated based upon historical returns  current economic trends  changes in customer demands and sell through of products 
in addition  from time to time  the company offers sales programs that allow for specific returns 
the company records a reserve for anticipated returns related to these sales programs based on the terms of the sales program as well as historical returns  current economic trends  changes in customer demands and sell through of products 
historically  the company s actual sales returns have not been materially different from management s original estimates 
the company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the allowance for sales returns 
however  if the actual costs of sales returns are significantly different than the recorded estimated allowance  the company may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
assuming there had been a increase in the company s sales returns  pre tax loss for the year ended december  would have been increased by approximately million 
the company also records estimated reductions to revenue for sales programs such as incentive offerings 
sales program accruals are estimated based upon the attributes of the sales program  management s forecast of future product demand  and historical customer participation in similar programs 
the company s primary sales program  the preferred retailer program  offers longer payment terms during the initial sell in period  as well as potential rebates and discounts  for participating retailers in exchange for providing certain benefits to the company  including the maintenance of agreed upon inventory levels  prime product placement and retailer staff training 
under this program  qualifying retailers can earn either discounts or rebates based upon the amount of product purchased 
discounts are applied and recorded at the time of sale 
for rebates  the company accrues an estimate of the rebate at the time of sale based on the customer s estimated qualifying current year product purchases 
the estimate is based on the historical level of purchases  adjusted for any factors expected to affect the current year purchase levels 
the estimated year end rebate is adjusted quarterly based on actual purchase levels  as necessary 
the preferred retailer program is generally short term in nature and the actual costs of the program are known as of the end of the year and paid to customers shortly after year end 
in addition to the 
table of contents preferred retailer program  the company from time to time offers additional sales program incentive offerings which are also generally short term in nature 
historically the company s actual costs related to its preferred retailer program and other sales programs have not been materially different than its estimates 
revenues from gift cards are deferred and recognized when the cards are redeemed 
in addition  the company recognizes revenue from unredeemed gift cards when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote and under circumstances that comply with any applicable state escheatment laws 
the company s gift cards have no expiration 
to determine when redemption is remote  the company analyzes an aging of unredeemed cards based on the date the card was last used or the activation date if the card has never been used and compares that information with historical redemption trends 
the company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to determine the timing of recognition of gift card revenues 
however  if the company is not able to accurately determine when gift card redemption is remote  the company may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
the deferred revenue associated with outstanding gift cards decreased from million at december  to million during the year ended december  revenues from course credits in connection with the use of the company s upro gps on course range finders are deferred when purchased and recognized when customers download the course credits for usage 
deferred revenue associated with unused course credits increased to million at december  from million at december  allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments 
an estimate of uncollectible amounts is made by management based upon historical bad debts  current customer receivable balances  age of customer receivable balances  the customer s financial condition and current economic trends  all of which are subject to change 
if the actual uncollected amounts significantly exceed the estimated allowance  the company s operating results would be significantly adversely affected 
assuming there had been a increase in the company s allowance for doubtful accounts  pre tax loss for the year ended december  would have been increased by approximately million 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or fair market value 
cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
the inventory balance  which includes material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs  is recorded net of an estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory 
the estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory is based upon current inventory levels  sales trends and historical experience as well as management s understanding of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand  all of which are subject to change 
the calculation of the company s allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging  forecasted consumer demand and pricing  regulatory usga and r a rule changes  the promotional environment and technological obsolescence 
the company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the allowance 
however  if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner  the company may need to increase its inventory allowance  which could significantly adversely affect the company s operating results 
assuming there had been a increase in the company s allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory  pre tax loss for the year ended december  would have been increased by approximately million 

table of contents long lived assets in the normal course of business  the company acquires tangible and intangible assets 
the company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of its long lived assets including property  plant and equipment  investments  goodwill and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable or exceeds its fair value 
determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions  including determining the amount of undiscounted cash flows directly related to the potentially impaired asset  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  the timing of the impairment test  and the asset s residual value  if any 
to determine fair value  the company uses its internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate rate  quoted market prices  royalty rates when available and independent appraisals as appropriate 
any required impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the asset and a charge to earnings 
the company uses its best judgment based on current facts and circumstances related to its business when making these estimates 
the company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate long lived asset impairment losses 
however  if actual results are not consistent with the company s estimates and assumptions used in calculating future cash flows and asset fair values  the company may be exposed to losses that could be material 
during the fourth quarter of  the company conducted its annual impairment test on its goodwill and intangible assets  including the trade names  trademarks and other intangible assets the company acquired in as part of the acquisition of the assets of tfgc estate  inc f k a the top flite golf company 
in completing the impairment analysis  the company determined that the discounted expected cash flows from the trade names and trademarks associated with the acquisition was million less than the carrying value of those assets 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of for further discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements goodwill and intangible assets in this form k 
warranty policy the company has a stated two year warranty policy for its golf clubs 
the company s policy is to accrue the estimated cost of satisfying future warranty claims at the time the sale is recorded 
in estimating its future warranty obligations  the company considers various relevant factors  including the company s stated warranty policies and practices  the historical frequency of claims  and the cost to replace or repair its products under warranty 
the company s estimates for calculating the warranty reserve are principally based on assumptions regarding the warranty costs of each club product line over the expected warranty period  where little or no claims experience may exist 
experience has shown that warranty rates can vary between product models 
therefore  the company s warranty obligation calculation is based upon long term historical warranty rates until sufficient data is available 
as actual model specific rates become available  the company s estimates are modified to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes 
historically  the company s actual warranty claims have not been materially different from management s original estimated warranty obligation 
the company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the warranty obligation 
however  if the number of actual warranty claims or the cost of satisfying warranty claims significantly exceeds the estimated warranty reserve  the company may be exposed to losses that could be material 
assuming there had been a increase in the company s warranty obligation  pre tax loss for the year ended december  would have been increased by approximately million 

table of contents income taxes current income tax expense or benefit is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or receivable for the current year 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability computed pursuant to asc topic  income taxes  and its reported amount in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled  respectively 
the company provides a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be a charge to income in the period such determination was made 
pursuant to asc topic  the company is required to accrue for the estimated additional amount of taxes for uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that the company would be required to pay such additional taxes 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than likelihood of being sustained 
the company is required to file federal and state income tax returns in the united states and various other income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions 
the preparation of these income tax returns requires the company to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions  which could affect the amount of tax paid by the company 
as required under applicable accounting rules  the company accrues an amount for its estimate of additional tax liability  including interest and penalties  for any uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return 
the company reviews and updates the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes available 
historically  additional taxes paid as a result of the resolution of the company s uncertain tax positions have not been materially different from the company s expectations 
information regarding income taxes is contained in note income taxes to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation the company accounts for share based compensation arrangements in accordance with asc topic  stock compensation  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
asc topic further requires a reduction in share based compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate 
the forfeiture rate used by the company is based on historical forfeiture trends 
if actual forfeitures are not consistent with the company s estimates  the company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expenses in future periods 
the company uses the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of its stock options at the date of grant 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the company s expected stock price volatility  the expected dividend yield  the expected life of an option and the risk free rate  which is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option 
the company uses historical data to estimate the expected price volatility and the expected option life 
the company uses forecasted dividends to estimate the expected dividend yield 
the company believes a forecasted calculation is more appropriate than using historical data since the amount of dividends paid have decreased beginning in changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option 
furthermore  the estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by an employee 
compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 

table of contents the company records compensation expense for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units collectively restricted stock based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant 
the estimated fair value is determined based on the closing price of the company s common stock on the award date multiplied by the number of shares underlying the restricted stock awarded 
compensation expense related to unvested shares is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period  reduced by an estimated forfeiture rate 
phantom stock units are a form of share based awards that are indexed to the company s stock and are settled in cash 
they are accounted for as a liability  which are initially measured based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant 
the estimated fair value is determined based on the closing price of the company s common stock on the date of grant multiplied by the number of shares underlying phantom stock 
the liability is subsequently remeasured based on the fair value of the awards at the end of each interim reporting period through the settlement date of the awards 
total compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period

 the estimated aggregate cost of the acquired assets was million  which includes cash paid of million  transaction costs of approximately million  and assumed liabilities of approximately million 
the aggregate acquisition costs exceeded the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired 
as a result  the company has recorded goodwill of million  none of which is deductible for tax purposes 
the company has recorded the fair values of uplay s database and technology  trademarks and trade names  and non compete agreements in the amounts of million  million and million  respectively  using an income valuation approach 
this valuation technique provides an estimate of the fair value of an asset based on the cash flows that the asset can be expected to generate over its remaining useful life 
these intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which range from to years 

table of contents in connection with this purchase  the company could be required to pay an additional purchase price not to exceed million based on a percentage of earnings generated from the sale of uplay products over a period of three years ending on december  any such additional purchase price paid at the end of the three year period will be recorded as goodwill

results of operations overview of business and seasonality the company designs  manufactures and sells high quality golf clubs and golf balls and also sells golf and lifestyle apparel  golf footwear  golf bags  gloves  eyewear and other golf related accessories  including upro gps on course measurement devices 
the company designs its products to be technologically advanced and in this regard invests a considerable amount in research and development each year 
the company s golf products are designed for golfers of all skill levels  both amateur and professional 
the company has two operating segments that are organized on the basis of products  namely the golf clubs segment and golf balls segment 
the golf clubs segment consists primarily of callaway golf  top flite and ben hogan woods  hybrids  irons  wedges and putters as well as odyssey putters 
this segment also includes other golf related accessories described above and royalties from licensing of the company s trademarks and service marks as well as sales of pre owned golf clubs 
the golf balls segment consists primarily of callaway golf and top flite golf balls 
as discussed in note segment information to the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company s operating segments exclude a significant amount of corporate general administrative expenses and other income expense not utilized by management in determining segment profitability 
in most of the regions where the company does business  the game of golf is played primarily on a seasonal basis 
weather conditions generally restrict golf from being played year round  except in a few markets  with many of the company s on course customers closing for the cold weather months 
the company s business is therefore also subject to seasonal fluctuations 
in general  during the first quarter  the company begins selling its products into the golf retail channel for the new golf season 
this initial sell in generally continues into the second quarter 
the company s second quarter sales are also significantly affected by the amount of reorder business of the products sold during the first quarter 
the company s third quarter sales are generally dependent on reorder business but are generally less than the second quarter as many retailers begin decreasing their inventory levels in anticipation of the end of the golf season 
the company s fourth quarter sales are generally less than the other quarters due to the end of the golf season in many of the company s key markets 
however  
table of contents fourth quarter sales can be affected from time to time by the early launch of product introductions related to the new golf season of the subsequent year 
this seasonality  and therefore quarter to quarter fluctuations  can be affected by many factors  including the timing of new product introductions 
in general  however  because of this seasonality  a majority of the company s sales and most  if not all  of its profitability generally occurs during the first half of the year 
approximately half of the company s business is conducted outside of the united states and is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  changes in foreign currency rates can have a significant effect on the company s financial results 
the company enters into foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency rates 
while these foreign currency exchange contracts can mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency rates  they do not eliminate those effects  which can be significant 
these effects include i the translation of results denominated in foreign currency into us dollars for reporting purposes  ii the mark to market adjustments of certain intercompany balance sheet accounts denominated in foreign currencies  and iii the mark to market adjustments on the company s foreign currency exchange contracts 
in general  the company s overall financial results are affected positively by a weaker us dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger us dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which the company conducts its business 
as a result of the overall weakening of the us dollar during compared to  the translation of foreign currency exchange rates had a net positive impact on the company s financial results during executive summary when the recent economic crisis hit the golf industry in mid  the company made the decision to weather the crisis with a balanced approach between managing costs and continuing to invest in initiatives that would benefit its business once the economic crisis subsided and the golf industry recovered 
during  the overall golf industry did not recover as management had anticipated 
in  the golf industry declined in the united states by approximately compared to  which declined by approximately compared to the company believes that there were similar declines in the golf industry internationally 
during this period  consistent with its balanced approach strategy  the company managed its costs but also invested in i new and emerging markets such as china  india and other countries in southeast asia  ii new technology  including its new forged composite technology and its upro business  iii its growing accessories and apparel business  and iv in its global operations strategy initiatives targeted at improving gross margins  including the reorganization of its golf club and golf ball manufacturing and distribution operations 
although the company s overall financial results were significantly affected by this industry decline and by these investments  as well as by some non operational charges  the company is encouraged by signs of improving general economic and market conditions and by improvements in the company s underlying operational performance as a result of these investments 
despite the overall decline in the golf industry  the company s net sales in increased compared to  primarily as a result of favorable foreign currency rates  an overall increase in average selling prices  and increased sales in the company s accessories and apparel businesses and new and emerging markets 
these improvements offset a decline in sales in the united states and europe  which continued to be adversely affected by constrained consumer spending on discretionary durable products  particularly during the height of the golf season 
the company s gross profit as a percentage of net sales for improved by percentage points to  compared to for  despite absorbing an incremental million in charges in related to the implementation of the company s global operations strategy 
this percentage points increase is primarily the result of net favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates  benefits derived from the company s prior global operations strategy initiatives  and less promotional activity on in line products in compared to during  the company s operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to from in operating expenses in include a million non cash impairment charge related to certain intangible assets acquired in as part of the top flite acquisition 
the operating expenses in also reflect increased costs related to the investments described above and the adverse net effect of changes in foreign currency rates 

table of contents while the company s overall net operating results discussed above benefited during from changes in foreign currency rates related to the translation of the company s international results into us dollars for reporting purposes  these benefits were partially offset by the effect that foreign currency exchange rates had on the company s other income expense for as a result of the net effect the relatively weak us dollar had on the mark to market adjustments on the company s accounts payable and accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies and foreign currency exchange contracts  the company s other income expense was adversely affected by million in compared to million in the company s net loss increased by million to million in compared to million in and loss per share increased to in compared to in compared to  the net loss and loss per share for was adversely affected by i the million per share non cash impairment charge for the top flite intangible assets  ii an incremental million per share of charges related to the company s global operations strategy initiatives  and iii by an million increase in other expense  primarily resulting from foreign currency exchange rates as discussed above 
in addition  as compared to  the company s loss per share was adversely affected by an incremental per share as a result of the company s june preferred stock offering  which only affected results for approximately six months 
while the company s financial performance in will ultimately depend on the degree to which consumers return to purchasing golf equipment in general  and the company s new products in particular  the company is encouraged by some positive early indicators 
economic and market conditions appear generally to be improving  the price discounting that was pervasive in appears to have lessened in  the company s retail inventory levels are at reasonable levels  and the company received more gold medals than any other manufacturer in golf digest s product review 
the company also expects to realize in additional benefits from its investments in its new and emerging markets  technology  accessories and apparel businesses and global operations strategy 
as a result  the company expects that in its underlying operational performance and financial results will continue to improve compared to years ended december  and net sales in increased by million to million compared to million in global economic conditions continued to be challenging during the current year and the golf industry overall did not recover in as the company s management had anticipated at the beginning of the year 
although the unfavorable economic and industry conditions significantly affected sales volumes in  favorable foreign currency rates and an overall increase in average selling prices  as a result of less promotional activity  were able to offset the volume decline 
net sales were favorably impacted by million due to changes in foreign currency rates used to translate sales in foreign currencies into us dollars 
this increase in net sales consists of a million increase in net sales of the company s golf clubs segment partially offset by a million decrease in net sales of the company s golf balls segment as presented below dollars in millions years ended december  growth decline dollars percent net sales golf clubs golf balls certain prior period costs associated with gift card promotions have been reclassified from accessories and other into the applicable product categories to conform with the current year presentation

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company uses derivative financial instruments for hedging purposes to limit its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
transactions involving these financial instruments are with creditworthy banks  including the banks that are parties to the company s line of credit see note financing arrangements to the notes of the consolidated financial statements 
the use of these instruments exposes the company to market and credit risk which may at times be concentrated with certain counterparties  although counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated 
the company is also exposed to interest rate risk from its line of credit 
foreign currency fluctuations in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to transactions of its international subsidiaries  including certain balance sheet exposures payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies see note derivatives and hedging to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the company is exposed to gains and losses resulting from the translation of the operating results of the company s international subsidiaries into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
as part of its strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  the company uses derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward contracts and put and call option contracts foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge transactions that are denominated primarily in british pounds  euros  japanese yen  canadian dollars  australian dollars and korean won 
for most currencies  the company is a net receiver of foreign currencies and  therefore  benefits from a weaker us dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which the company transacts significant amounts of business 
foreign currency exchange contracts are used only to meet the company s objectives of offsetting gains and losses from foreign currency exchange exposures with gains and losses from the contracts used to hedge them in order to reduce volatility of earnings 
the extent to which the company s hedging activities mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates varies based upon many factors  including the amount of transactions being hedged

at december  and  there were no outstanding foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for anticipated sales denominated in foreign currencies 
as part of the company s risk management procedure  a sensitivity analysis model is used to measure the potential loss in future earnings of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates or foreign currency values 
the sensitivity analysis model quantifies the estimated potential effect of unfavorable movements of in foreign currencies to which the company was exposed at december  through its foreign currency exchange contracts 
the estimated maximum one day loss from the company s foreign currency exchange contracts  calculated using the sensitivity analysis model described above  is million at december  the portion of the estimated loss associated with foreign currency exchange contracts that offset the remeasurement gain and loss of 
table of contents the related foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities is million at december  and would impact earnings 
the company believes that such a hypothetical loss from its foreign currency exchange contracts would be partially offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged 
the sensitivity analysis model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in earnings that will be incurred by the company  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates 
it also does not represent the maximum possible loss that may occur 
actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships  hedging instruments and hedge percentages  timing and other factors

the sensitivity analysis quantified that the incremental expense incurred by an increase of in interest rates would be nominal over a twelve month period
