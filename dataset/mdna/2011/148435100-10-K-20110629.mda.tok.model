item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our objective is to continue building a distinctive portfolio of global premium and super premium spirits and fine wine brands as we move towards profitability 
to achieve this  we continue to seek to increase revenues from our more profitable brands 
we continue to focus our distribution relationships  sales expertise and targeted marketing activities on our more profitable brands  improve value chain and manage cost structure 
we have undergone a comprehensive review and analysis of our supply chains and cost structures both on a company wide and brand by brand basis 
this included personnel reductions throughout our company  restructuring our international distribution system  reducing inventory levels  changing distributor relationships in certain markets  moving production of certain products to a lower cost facility in the us  and reducing general and administrative costs 
we continue to review costs and seek to reduce expense  and selectively add new premium brands to our portfolio 
we intend to continue developing new brands and pursuing strategic relationships  joint ventures and acquisitions to selectively expand our premium spirits and fine wine portfolio  particularly by capitalizing on and expanding our partnering capabilities 
our criteria for new brands focuses on underserved areas of the beverage alcohol marketplace  while examining the potential for direct financial contribution to our company and the potential for future growth based on development and maturation of agency brands 
we evaluate future acquisitions and agency relationships on the basis of their potential to be immediately accretive and their potential contributions to our objectives of becoming profitable and further expanding our product offerings 
we expect that future acquisitions  if consummated  would involve some combination of cash  debt and the issuance of our stock 
recent events million private placement to support our liquidity needs as we pursue a path towards profitability  in june we entered into agreements relating to a private placement of an aggregate of approximately million of newly designated series a preferred stock

share repurchase in june  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at a price of per share in a privately negotiated transaction 
also  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to an additional million shares of our common stock 
as of the date of this report  no shares of our common stock had been repurchased under the repurchase program 
operations overview we generate revenue through the sale of our products to our network of wholesale distributors or  in control states  state operated agencies  which  in turn  distribute our brands to retail outlets 
in the us  our sales price per case includes excise tax and import duties  which are also reflected as a corresponding increase in our cost of sales 
most of our international sales are sold in bond  with the excise taxes paid by our customers upon shipment  thereby resulting in lower relative revenue as well as a lower relative cost of sales  although some of our united kingdom sales are sold tax paid  as in the united states 
the difference between sales and net sales principally reflects adjustments for various distributor incentives 
our gross profit is determined by the prices at which we sell our products  our ability to control our cost of sales  the relative mix of our case sales by brand and geography and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
our cost of sales is principally driven by our cost of procurement  bottling and packaging  which differs by brand  as well as freight and warehousing costs 
we purchase certain products  such as gosling s rums  pallini liqueurs  a 
de fussingy cognacs and tierras tequila  as finished goods 
for other products  such as jefferson s bourbons  we purchase the components  including the distilled spirits  bottles and packaging materials  and have arrangements with third parties for bottling and packaging 
our us sales typically have a higher absolute gross margin than in other markets  as sales prices per case are generally higher in the us selling expense principally includes advertising and marketing expenditures and compensation paid to our marketing and sales personnel 
our selling expense  as a percentage of sales and per case  is higher than that of our competitors because of our brand development costs  level of marketing expenditures and established sales force versus our relatively small base of case sales and sales volumes 
however  we believe that maintaining an infrastructure capable of supporting future growth is the correct long term approach for us 
while we expect the absolute level of selling expense to increase in the coming years  we expect selling expense as a percentage of revenues and on a per case basis to decline  as our volumes expand and our sales team sells a larger number of brands 
general and administrative expense relates to corporate and administrative functions that support our operations and includes administrative payroll  occupancy and related expenses and professional services 
we expect general and administrative expense in fiscal to be lower than fiscal  as we have restructured our fine wine division and our international operations and continue to control core spending 
we expect our general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales to decline due to economies of scale 
we expect to increase our case sales in the us and internationally over the next several years through organic growth  and through the extension of our product line via line extensions  acquisitions and distribution agreements 
we will seek to maintain liquidity and manage our working capital and overall capital resources during this period of anticipated growth to achieve our long term objectives  although there is no assurance that we will be able to do so 
we continue to believe the following industry trends will create growth opportunities for us  including the divestiture of smaller and emerging non core brands by major spirits companies as they continue to consolidate  increased barriers to entry  particularly in the us  due to continued consolidation and the difficulty in establishing an extensive distribution network  such as the one we maintain  the trend by small private and family owned spirits brand owners to partner with  or be acquired by  a company with global distribution 
we expect to be an attractive alternative to our larger competitors for these brand owners as one of the few modestly sized publicly traded spirits companies  and growth in the non spirits segments of the beverage alcohol industry  particularly wine  which may allow us to grow our portfolio and leverage our distribution network 
our growth strategy is based upon partnering with other brands  acquiring smaller and emerging brands and growing existing brands 
to identify potential partner and acquisition candidates we plan to rely on our management s industry experience and our extensive network of industry contacts 
we also plan to maintain and grow our us and international distribution channels so that we are more attractive to spirits companies who are looking for a route to market for their products 
we expect to compete for foreign and small private and family owned spirits brands by offering flexible and creative structures  which present an alternative to the larger spirits companies 
we intend to finance our brand acquisitions through a combination of our available cash resources  third party financing and  in appropriate circumstances  the further issuance of equity and or debt securities 
acquiring additional brands could have a significant effect on our financial position  and could cause substantial fluctuations in our quarterly and yearly operating results 
also  the pursuit of acquisitions and other new business relationships may require significant management attention 
we may not be able to successfully identify attractive acquisition candidates  obtain financing on favorable terms or complete these types of transactions in a timely manner and on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
financial performance overview the following table provides information regarding our case sales for the periods presented based on nine liter equivalent cases  which is a standard industry metric 
years ended march  cases united states international total rum vodka liqueurs whiskey tequila wine other total percentage of cases united states international total rum vodka liqueurs whiskey tequila wine other total critical accounting policies and estimates a number of estimates and assumptions affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  amounts of sales and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors and circumstances 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions discussed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations in that they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and form the basis for the accounting policies deemed to be most critical to our operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when the product is shipped to a customer generally a distributor  title and risk of loss has passed to the customer under the terms of sale fob shipping point or fob destination and collection is reasonably assured 
we do not offer a right of return but will accept returns if we shipped the wrong product or wrong quantity 
revenue is not recognized on shipments to control states in the united states until such time as the product is sold through to the retail channel 
accounts receivable we record trade accounts receivable at net realizable value 
this value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the trade accounts receivable balances and charged to the provision for doubtful accounts 
we calculate this allowance based on our history of write offs  level of past due accounts based on contractual terms of the receivables and our relationships with  and economic status of  our customers 
inventory valuation our inventory  which consists of distilled spirits  bulk wine  dry good raw materials bottles  labels and caps  packaging and finished goods  is valued at the lower of cost or market  using the weighted average cost method 
we assess the valuation of our inventories and reduce the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of our forecasted usage to their estimated realizable value 
we estimate the net realizable value of such inventories based on analyses and assumptions including  but not limited to  historical usage  future demand and market requirements 
reduction to the carrying value of inventories is recorded in cost of goods sold 
goodwill and other intangible assets as of march  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  of goodwill that arose from acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
intangible assets with indefinite lives consist primarily of rights  trademarks  trade names and formulations 
we are required to analyze our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis as well as when events and circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
certain factors that may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include  but are not limited to  operating results that are lower than expected and adverse industry or market economic trends 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets using a two step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level 
in the first step the fair value for the reporting unit is compared to its book value including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value  a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the book value of the goodwill 
the fair value for the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair values of the reporting units and the net fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of such reporting units 
if the fair value of the goodwill is less than the book value  the difference is recognized as an impairment 
the fair value of each reporting unit was determined at each of march  and by weighting a combination of the present value of our discounted anticipated future operating cash flows and values based on market multiples of revenue and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda of comparable companies 
we did not record an impairment on goodwill or other intangible assets for fiscal or intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to the estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we are required to amortize intangible assets with estimable useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives to the estimated residual values and to review intangible assets with estimable useful lives for impairment in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
stock based awards we follow current authoritative guidance regarding stock based compensation  which requires all share based payments  including grants of stock options  to be recognized in the income statement as an operating expense  based on their fair values on the grant date 
stock based compensation was million for each of fiscal and we used the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted 
the assumptions used in valuing the options granted during fiscal and are included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
fair value of financial instruments asc  financial instruments asc  defines the fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties and requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments 
we believe that there is no material difference between the fair value and the reported amounts of financial instruments in the balance sheets due to the short term maturity of these instruments  or with respect to the debt  as compared to the current borrowing rates available to us 
further  our investments have been classified within level of asc and are reported at fair value 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales of certain items in our consolidated financial statements 
years ended march  sales  net cost of sales reversal of provision for obsolete inventory gross profit selling expense general and administrative expense depreciation and amortization loss from operations other income other expense loss from equity investment in non consolidated affiliate foreign exchange loss gain interest expense income  net gain on sale of intangible asset gain on exchange of note payable income tax benefit net loss net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests net loss attributable to common shareholders the following is a reconciliation of net loss attributable to common shareholders to ebitda  as adjusted years ended march  net loss attributable to common shareholders adjustments interest expense income  net income tax benefit depreciation and amortization ebitda loss allowance for doubtful accounts allowance for obsolete inventory stock based compensation expense severance expense other income other expense loss from equity investment in non consolidated affiliate foreign exchange loss gain gain on sale of intangible asset gain on exchange of note payable net income attributable to noncontrolling interests ebitda  as adjusted our ebitda  as adjusted  improved to million for the year ended march   as compared to million for the comparable prior year period  primarily as a result of our increased sales and decreases in our general and administrative expense 
these improvements were offset by an increase in selling expense  primarily due to the costs associated with our fine wine division 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  adjusted for allowances for doubtful accounts and obsolete inventory  non cash compensation expense and severance charges is a key metric we use in evaluating our financial performance 
ebitda is considered a non gaap financial measure as defined by regulation g promulgated by the sec under the securities act of  as amended 
we consider ebitda  as adjusted  important in evaluating our performance on a consistent basis across various periods 
due to the significance of non cash and non recurring items  ebitda  as adjusted  enables our board of directors and management to monitor and evaluate the business on a consistent basis 
we use ebitda  as adjusted  as a primary measure  among others  to analyze and evaluate financial and strategic planning decisions regarding future operating investments and allocation of capital resources 
we believe that ebitda  as adjusted  eliminates items that are not indicative of our core operating performance  such as severance expense  or do not involve a cash outlay  such as stock based compensation expense 
ebitda  as adjusted  should be considered in addition to  rather than as a substitute for  income from operations  net income and cash flows from operating activities 
fiscal compared with fiscal net sales 
net sales increased to million for the year ended march   as compared to million for the comparable prior year period 
our us case sales as a percentage of total case sales increased to for the year ended march   as compared to for the comparable prior year period due to the organic growth of certain brands and the introduction of three new brands into the us market 
our international case sales suffered from changes in wholesalers and increased price competition in the vodka category  which also affected vodka sales in the us us net sales increased to million for the year ended march  from million for the comparable prior year period 
us net sales include million in revenue from sales of our betts scholl wines  which we acquired in september  million in revenue from sales of the travis hasse pie liqueurs  which we launched in september  and million in revenue from sales of the a 
de fussigny cognacs  which we launched in august the growth in us sales reflects the momentum for our gosling s rums  jefferson s bourbons  irish whiskies and brady s irish cream 
the table below presents the increase or decrease  as applicable  in case sales by product category for the year ended march  as compared to the year ended march  increase decrease percentage in case sales increase decrease overall us overall us rum vodka liqueurs whiskey tequila wine other total gross profit 
gross profit increased to million for the year ended march  from million for the comparable prior year period  while our gross margin decreased to for the year ended march  compared to for the comparable prior year period 
during the years ended march  and  we recorded reversals of our allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory of million and million  respectively 
we recorded these reversals because we were able to sell certain goods included in the allowance recorded during previous fiscal years 
absent the reversals of the allowance  our gross profit was million and million for the years ended march  and  respectively  and our gross margin was and  respectively 
selling expense 
selling expense increased to million for the year ended march  from million for the comparable prior year period 
this increase in selling expense resulted from million in increased employee expense due to the addition of staff in our fine wine division  million in severance charges  and an increase of million in shipping costs to our distributors due to our move to delivered pricing in which we are responsible for all shipping charges to our distributors and include these charges in our price to the distributor 
previously  the individual distributors were responsible for shipping costs 
this increase in selling expense was offset by a decrease in advertising  marketing and promotion expense of million for the year ended march  compared to the comparable prior year period 
the increase in selling expense was substantially offset by an increase in sales  resulting in selling expense as a percentage of net sales of for each of the years ended march  and general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense decreased to million for the year ended march  as compared to million for the comparable prior year period  primarily due to decreases of million in professional fees and million in employee expense due to our ongoing cost containment efforts 
also  the year ended march  included million in bad debt expense due to the insolvency of certain international distributors 
as a result of decreased expenses and an increase in sales in the current period  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended march  as compared to for the comparable prior year period 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization was million for each of the years ended march  and loss from operations 
as a result of the foregoing  our loss from operations improved to million for the year ended march  from million for the comparable prior year period 
as a result of our focus on our stronger growth markets and better performing brands  and expected growth from our existing brands  recently acquired brands and brands we may acquire in the future  we anticipate improved results of operations in the near term as compared to comparable prior year periods  although there is no assurance that we will attain such results 
loss from equity investment in non consolidated affiliate 
we have accounted for our investment in dp castle partners  llc on the equity method of accounting 
loss from this investment was million for the year ended march  foreign exchange loss gain 
foreign exchange loss for the year ended march  was million as compared to a gain of million for the year ended march  due to the weakening of the us dollar against the euro and its effect on our euro denominated intercompany balances due to our foreign subsidiaries for inventory purchases 
in november  to improve the liquidity of our foreign subsidiaries  we converted our intercompany balances due from our foreign subsidiaries into an additional investment in these subsidiaries 
beginning december   any translation gain or loss from the restatement of any investment in our foreign subsidiaries will be included in other comprehensive income 
prior to this conversion  we considered these transactions to be trading balances and short term funding subject to transaction adjustment under asc  foreign currency matters 
as such  at each balance sheet date  we restated the euro denominated intercompany advances included on the books of the foreign subsidiaries in us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date  with the resulting foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in net loss 
interest expense income  net 
we had interest expense  net of million for the year ended march  as compared to interest income  net of million for the year ended march  the increase in interest expense is due to the outstanding balances on our notes payable as described below in liquidity and capital resources  particularly our million revolving credit facility  the frost note and the december promissory notes 
we expect interest expense to decrease in future periods due to the frost note and the december promissory notes converting to series a preferred stock following shareholder approval as part of the private placement transaction described above 
gain on sale of intangible asset 
in november  we sold our sam houston bourbon brand to a third party for million in cash 
this sale resulted in a gain of million for the year ended march  gain on exchange of note payable 
in may  we exchanged our subsidiary outstanding note payable for  shares of our common stock 
this resulted in a pre tax  non cash gain of million for the year ended march  net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 
net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests during the year ended march  amounted to a loss of million as compared to a loss of million for the comparable prior year period  both the result of allocated net results recorded by our owned subsidiary  gosling castle partners  inc net loss attributable to common shareholders 
as a result of the net effects of the foregoing  net loss attributable to common shareholders for the year ended march  increased to a loss of million from a loss of million for the year ended march  net loss per common share  basic and diluted  was per share for the year ended march  as compared to per share for the comparable prior year period 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results and seasonality our industry is subject to seasonality with peak sales in each major category generally occurring in the fourth calendar quarter  which is our third fiscal quarter 
this holiday demand typically results in slightly higher sales for us in our second and or third fiscal quarters 
liquidity and capital resources overview since our inception  we have incurred significant operating and net losses and have not generated positive cash flows from operations 
for the year ended march   we had a net loss of million  and used cash of million in operating activities

also  we will issue approximately million of additional series a preferred stock for its stated value and warrants to purchase an aggregate of approximately million additional shares of our common stock  to certain of our directors  officers and other affiliates following shareholder approval of such issuance in accordance with the rules and regulations of the nyse amex

holders of approximately of our outstanding common stock have entered into irrevocable agreements to vote their shares in connection with the transactions 
we believe that the financing described above  combined with our current cash and working capital  will enable us to fund our losses until profitability  ensure continuity of supply of certain of our brands  fund future acquisitions and agency relationships  and support new brand initiatives and marketing programs 
the additional capital enhances our ability to attract new brands  further strengthens our relationships with our distributors and should enable us to access more traditional third party working capital financing

currency translation the functional currencies for our foreign operations are the euro in ireland and the british pound in the united kingdom 
with respect to our consolidated financial statements  the translation from the applicable foreign currencies to us dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate during the period 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
in november  to improve the liquidity of our foreign subsidiaries  we converted our intercompany balances due from our foreign subsidiaries into an additional investment in these subsidiaries 
beginning december   the translation gain or loss from the restatement of any investment in our foreign subsidiaries will be included in other comprehensive income 
prior to this conversion  we considered these transactions to be trading balances and short term funding subject to transaction adjustment under asc  foreign currency matters 
as such  at each balance sheet date  we restated the euro denominated intercompany advances included on the books of the foreign subsidiaries in us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date  with the resulting foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in net loss 
where in this annual report we refer to amounts in euros or british pounds  we have for your convenience also in certain cases provided a conversion of those amounts to us dollars in parentheses 
where the numbers refer to a specific balance sheet account date or financial statement account period  we have used the exchange rate that was used to perform the conversions in connection with the applicable financial statement 
in all other instances  unless otherwise indicated  the conversions have been made using the exchange rates as of march   each as calculated from the interbank exchange rates as reported by oanda 
com 
on march   the exchange rate of the euro and the british pound in exchange for us dollars was us equivalent to us and us equivalent to us 
these conversions should not be construed as representations that the euro and british pound amounts actually represent us dollar amounts or could be converted into us dollars at the rates indicated

inflation and changing prices did not have a material impact on our operations during fiscal or severe increases in inflation  however  could affect the global and us economies and could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations
