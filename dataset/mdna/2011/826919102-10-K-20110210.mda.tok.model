item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements 
please see the cautionary statement and risk factors above for discussions of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
our fiscal year end financial reporting periods are a or week year ending on the saturday closest to december st 
fiscal and were week years and ended on january  and january   respectively 
fiscal year was a week year with the extra week occurring in the first quarter and ended on january  
table of contents overview we design and develop proprietary  analog intensive  mixed signal integrated circuits ics for a broad range of applications 
mixed signal ics are electronic components that convert real world analog signals  such as sound and radio waves  into digital signals that electronic products can process 
therefore  mixed signal ics are critical components in a broad range of applications in a variety of markets  including communications  consumer  industrial  automotive  medical and power management 
our major customers include apple  cisco  huawei  lg electronics  nokia  pace formerly philips  panasonic  samsung  technicolor formerly thomson and varian medical systems 
as a fabless semiconductor company  we rely on third party semiconductor fabricators in asia  and to a lesser extent the united states and europe  to manufacture the silicon wafers that reflect our ic designs 
each wafer contains numerous die  which are cut from the wafer to create a chip for an ic 
we rely on third parties in asia to assemble  package  and  in most cases  test these devices and ship these units to our customers 
testing performed by such third parties facilitates faster delivery of products to our customers particularly those located in asia  shorter production cycle times  lower inventory requirements  lower costs and increased flexibility of test capacity 
our expertise in analog intensive  high performance  mixed signal ics enables us to develop highly differentiated solutions that address multiple markets 
we group our products into the following categories broad based products  which include our microcontrollers  timing products clocks and oscillators  wireless receivers  isolation devices and human interface sensors  broadcast products  which include our broadcast audio and video products  access products  which include our embedded modems  voice over ip voip products and our power over ethernet devices  and mature products  which include certain devices that are at the end of their respective life cycles and therefore receive minimal or no continued research and development investment  including our dsl analog front end ics and irda devices 
through acquisitions and internal development efforts  we have continued to diversify our product portfolio and introduce next generation ics with added functionality and further integration 
in april  we acquired silicon clocks  inc  a privately held company that designed and developed microelectromechanical system mems technology to enable the manufacture of silicon resonators and sensors directly on standard cmos wafers 
the acquired technology is aligned with our efforts to leverage our cmos based timing products into high volume applications such as consumer electronics 
in october  we acquired chipsensors ltd  a privately held company that created innovative single chip cmos sensors designed to detect temperature  humidity and gases 
in fiscal  we introduced a bridge chip family that simplifies the addition of usb and touch sense connectivity in embedded designs  the expansion of our automotive portfolio with a family of highly integrated am fm tuners for car stereos  frequency flexible in circuit programmable cmos clock generators  isolated gate drivers designed for high power class d audio systems  power management ics that improve efficiency in power over ethernet poe equipment  a class d amplifier ideal for many portable radios and docking stations  a wireless ic solution designed to be a remote control on a chip  low power capacitive touch sense microcontrollers  digital isolators and isolated gate drivers designed to replace traditional optocouplers  a digital tv demodulator that combines satellite  terrestrial and cable digital video broadcast dvb functions in one highly integrated device  a frequency flexible timing ic solution for networking and telecommunications applications  a family of ultra low power wireless microcontrollers ideal for battery powered systems and a highly integrated am fm receiver for analog tuned radios 
we plan to continue to introduce products that increase the 
table of contents content we provide for existing applications  thereby enabling us to serve markets we do not currently address and expanding our total available market opportunity 
we had no customers that accounted for more than of our revenues during fiscal or during fiscal  we had one customer  samsung  whose purchases across a variety of product areas represented of our total revenues 
in addition to direct sales to customers  some of our end customers purchase products indirectly from us through distributors and contract manufacturers 
an end customer purchasing through a contract manufacturer typically instructs such contract manufacturer to obtain our products and incorporate such products with other components for sale by such contract manufacturer to the end customer 
although we actually sell the products to  and are paid by  the distributors and contract manufacturers  we refer to such end customer as our customer 
two of our distributors  edom technology and avnet  represented and of our revenues during fiscal  and and of our revenues during fiscal  respectively 
edom represented of our revenues during fiscal there were no other distributors or contract manufacturers that accounted for more than of our revenues in fiscal  or the percentage of our revenues derived from customers located outside of the united states was in fiscal and in fiscal and all of our revenues to date have been denominated in us dollars 
we believe that a majority of our revenues will continue to be derived from customers outside of the united states 
the sales cycle for our ics can be as long as months or more 
an additional three to six months or more are usually required before a customer ships a significant volume of devices that incorporate our ics 
due to this lengthy sales cycle  we typically experience a significant delay between incurring research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses  and the corresponding sales 
consequently  if sales in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and our operating results for that quarter and  potentially  future quarters would be adversely affected 
moreover  the amount of time between initial research and development and commercialization of a product  if ever  can be substantially longer than the sales cycle for the product 
accordingly  if we incur substantial research and development costs without developing a commercially successful product  our operating results  as well as our growth prospects  could be adversely affected 
because many of our ics are designed for use in consumer products such as televisions  personal video recorders  set top boxes  portable navigation devices and mobile handsets  we expect that the demand for our products will be typically subject to some degree of seasonal demand 
however  rapid changes in our markets and across our product areas make it difficult for us to accurately estimate the impact of seasonal factors on our business 
results of operations the following describes the line items set forth in our consolidated statements of income revenues 
revenues are generated almost exclusively by sales of our ics 
we recognize revenue on sales when all of the following criteria are met there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery of goods has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
generally  we recognize revenue from product sales to direct customers and contract manufacturers upon shipment 
certain of our sales are made to distributors under agreements allowing certain rights of return and price protection on products unsold by distributors 
accordingly  we defer the revenue and cost of revenue on such sales until the distributors sell the product to the end customer 
our products typically carry a one year replacement warranty 
replacements have been insignificant to date 
our revenues are subject to variation from period to period due to the volume of shipments made within a period  the mix of products we sell and the prices we charge for our products 
the vast majority of our revenues were negotiated at prices that reflect a discount from the list prices 
table of contents for our products 
these discounts are made for a variety of reasons  including to establish a relationship with a new customer  as an incentive for customers to purchase products in larger volumes  to provide profit margin to our distributors who resell our products or in response to competition 
in addition  as a product matures  we expect that the average selling price for such product will decline due to the greater availability of competing products 
our ability to increase revenues in the future is dependent on increased demand for our established products and our ability to ship larger volumes of those products in response to such demand  as well as our ability to develop or acquire new products and subsequently achieve customer acceptance of newly introduced products 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues includes the cost of purchasing finished silicon wafers processed by independent foundries  costs associated with assembly  test and shipping of those products  costs of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing support  logistics and quality assurance  costs of software royalties and amortization of purchased software  other intellectual property license costs and certain acquired intangible assets  an allocated portion of our occupancy costs  and allocable depreciation of testing equipment and leasehold improvements 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of personnel related expenses  including stock compensation  new product mask  wafer  packaging and test costs  external consulting and services costs  equipment tooling  equipment depreciation  amortization of acquired intangible assets  as well as an allocated portion of our occupancy costs for such operations 
research and development activities include the design of new products  refinement of existing products and design of test methodologies to ensure compliance with required specifications 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel related expenses  including stock compensation  related allocable portion of our occupancy costs  sales commissions to independent sales representatives  applications engineering support  professional fees  legal fees and promotional and marketing expenses 
in process research and development 
in process research and development ipr d represents acquired technology resulting from business combinations that had not achieved technological feasibility as of the acquisition closing date and had no alternative future use 
for acquisitions occurring prior to fiscal  these costs were expensed on the date of acquisition 
beginning in fiscal  ipr d is capitalized until the related projects are completed  at which time they begin to be amortized 
ipr d is written off if the related projects are abandoned 
interest income 
interest income reflects interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investment balances 
interest expense 
interest expense consists of interest on our short and long term obligations 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net consists primarily of foreign currency remeasurement adjustments as well as other non operating income and expenses 
provision benefit for income taxes 
provision benefit for income taxes includes both domestic and foreign income taxes at the applicable statutory rates adjusted for non deductible expenses  research and development tax credits and other permanent differences

unit volumes of our products increased compared to fiscal by 
average selling prices increased during the same period by 
in general  as our products become more mature  we expect to experience decreases in average selling prices 
we anticipate that newly announced  higher priced  next generation products and product derivatives will offset some of these decreases 
gross margin year ended in millions january  january  change change gross margin percent of revenue the increase in the dollar amount of gross margin in fiscal was primarily due to our increased sales 
the increase in gross margin as a percent of revenue in fiscal was primarily due to changes in product mix  improvements in our inventory management and manufacturing cost 
table of contents reductions 
we may experience declines in the average selling prices of certain of our products 
this creates downward pressure on gross margin as a percentage of revenues and may be offset to the extent we are able to introduce higher margin new products and gain market share with our ics  achieve lower production costs from our wafer suppliers and third party assembly and test subcontractors  achieve lower production costs per unit as a result of improved yields throughout the manufacturing process  or reduce logistics costs 
research and development year ended in millions january  january  change change research and development percent of revenue the increase in research and development expense in fiscal was principally due to an increase of million for personnel related expenses 
we expect that research and development expense will continue to increase in absolute dollars in the first quarter of recent development projects include a bridge chip family that simplifies the addition of usb and touch sense connectivity in embedded designs  the expansion of our automotive portfolio with a family of highly integrated am fm tuners for car stereos  frequency flexible in circuit programmable cmos clock generators  isolated gate drivers designed for high power class d audio systems  power management ics that improve efficiency in poe equipment  a class d amplifier ideal for many portable radios and docking stations  a wireless ic solution designed to be a remote control on a chip  low power capacitive touch sense microcontrollers  digital isolators and isolated gate drivers designed to replace traditional optocouplers  a digital tv demodulator that combines satellite  terrestrial and cable dvb functions in one highly integrated device  a frequency flexible timing ic solution for networking and telecommunications applications  a family of ultra low power wireless microcontrollers ideal for battery powered systems and a highly integrated am fm receiver for analog tuned radios 
in process research and development in connection with the purchase of silicon clocks  we acquired certain in process research and development ipr d assets

this rate reflects the weighted average cost of capital and the risks inherent in the development process 
the ipr d recorded in connection with the acquisition consisted of the following in thousands project fair value resonator clocks we are developing the ipr d projects using mems technology 
the remaining research and development efforts include additional design  integration and testing 
as of the acquisition date  we projected the costs to complete the projects to be million 
such costs have been consistent with our assumptions at the time of the acquisition 
the significant risks associated with the successful completion of these projects include our potential inability to finish the product designs  produce 
table of contents working models and gain customer acceptance 
failure to complete these projects in a timely manner could result in lost revenues 
selling  general and administrative year ended in millions january  january  change change selling  general and administrative percent of revenue the increase in selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal was principally due to an increase of million for legal fees  primarily related to acquisition related costs and litigation 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense as a percent of revenues in fiscal is due to our increased sales 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expense will increase in absolute dollars in the first quarter of interest income year ended in millions january  january  change interest income the decrease in interest income in fiscal was largely due to lower interest rates on the underlying instruments  partially offset by a higher average investment balance 
interest expense interest expense in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal other income expense  net other income expense  net in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal the change was primarily due to foreign currency remeasurement adjustments 
provision benefit for income taxes year ended in millions january  january  change provision benefit for income taxes effective tax rate the effective tax rate for fiscal increased from the prior period  primarily due to the resolution of uncertain tax positions as a result of entering into an advance pricing agreement with the us internal revenue service during the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  the effective tax rate for fiscal increased from the prior period due to the intercompany license of certain technology obtained in the acquisition of silicon clocks during the second quarter of fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by an increase in the federal research and development credit in fiscal the effective tax rates for each of the periods presented differ from the federal statutory rate of due to the amount of income earned in foreign jurisdictions where the tax rate may be lower than 
table of contents the federal statutory rate  research and development tax credits and other permanent items including changes to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenues year ended in millions january  january  change change revenues the growth in revenues in fiscal was driven primarily by market share gains

average selling prices decreased during the same period by 
gross margin year ended in millions january  january  change change gross margin percent of revenue the increase in the dollar amount of gross margin in fiscal was primarily due to our increased sales 
the increase in gross margin as a percent of revenue in fiscal was primarily due to a charge of million to record inventory acquired from integration associates at fair value during fiscal  improvements in our inventory management and manufacturing cost reductions

table of contents in process research and development in process research and development ipr d recorded in connection with the acquisition of integration associates was million in fiscal the ipr d projects included optoelectronic  power  and radio transmitter and transceiver technologies 
the optoelectronic projects are used for infrared data communications and proximity sensing 
the power projects enable ac dc conversion in power supply systems 
the radio transmitters and transceivers projects enable the delivery of data over proprietary  short range wireless links 
the fair value of each project was determined using the income approach 
the discount rate applicable to the cash flows was 
this rate reflects the weighted average cost of capital and the risks inherent in the development process 
there was no acquisition of ipr d in fiscal interest income year ended in millions january  january  change interest income the decrease in interest income for the recent period was due to lower interest rates on the underlying instruments and lower average cash and investment balances

the effective tax rates for each of the periods presented differ from the federal statutory rate of due to the amount of income earned in foreign jurisdictions where the tax rate may be lower than the federal statutory rate  the limited deductibility of stock compensation expense and other permanent items including changes to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

table of contents business outlook we expect revenues in the first quarter of fiscal to be in the range of to million 
furthermore  we expect our diluted earnings per share  exclusive of expected charges related to the january acquisition of spectra linear  to be in the range of to 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity as of january  consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our cash equivalents and short term investments consist primarily of corporate bonds  us treasury bills  money market funds  variable rate demand notes  municipal bonds  us government agency bonds and discount notes  international government bonds  certificates of deposit and commercial paper 
our long term investments consist of auction rate securities 
early in fiscal  auctions for many of our auction rate securities failed because sell orders exceeded buy orders 
as of january   we held million par value auction rate securities  all of which have experienced failed auctions 
the securities had previously been valued using quoted prices in active markets 
when the auctions began to fail  quoted prices for the securities were no longer observable 
as such  we changed our fair value measurement methodology for all auction rate securities from quoted prices in active markets to a cash flow model 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  amount of cash flows  expected holding periods of the securities and a discount to reflect our inability to liquidate the securities 
the underlying assets of our auction rate securities consisted of student loans and municipal bonds  of which million were guaranteed by the us government and the remaining million were privately insured 
as of january   million of the auction rate securities had credit ratings of aaa and million had credit ratings of a 
these securities had contractual maturity dates ranging from to and were yielding to per year at january  we are receiving the underlying cash flows on all of our auction rate securities 
the principal amounts associated with failed auctions are not expected to be accessible until a successful auction occurs  the issuer redeems the security  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the underlying securities mature 
we are unable to predict if these funds will become available before their maturity dates 
we do not expect to need access to the capital represented by any of our auction rate securities prior to their maturities 
we do not intend to sell  and we believe that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell  our auction rate securities before their anticipated recovery in market value or final settlement at the underlying par value 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during fiscal  compared to net cash provided of million during fiscal operating cash flows during fiscal reflect our net income of million  adjustments of million for depreciation  amortization  stock compensation and deferred income taxes  and a net cash outflow of million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities 
accounts receivable decreased to million at january  from million at january  the decrease in accounts receivable resulted primarily from a decrease in shipments during the last quarter of fiscal compared to the last quarter of the prior year 
our average days sales outstanding dso was days at january  and days at january  inventory increased to million at january  from million at january  our inventory level is primarily impacted by our need to make purchase commitments to support forecasted demand and variations between forecasted and actual demand 
the increase in inventory over the prior year resulted primarily from actual demand falling short of our forecasted demand 
our average days of inventory doi was days at january  and days at january  
table of contents net cash used in investing activities was million during fiscal  compared to net cash used of million during fiscal the decrease was principally due to a decrease of million in net outflows for purchases of investments  offset by an increase in net payments of million for the acquisition of businesses 
we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately to million for fiscal additionally  as part of our growth strategy  we expect to evaluate opportunities to invest in or acquire other businesses  intellectual property or technologies that would complement or expand our current offerings  expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities 
on january   we acquired spectra linear  a privately held company  for approximately million in cash  subject to certain working capital adjustments  plus potential additional consideration of up to million tied to the revenue of the acquired products exceeding million during net cash used in financing activities was million during fiscal  compared to net cash provided of million during fiscal the decrease in cash flows was principally due to an increase of million for repurchases of our common stock 
in july  our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million of our common stock prior to the end of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of january  in thousands payments due by period total thereafter operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term obligations operating lease obligations include amounts for leased facilities 
purchase obligations include contractual arrangements in the form of purchase orders with suppliers where there is a fixed non cancelable payment schedule or minimum payments due with a reduced delivery schedule 
we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when or if cash settlement with taxing authorities will occur for our unrecognized tax benefits 
therefore  our liability of million for unrecognized tax benefits is not included in the table above 
see note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of sales growth  market acceptance of our products  the timing and extent of research and development projects  potential acquisitions of companies or technologies and the expansion of our sales and marketing activities 
we believe our existing cash and investment balances are sufficient to meet our capital requirements through at least the next months  although we could be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding prior to that time 
we may enter into acquisitions or strategic arrangements in the future which also could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
off balance sheet arrangements in march  we entered into an operating lease agreement and a related participation agreement for a facility at w 
cesar chavez wcc in austin  texas for our corporate headquarters 
the lease has a term of seven years 
the base rent for the term of the lease is an amount equal to the interest accruing on million at basis points over the three month libor 
table of contents which would be approximately million over the remaining term assuming libor averages during such term 
in march  we entered into an operating lease agreement and a related participation agreement for a facility at w 
cesar chavez wcc in austin  texas for the expansion of our corporate headquarters 
the lease has a term of five years 
the base rent for the term of the lease is an amount equal to the interest accruing on million at basis points over the three month libor which would be approximately million over the remaining term assuming libor averages during such term 
we have granted certain rights and remedies to the lessors in the event of certain defaults  including the right to terminate the leases  to bring suit to collect damages  and to compel us to purchase the facilities 
the leases contain other customary representations  warranties  obligations  conditions  indemnification provisions and termination provisions  including covenants that we shall maintain unencumbered cash and highly rated short term investments of at least million 
if our unencumbered cash and highly rated short term investments are less than million  we must also maintain a ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation  amortization  lease expense and other non cash charges ebitdar over the four prior fiscal quarters of no greater than to as of january   we believe we were in compliance with all covenants of the leases 
during the terms of the leases  we have on going options to purchase the buildings for purchase prices of approximately million for wcc and million for wcc 
alternatively  we can cause each such property to be sold to third parties provided we are not in default under that property lease 
we are contingently liable on a first dollar loss basis for up to million to the extent that the wcc sale proceeds are less than the million purchase option and up to million to the extent that the wcc sale proceeds are less than the million purchase option 
we determined that the fair value associated with the guaranteed residual values was million for wcc and million for wcc  as of the inception of the leases 
these amounts were recorded in other assets  net and long term obligations and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized over the term of the leases 
we are required to periodically evaluate the expected fair value of each facility at the end of the lease terms 
if we determine that it is estimable and probable that the expected fair values will be less than million for wcc and million for wcc  we will ratably accrue the loss up to a maximum of approximately million and million  respectively  over the remaining lease terms as additional rent expense 
as of january   we do not believe that a loss contingency accrual is required for either property 
however  a prolonged economic downturn could increase the likelihood of such a loss accrual 
in connection with our headquarters leases  during fiscal we entered into interest rate swap agreements as a hedge against the variable rent under the leases 
under the terms of the swap agreements  we have effectively converted the variable rents to fixed rents through march for wcc and march for wcc 
see note  derivative financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported 
changes in facts and circumstances could have a significant impact on the resulting estimated amounts included in the financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting 
table of contents policies affect our more complex judgments and estimates 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenues and cost of revenues on sales to distributors  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
inventory valuation we assess the recoverability of inventories through the application of a set of methods  assumptions and estimates 
in determining net realizable value  we write down inventory that may be slow moving or have some form of obsolescence  including inventory that has aged more than months 
we also adjust the valuation of inventory when its standard cost exceeds the estimated market value 
we assess the potential for any unusual customer returns based on known quality or business issues and write off inventory losses for scrap or non saleable material 
inventory not otherwise identified to be written down is compared to an assessment of our month forecasted demand 
the result of this methodology is compared against the product life cycle and competitive situations in the marketplace to determine the appropriateness of the resulting inventory levels 
demand for our products may fluctuate significantly over time  and actual demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those that we project 
in the event that actual demand is lower or market conditions are worse than originally projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
stock based compensation we recognize the fair value of stock based compensation transactions in the consolidated statement of income 
the fair value of our stock based awards is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes valuation calculation requires us to estimate key assumptions such as future stock price volatility  expected terms  risk free rates and dividend yield 
expected stock price volatility is based on implied volatility from traded options on our stock in the marketplace and historical volatility of our stock 
the expected term of options granted is derived from an analysis of historical exercises and remaining contractual life of stock options  and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we have never paid cash dividends  and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends  and thus have assumed a dividend yield 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of our stock grants and only recognize the expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our stock based compensation cost  or if different assumptions had been used  we may have recorded too much or too little stock based compensation cost 
see note  stock based compensation  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
investments in auction rate securities we determine the fair value of our investments in auction rate securities using a discounted cash flow model 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  amount of cash flows  expected holding periods of the securities and a discount to reflect our inability to liquidate the securities 
for available for sale auction rate securities  if the calculated value is below the carrying amount of the securities  we then determine if the decline in value is other than temporary 
we consider various factors in determining whether an impairment is other than temporary  including the severity and duration of the impairment  changes in underlying credit ratings  forecasted recovery  our intent to sell or the likelihood that we would be required to sell the investment before its anticipated recovery in market value and the probability that the scheduled cash payments will continue to be made 
when we conclude that an other than temporary impairment has occurred  we assess whether we intend to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery 
if either of these two conditions is met  we recognize a charge in earnings equal to the entire difference between the security amortized cost basis and its fair value 
if we do not intend to sell a security or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery  
table of contents the unrealized loss is separated into an amount representing the credit loss  which is recognized in earnings  and the amount related to all other factors  which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
acquired intangible assets when we acquire a business  a portion of the purchase price is typically allocated to identifiable intangible assets  such as acquired technology and customer relationships 
fair value of these assets is determined primarily using the income approach  which requires us to project future cash flows and apply an appropriate discount rate 
we amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their expected useful lives 
our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
incorrect estimates could result in future impairment charges  and those charges could be material to our results of operations 
impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets we review long lived assets which are held and used  including fixed assets and purchased intangible assets  for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
such evaluations compare the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset over its expected useful life and are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices and volumes for our products  capital needs  economic trends and other factors which are inherently difficult to forecast 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  we record an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
we test our goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step of the impairment analysis compares our fair value to our net book value 
in determining fair value  the accounting guidance allows for the use of several valuation methodologies  although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value 
if the fair value is less than the net book value  the second step of the analysis compares the implied fair value of our goodwill to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  we recognize an impairment loss equal to that excess amount 
income taxes we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences in recognition of income loss for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step requires us to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that the tax position has met the threshold for recognition  therefore  we must evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the second step requires us to measure the tax benefit of the tax position taken  or expected to be taken  in an income tax return as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
this measurement step is inherently complex and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we re evaluate the uncertain tax positions each quarter based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  expirations of statutes of limitation  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period 

table of contents although we believe the measurement of our liabilities for uncertain tax positions is reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
if additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit or litigation  it could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made
