introduction globe specialty metals  inc  together with its subsidiaries collectively  gsm  we  or our is one of the leading manufacturers of silicon metal and silicon based alloys 
as of june   we owned and operated six principal manufacturing facilities  in two primary operating segments gmi  our us operations and  globe metales  our argentine operations 
business segments we operate in six reportable segments gmi a manufacturer of silicon metal and silicon based alloys located in the united states with plants in beverly  ohio  alloy  west virginia  niagara falls  new york  selma  alabama and bridgeport  alabama  globe metais a distributor of silicon metal manufactured in brazil 
this segment includes the historical brazilian manufacturing operations  comprised of a manufacturing plant in breu branco and mining operations and forest reserves  which were all sold on november  subsequent to this divestiture  globe metais net sales relate only to the fulfillment of certain retained customer contracts  which were completed as of december   globe metales a manufacturer of silicon based alloys located in argentina with a silicon based alloys plant in mendoza and a cored wire fabrication facility in san luis  solsil a developer and manufacturer of upgraded metallurgical grade silicon metal located in the united states with operations in beverly  ohio  corporate a corporate office including general expenses  investments  and related investment income  and other includes an electrode production operation in china yonvey and a cored wire production facility located in poland 
these operations do not fit into the above reportable segments  and are immaterial for purposes of separate disclosure 
overview and recent developments customer demand and pricing remain solid as our end markets for silicon metal and silicon based alloys  which include chemicals  steel  aluminum  and solar  continue to perform well 
during this summer there have been some reports that silicon metal spot sales and pricing were off slightly from their yearly high  which did not meaningfully affect us as the majority of our silicon metal sales are under annual contracts 
in particular  aluminum customers experienced a modest slow down  as auto production was temporarily disrupted due to the japanese earthquake 
overall  our end markets are performing well and have excellent prospects for continued growth 
in our chemicals end market  which represents producers of silicones  the single largest application for silicon metal  the large manufacturers are performing well and generally meeting their growth and earnings expectations 
polysilicon production and solar cell demand is also continuing its growth with new production capacity coming on line around the world  including two new plants being built in tennessee 
steel capacity utilization and auto production  two significant end markets  are both expected to grow  and aluminum production is also expected to increase 
we are presently running all of our furnaces in our six primary plants at full capacity  subject to normal maintenance outages 
during our fiscal fourth quarter  we had a planned major maintenance outage of the furnace at our bridgeport  alabama plant for approximately thirty days 
we also had an unplanned outage in bridgeport due to a five day power disruption from the april tornadoes 
we shipped approximately less material in this quarter as we did in the immediately preceding quarter  which only included one meaningful planned outage of a smaller furnace than bridgeport  primarily as a result of the bridgeport planned outage 
in the next quarter  ending september   we expect to have one planned outage 
however  in the following quarter ending december   we anticipate having several planned maintenance outages in our beverly  ohio  selma  alabama and niagara falls  new york plants in order to prepare our furnaces for calendar and to take advantage of the bonus depreciation tax deduction  which expires at the end of the calendar year 
we are nearing the beginning of construction of our new plant in iceland 
as we announced last quarter  we intend to build a  annual metric ton silicon metal plant in iceland 
we are building the plant with a minority partner  tomahawk development company tomahawk  who secured substantially all the environmental and operating permits and the land  and who will own approximately of the plant 
we obtained an year  competitively priced power contract for megawatts 
prior to beginning construction  which is expected to take place before the end of calendar  we have a few remaining steps to complete  including obtaining final board of directors approval 
the plant is expected to be operational in the second half of calendar the total project will cost approximately  and will be financed with  of financing provided by two commercial banks  approximately  of cash from gsm  and  from tomahawk 
net sales for the quarter ended june  increased  or  from the preceding quarter ended march   as a result of a increase in average selling price partially offset by a decrease in tons shipped 
the average selling price increased in the quarter due to increased silicon metal spot pricing  higher pricing of all our alloy products  which reset each quarter  a mix shift towards the higher priced alloys and the pass through of higher costs for certain raw materials 
during the quarter ended june   we incurred  of transaction related and due diligence expenses and had  of expenses related to the settlement of certain liabilities from our brazilian plant that we sold in november for a  gain 
the brazilian settlement represents the final ruling of an arbitration panel regarding a working capital dispute we had with camargo correa who sold us the brazilian plant in january also  the bridgeport planned maintenance outage added approximately  of expense to cost of goods sold in the quarter 
income before provision for income taxes totaled  in the quarter ended june   and included the  of transaction expenses and  of expenses related to the brazilian settlement 
this compares to income before provision for income taxes in the preceding quarter ended march  of  which included  of transaction expenses 
outlook we continue to be optimistic about the demand for our products as our end markets continue to grow 
we are operating at full capacity  subject to maintenance outages 
as demand has continued to improve  and all western world suppliers appear to be running at full capacity  prices for our products have increased 
we had a modest benefit in this quarter from this increase in silicon metal pricing from the fourth calendar quarter of  when our annual contracts were entered into 
we expect our average selling price of silicon metal to remain relatively flat for the remainder of calendar silicon based alloy pricing resets each quarter  and pricing is a function of overall supply and demand 
demand is largely derived from steel capacity utilization and auto production 
we benefited in this quarter from increasing silicon alloy pricing in all products  and expect pricing for the individual products to remain stable for the balance of calendar  while mix shifts may cause the average pricing to vary 
in addition  we were able to pass through to our customers increases in rare earth prices 
certain rare earths are used in the manufacture of magnesium ferrosilicon 
we expect a modest decline in tons sold in the quarter ending september  as we build inventory during the quarter in order to fulfill shipments under customer contracts in the following quarter when we have a significant number of planned maintenance outages 
as a result of the anticipated decrease in sales  we expect earnings to decline approximately in the quarter ending september   from the quarter ended june   and then  in the subsequent quarter  to return to the level of the quarter ended june  in addition  we expect all planned outages to be completed by the end of november  so that production will be at full capacity in december in july  we closed on the acquisition of alden resources  llc  north america s leading miner  processor and supplier of specialty metallurgical coal to the silicon and silicon based alloys industries and also a supplier of thermal coal to the power industry 
specialty metallurgical coal is a key ingredient in the production of silicon metal 
alden is a major supplier of this type of specialty metallurgical coal to globe and other silicon producers 
by acquiring alden  we secured a stable  long term and low cost supply of this key raw material to support continued growth worldwide while maintaining alden position as a leading supplier to other silicon and silicon based alloy producers 
charcoal  where available  is a more costly alternative to coal and whose cost gsm would have to incur without adequate coal supplies 
alden has approximately million tons of reserves of specialty metallurgical coal used predominately in the silicon and silicon based alloy industries 
alden is currently operating six mines in kentucky and tennessee 
currently alden supplies approximately  tons of coal annually to the silicon and silicon based alloy markets in north america and overseas  with small quantities including byproducts sold to the thermal market 
alden also owns and operates a coal preparation plant in eastern kentucky that washes and prepares the coal 
the plant is newly upgraded and capable of processing over million tons of coal per year 
we financed the acquisition with  million of bank debt  at an interest rate of approximately  and with  million of cash from gsm balance sheet 
in addition  the seller could receive a contingent payment of up to  million based on future performance 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from the estimates used under different assumptions or conditions 
business combinations we have completed a number of significant business acquisitions 
our business strategy contemplates that we may pursue additional acquisitions in the future 
when we acquire a business  the purchase price is allocated based on the fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired  and liabilities assumed 
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the residual of the excess of the consideration transferred  plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
we generally engage independent third party appraisal firms to assist in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates  especially with respect to intangible assets 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and may impact reported depreciation and amortization in future periods  as well as any related impairment of goodwill or other long lived assets 
goodwill at june   we had goodwill totaling  we annually review  in the third quarter of our fiscal year  goodwill for impairment 
a review is also performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill of the reporting unit 
fair value is measured based on a discounted cash flow method  using a discount rate determined by us to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model  or a valuation technique based on multiples of earnings consistent with the objective of measuring fair value 
the estimates of cash flows  future earnings  and discount rate are subject to change due to the economic environment and business trends  including such factors as raw material and product pricing  interest rates  expected market returns and volatility of markets served  as well as our future manufacturing capabilities  government regulation and technological change 
we believe that the estimates of future cash flows  future earnings  and fair value are reasonable  however  changes in estimates  circumstances or conditions could have a significant impact on our fair valuation determination  which could then result in a material impairment charge in our results of operations 
long lived assets at june   we had property  plant  and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization  totaling  including  associated with our solsil business unit 
solsil is currently focused on research and development projects and is not producing material for commercial sale 
we review the recoverability of our long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future undiscounted pretax cash flows of the related operations 
we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
if these undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset or asset group  an impairment loss is measured based on the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value 
assets to be disposed are written down to the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and depreciation ceases 
fair value is determined through various valuation techniques  including discounted cash flow models  quoted market values  and third party independent appraisals  as considered necessary 
we believe that the estimates of future cash flows  future earnings  and fair value are reasonable  however  changes in estimates  circumstances or conditions  including the results of solsil s research and development activities  could have a significant impact on our fair valuation determination  which could then result in a material impairment charge in our results of operations 
inventories at june   we had inventories totaling  inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value  which does not exceed net realizable value 
cost of inventories is determined either by the first in  first out method or by the average cost method 
when circumstances indicate a potential valuation issue  tests are performed to assess net realizable value  and as necessary  an inventory write down is recorded for obsolete  slow moving or defective inventory 
we estimate market and net realizable value based on current and future selling prices for our inventories  as well as the expected utilization of parts and supplies in our manufacturing process 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable  however  changes in estimates or future price decreases caused by changing economic conditions  including customer demand  could result in future inventory adjustments  resulting in decreased operating profits and lower asset levels 
share based compensation during the year ended june   we recorded share based compensation expense of  share based payments to the extent they are compensatory are recognized in our consolidated statement of operations based on their fair values 
we have applied the provisions of the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab in our accounting for share based compensation 
we are required to estimate the stock awards that we ultimately expect to vest and to reduce share based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period 
given our share based compensation was granted under a new plan and that there is limited historical data  we have estimated a forfeiture rate of zero 
actual forfeitures in the future may differ from this estimate  which would favorably impact our future results from operations 
we estimate the fair value of employee stock options using a black scholes valuation model 
our common stock is currently traded on the nasdaq global select market effective july  
accordingly  for stock awards granted subsequent to july   we value our common stock based upon the closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market on the date immediately preceding the date of grant 
prior to july   our common stock was traded on the aim market of the london stock exchange  and we valued our common stock based upon the closing price of our common stock on the aim market on the date immediately preceding the date of grant 
the fair value of an award is affected by our closing stock price as well as other assumptions  including the estimated volatility over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options  which is calculated using the simplified method allowed by sab as there is limited trading data related to our common stock  the expected volatility over the expected vesting term of our share based compensation is based upon the historical volatilities of similar companies 
the risk free interest rate assumption we use is based upon united states treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the award 
our expected dividend rate for grants prior to june  was zero as we did not pay cash dividends on our common stock and did not anticipate doing so 
actual results could differ from these estimates  which would impact our results from operations 
income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of  during the year ended june  as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense and temporary differences between tax and financial reporting 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
we must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized 
a valuation allowance is recognized to reduce deferred tax assets if  and to the extent that  it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the determination of the need for a valuation allowance is based on an on going evaluation of current information including  among other things  estimates of future earnings in different tax jurisdictions and the expected timing of deferred income tax asset and liability reversals 
we believe that the determination to record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred income tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because it is based  in part  on an estimate of future taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions in which we do business  which is susceptible to change and may or may not occur  as well as the estimated timing of the reversal of temporary differences  which give rise to our deferred income tax assets  and because the impact of adjusting a valuation allowance may be material 
in the event that actual results differ from estimates in future periods  and depending on the tax strategies that we may be able to implement  changes to the valuation allowance could impact our financial position and results of operations 
as part of our accounting for business combinations  some of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and intangible assets 
amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets is generally not tax deductible  however  deferred taxes have been recorded for non deductible amortization expense as a part of the purchase price allocation process 
we have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities 
income tax contingencies existing as of the acquisition dates of the acquired companies are evaluated quarterly and any adjustments are recorded as adjustments to income tax expense 
prior to our adoption of accounting standards codification subtopic  business combinations  on july   such adjustments were recorded to a reduce to zero any goodwill related to the acquisition  b reduce to zero other noncurrent intangible assets related to the acquisition  and c reduce income tax expense 
we recognize an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information  based on the technical merits of the position 
the income tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority 
the determination of an uncertain tax position and the likelihood of it being realized requires critical judgment and estimates 
we carefully assess each of the uncertain tax positions in order to determine the tax benefit that can be recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
we record and or disclose such potential tax liabilities  as appropriate  and reasonably estimate our income tax liabilities and recoverable tax assets 
if new information becomes available  adjustments will be charged against income at that time 
we do not anticipate that such adjustments would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity  however  it is possible that the final outcomes could have a material impact on our reported results of operations 
results of operations our results of operations are affected by our recent acquisitions and divestitures 
we acquired core metals in april accordingly  our results for the year ended june  include the results of core metals for the entire period 
results for the year ended june  include the results of core metals for three months 
we sold the manufacturing operations of globe metais in november  but continued to sell a portion of the silicon metal produced by globe metais to fulfill commitments to customers of globe metais that we retained until december  gsm fiscal year ended june  vs

the increase in metric tons sold resulted in an increase in net sales of  silicon metal volume sold was higher due to increased demand  which led us to reopen our niagara falls  new york facility in november  which contributed approximately  incremental metric tons  and our selma  alabama facility in january  which contributed approximately  incremental metric tons sold during fiscal year these increases were offset by the decrease in volume due to the timing of the sale of our brazilian manufacturing operations on november  subsequent to this divestiture  remaining globe metais sales related only to the fulfillment of certain retained customer contracts with product purchased from our former brazilian manufacturing operations at a purchase price equal to our sales price 
these customer contracts were fulfilled at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year  and no further sales will be made under this arrangement 
the increase in volume includes the impact of the core metals acquisition  which contributed approximately  incremental metric tons in fiscal year versus fiscal year additionally  end market demand for ferrosilicon and magnesium ferrosilicon increased in fiscal year due to the economic recovery  particularly in steel and automotive production 
the increase in average selling price of resulted in increased net sales of approximately  the increase in pricing was primarily due to higher pricing of the annual calendar contracts and higher spot pricing 
the increase in pricing was also due to improved demand from the economic recovery  offset by the impact of the acquisition of core metals in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  which resulted in a mix shift towards the production of ferrosilicon 
ferrosilicon is our lowest priced alloy and also has the lowest cost of production 
other revenue increased by  as a result of  of incremental other sales from core metals during fiscal year and the recognition of  in previously deferred revenue from solsil as the technology license  joint development and supply agreement with bp solar international inc bp solar was terminated in the second quarter of fiscal year cost of goods sold the  or  increase in cost of goods sold was a result of a increase in metric tons sold  as well as a increase in our cost per ton sold 
this increase in cost per ton sold was primarily due to the impact of planned furnace maintenance outages at gmi and core metals  higher power rates at globe metales and gmi  and  of expense related to satisfaction of the long term supply contract in fiscal year these cost increases were partially offset by the impact of reduced start up costs of approximately  at our niagara falls and selma plants in the year over year period  the mix shift to ferrosilicon  which has our lowest cost of production  and the timing of the sale of our brazilian manufacturing operations on november  gross margin represented approximately of net sales in fiscal year and increased from of net sales in fiscal year  primarily as a result of higher silicon metal and silicon based alloy selling prices  partially offset by higher power costs at globe metales and gmi  as well as the impact of reduced margins on the sale of product purchased from our former brazilian manufacturing operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of  or  was primarily a result of the impact of the acquisition of core metals  which incrementally increased expense by  and an increase in due diligence and transaction related costs and audit and other professional fees  including sarbanes oxley act compliance related expenditures  of approximately  and  respectively  at corporate 
additionally  bonus expense at corporate increased approximately  due to profitability improvement year over year 
these cost increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately  at globe metais due to the timing of the sale of our brazilian manufacturing operations 
loss gain on sale of business loss gain on sale of business for fiscal year was associated with the sale of our brazilian manufacturing operations on november  a subsequent settlement associated with our brazilian manufacturing operations was recorded in fiscal year net interest expense net interest expense decreased by  primarily due to lower interest rate swap expense of approximately  at gmi  as well as the timing of the sale of our brazilian manufacturing operations on november   which resulted in a reduction in net interest expense of  other income other income decreased by  due primarily to a foreign exchange gain of  at globe metais in fiscal year the foreign exchange gain at globe metais consisted of foreign exchange gains of  primarily associated with the revaluation of long term reais denominated tax liabilities  and a gain of  on our foreign exchange forward contracts 
these foreign exchange fluctuations no longer occur following the sale of our brazilian manufacturing operations on november  provision for income taxes provision for income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income was approximately  or  in fiscal year and was approximately  or  in fiscal year the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the benefit associated with the recording of certain state tax credits partially offset by the recognition of  in income tax expense associated with the sale of our brazilian manufacturing operations in fiscal year segment operations gmi years ended june  increase percentage decrease change dollars in thousands results of operations net sales cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring charges na operating income net sales increased  or  from the prior year to  the increase was primarily attributable to a increase in metric tons sold

as a result of the acquisition of core metals in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  there was a product mix shift towards ferrosilicon  which is our lowest priced alloy and also has the lowest cost of production 
this impact was offset by higher pricing on ferrosilicon and magnesium ferrosilicon products due to increased market demand 
the gmi segment includes the alloy joint venture  which was entered into on november   and sells of the output of the alloy plant to dow corning corporation dow corning at cost 
we control the joint venture and consolidate its results in our financial statements 
as a result of the joint venture  gmi s gross margin has been negatively impacted by virtue of the material sold to dow corning at cost 
the increase in pricing for silicon metal during fiscal year more than offset this impact and resulted in increased gross margin year over year 
operating income increased by  from the prior year to  this increase was primarily due to higher volumes shipped of silicon based alloys and silicon metal and higher average selling prices for silicon metal 
cost of goods sold increased by  while volumes increased by only 
this was a result of an increase in the cost per ton sold due to the impact of planned furnace maintenance outages  higher power rates  and  of expense related to satisfaction of the long term supply contract in fiscal year  offset by the impact of reduced start up costs of approximately  at our niagara falls and selma plants in the year over year period

the increase in metric tons sold resulted in an increase in net sales of  volume sold was higher due to the reopening of our niagara falls  new york facility in november  which provided approximately an additional  metric tons  offset by a decrease in production volumes in selma  alabama of approximately  metric tons due to plant closure from april to january the increase in volume includes the impact of the core metals acquisition  which contributed approximately  metric tons in fiscal year additionally  end market demand for magnesium ferrosilicon increased in the second half of fiscal year due to the economic recovery  particularly in automotive production 
the decline in average selling price of resulted in decreased net sales of approximately  the decline in pricing was due to a significant reduction in steel production in the first half of fiscal year  driven by lower automobile production and construction spending 
this resulted in an overall reduction in customer demand  which caused us to reduce pricing to retain volume and also caused a mix shift towards the production of ferrosilicon  which is our lowest priced alloy and also has the lowest cost of production 
additionally  the acquisition of core metals in the fourth quarter of fiscal year caused a further mix shift within silicon based alloys to ferrosilicon 
the decrease in pricing was also due to the impact of shipping of the alloy joint venture output at cost to dow corning  offset by favorable annual contracts and higher spot pricing in the quarter ended june  silica fume and other revenue increased by  as a result of  of other sales from core metals in fiscal year  offset by a decline of  in yonvey s electrode sales to third parties  and lower production levels and sales of other by products 
cost of goods sold the  or  increase in cost of goods sold was a result of a increase in metric tons sold  offset by a decline in cost per ton sold 
this decline in cost per ton sold was the result of several factors  including the curtailment of solsil production  which lowered cost of goods sold by  and metric tons sold by approximately  a mix shift within silicon based alloys to lower cost ferrosilicon  which reduced cost of goods sold by approximately  and our overall cost reduction programs 
these cost decreases were partially offset by lower capacity utilization during fiscal year and start up costs totaling approximately  primarily at our niagara falls and selma plants 
gross margin represented approximately of net sales in fiscal year and decreased to approximately of net sales in fiscal year  primarily as a result of the start up costs for our niagara falls and selma plants  the impact of selling of the alloy joint venture output at cost to dow corning  and the lower silicon based alloy average selling price 
selling  general and administrative expenses the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses of  or  was largely due to the write off of  of deferred offering costs in the second quarter of fiscal year  caused by a more than day delay in our initial public offering  a decrease of  and  in audit and other professional fees at corporate and yonvey  respectively  a decrease of  of wages  insurance and general expense at yonvey through aggressive cost cutting measures  a decrease of  primarily in salaries and wages at solsil due to the suspension of commercial production  and a decrease of approximately  at globe metais  of which  was due to the timing of the sale of our brazilian manufacturing operations  and the balance was due to aggressive cost reduction measures 
these decreases were offset by an increase in salaries and benefits of  at gmi with the restart of the niagara falls plant  higher due diligence costs of  and the impact of the acquisition of core metals  which increased expense by research and development the decrease in research and development expenses of  was primarily due to the suspension of production and related activities at solsil  which resulted in a decrease of  gain on sale of business gain on sale of business recorded in fiscal year is associated with the sale of our brazilian manufacturing operations on november  for gross cash proceeds of approximately  less transaction expenses and the recording of certain retained liabilities 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment goodwill and intangible asset impairment recorded in fiscal year was approximately  and was associated with the solsil business unit 
the global economic slowdown  combined with a decrease in oil prices  caused a sharp decline in the product price and demand for upgraded metallurgical grade silicon 
as a result  it was determined that the value of the solsil business unit no longer supported its goodwill and intangible asset balances 
net interest expense net interest expense decreased by  due to the refinancing and repayment of credit facilities at gmi  yonvey  and globe metales  which resulted in lower average debt balances and interest rates  and the timing of the sale of our brazilian manufacturing operations on november  other income other income decreased by  due primarily to a one time gain at gmi of  due to the settlement of litigation in fiscal year  a year over year decrease of  of other income related to royalties associated with the lease of certain property at gmi  and a year over year decrease of  of dividend income to globe metales from hydroelectric plant ownership interests  offset by a year over year foreign exchange gain of  driven primarily by fluctuations of the brazilian real against the us dollar prior to our sale of globe metais manufacturing operations 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal years and was and  respectively 
our tax rate is affected by recurring items  such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income we earn in each jurisdiction 
it is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year  but are not consistent from year to year 
the change in our tax provision was primarily due to the fact that the prior year goodwill impairment charge arose from a non taxable acquisition and no tax benefit was obtained from the goodwill impairment 
in addition  the change in the level of earnings and losses within the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate also impacted the effective tax rate 
the increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by the benefit associated with the recording of certain state tax credits and adjustments in fiscal year segment operations gmi years ended june  increase percentage decrease change dollars in thousands results of operations net sales cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring charges operating income net sales increased  or  from the prior year to  the increase was primarily attributable to a increase in metric tons sold 
volume was higher primarily due to the impact of the reopening of our niagara falls facility in november  which provided approximately an additional  metric tons  offset by a decrease in production volumes in selma of approximately  metric tons due to plant closure from april to january volume was also higher due to an increase in end market demand  primarily from the automotive industry  for magnesium ferrosilicon in the second half of fiscal year the increase in volume included the impact of the core metals acquisition  which contributed approximately  metric tons in fiscal year pricing was down due to a product mix shift towards ferrosilicon coupled with reduced ferrosilicon pricing  which was the result of reduced demand and aggressive foreign imports  offset by favorable annual contracts and improving spot market prices for certain products in the second half of fiscal year additionally  the acquisition of core metals in the fourth quarter of fiscal year caused a further mix shift to ferrosilicon 
the gmi segment includes the alloy joint venture  which was entered into on november   and sells of the output of the alloy plant to dow corning at cost 
we control the joint venture and consolidate its results in our financial statements 
as a result of the joint venture  gmi s gross margin has been reduced by virtue of the material sold to dow corning at cost 
operating income decreased by  from the prior year to  this was primarily due to increased production costs and lower average selling prices 
cost of goods sold increased by while volumes increased by only 
this caused an increase in the cost per ton sold  which reflects our reduced capacity utilization  and start up costs of approximately  at our niagara falls and selma plants 
the addition of core metals contributed  to selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year  and the reopening of the niagara falls plant was a major driver of the  increase in salaries and benefits at gmi 
globe metais years ended june  increase percentage decrease change dollars in thousands results of operations net sales cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative expenses research and development restructuring charges na gain on sale of business na operating income net sales decreased  or  from the prior year to  the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in metric tons sold and a decrease in the sale of by products of  the decrease in volume was due to the timing of the sale of our brazilian manufacturing operations on november  and the global economic recession  which caused a pronounced decline in domestic brazilian demand and european demand from producers of silicones and aluminum 
after the sale of our brazilian manufacturing operations  globe metais no longer produces or sells by products 
operating income decreased by  or  from the prior year to  the decrease was primarily due to the timing of the sale of our brazilian manufacturing operations  which led to lower sales volumes 
results also included transaction costs associated with the sale of  cost of goods sold decreased while volumes decreased  which caused an increase in the cost per metric ton sold 
this increase was due to lower capacity utilization and increased production costs associated with the appreciation of the brazilian real  which was offset by gains on our foreign exchange forward contract  which are recorded in other income 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by  due to the timing of the sale of our brazilian manufacturing operations on november   which resulted in a cost reduction of approximately  and the balance was due to aggressive cost reduction measures 
the gain on sale of business reflects only transaction costs of  associated with the sale of our brazilian manufacturing operations  as the gain on the sale of the manufacturing operations is reported in the corporate operating segment 
globe metales years ended june  increase percentage decrease change dollars in thousands results of operations net sales cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring charges na operating income net sales decreased  or  from the prior year to  the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in average selling price  partially offset by a increase in metric tons sold 
pricing decreased due to the completion of certain favorable long term contracts  a change in product mix  which included the sale of lower priced ferrosilicon  the market price of which was affected by a reduction in global steel production 
volumes increased primarily due to the re entry of globe metales into the lower priced ferrosilicon market 
operating income decreased by  from the prior year to  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in average selling prices offset by higher volumes and lower production costs 
average selling prices decreased by while cost per ton decreased by only  partially as a result of the expiration of a long term  low priced power contract 
the reduced gross margin and operating income resulted primarily from the change in product mix  which included the production of lower priced ferrosilicon  partially offset by our aggressive cost reduction initiatives 
solsil years ended june  increase percentage decrease change dollars in thousands results of operations net sales cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative expenses research and development restructuring charges na goodwill and intangible asset impairment na operating loss net sales decreased  from the prior year to  the decrease was primarily attributable to solsil suspending commercial production as a result of a significant decline in the price of polysilicon and the decline in demand for upgraded metallurgical grade silicon 
as a result  we are concentrating our efforts on research and development activities focused on reducing our cost of production 
cost of goods sold decreased  from the prior year to  cost of goods sold was  in excess of sales in  reflecting solsil s additional investment to refine its production processes 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  and research and development expenses decreased  as a result of suspended production and the focus on enhancing production yields and lowering the cost of production 
solsil recorded a goodwill and intangible asset impairment in the second quarter of fiscal year of  the global economic slowdown  combined with the decrease in oil prices  caused a sharp decline in the product price and demand for upgraded metallurgical grade silicon 
as a result  it was determined that the value of the solsil business no longer supported its goodwill and intangible asset balances 
corporate years ended june  increase percentage decrease change dollars in thousands results of operations selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring charges na gain on sale of business na operating income loss operating income loss increased by  from the prior year to  the increase was primarily due to the  gain on the sale of business recorded in fiscal year  which was associated with the sale of our brazilian manufacturing operations on november  for gross cash proceeds of approximately  less transaction expenses and the recording of certain retained liabilities 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  or  from the prior year to  this was primarily due to the write off of  of deferred offering costs in the second quarter of fiscal year because our initial public offering was postponed by more than days and a decrease of  in audit and other professional fees

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in commodity prices  interest rates  and foreign exchange rates 
in the normal course of business  we manage these risks through a variety of strategies  including obtaining captive or long term contracted raw material supplies and hedging strategies 
obtaining captive or long term contracted raw material supplies involves the acquisition of companies or assets for the purpose of increasing our access to raw materials or the identification and effective implementation of long term leasing rights or supply agreements 
we enter into derivative instruments to hedge certain commodity price  interest rate  and foreign currency risks 
we do not engage in commodity  interest rate  or currency speculation  and no derivatives are held for trading purposes 
all derivatives are accounted for using mark to market accounting 
we believe it is not practical to designate our derivative instruments as hedging instruments as defined under asc subtopic  derivatives and hedging asc 
accordingly  we adjust our derivative financial instruments to current market value through the consolidated statement of operations based on the fair value of the agreement as of period end 
although not designated as hedged items as defined under asc  these derivative instruments serve to significantly offset our commodity  interest rate  and currency risks 
gains or losses from these transactions offset gains or losses on the assets  liabilities  or transactions being hedged 
no credit loss is anticipated as the counterparties to our derivative agreements are major financial institutions that are highly rated 
the sensitivity of our derivatives to these market fluctuations is discussed below 
see our june  consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivatives and our hedging policies 
commodity prices we are exposed to price risk for certain raw materials and energy used in our production process 
the raw materials and energy which we use are largely commodities  subject to price volatility caused by changes in global supply and demand and governmental controls 
derivative financial instruments are not used extensively to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the cost of commodity products used in our operations 
we attempt to reduce the impact of increases in our raw material and energy costs by negotiating long term contracts and through the acquisition of companies or assets for the purpose of increasing our access to raw materials with favorable pricing terms 
we have entered into long term power supply contracts that result in stable  favorably priced long term commitments for the majority of our power needs 
additionally  we have long term lease mining rights in the us that supply us with a substantial portion of our requirements for quartzite 
we also have obtained a captive supply of electrodes through our ownership interest in yonvey 
in june  we entered into a power hedge agreement on a  mwh notional amount of electricity  representing approximately of the total power required by our niagara falls  new york plant 
this hedge covers our expected needs not supplied by the facility s long term power contract over the term of the hedge agreement 
the notional amount decreases equally per month through the agreement s expiration on june  under the power hedge agreement  we fixed the power rate at per mwh over the life of the contract 
in october  we entered into a power hedge agreement on a  mwh notional amount of electricity 
the agreement is effective july  and the notional amount decreases equally per month through the agreement s expiration on june  under the power hedge agreement  we fixed the power rate at per mwh over the life of the contract 
the  liability associated with the fair value of our power hedge agreements at june  is included in other long term liabilities 
to the extent that we have not mitigated our exposure to rising raw material and energy prices  we may not be able to increase our prices to our customers to offset such potential raw material or energy price increases  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and operating cash flows 
interest rates we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on certain of our short term and long term debt obligations 
at june   we had approximately  of variable rate debt 
to manage our interest rate risk exposure we have entered into an interest rate cap and interest rate swap agreements with investment grade financial institutions 
in connection with our revolving credit facility and senior term loan  we entered into an interest rate cap arrangement and three interest rate swap agreements to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
in october  we entered into an interest rate cap arrangement to cap libor on a  notional amount of debt  with the notional amount decreasing by  per quarter through the interest rate cap s expiration on june  under the interest rate cap  we capped libor at a maximum of over the life of the agreement 
in november  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement involving the exchange of interest obligations relating to a  notional amount of debt  with the notional amount decreasing by  per quarter 
under the interest rate swap  we receive libor in exchange for a fixed interest rate of over the life of the agreement 
the agreement expires in june in january  we entered into a second interest rate swap agreement involving the exchange of interest obligations relating to a  notional amount of debt  with the notional amount decreasing by  per quarter 
under the interest rate swap  we receive libor in exchange for a fixed interest rate of over the life of the agreement 
the agreement expires in june in april  we entered into a third interest rate swap agreement involving the exchange of interest obligations relating to an  notional amount of debt  with the notional amount decreasing by  per quarter 
under the interest rate swap  we receive libor in exchange for a fixed interest rate of over the life of the agreement 
the agreement expires in june in connection with our export prepayment financing arrangement  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement involving the exchange of interest obligations relating to a  notional amount of debt  with the notional amount decreasing by  on a semiannual basis through august  and a final  notional amount swapped for the six month period ended january under the interest rate swap  we received libor in exchange for a fixed interest rate of over the life of the agreement 
this agreement  as well as the related export prepayment financing arrangement  was transferred with the sale of the manufacturing operations of globe metais 
the  liability associated with the fair value of our interest rate derivative instruments at june  is included in other long term liabilities 
if market interest rates were to increase or decrease by for the full fiscal year as compared to the rates in effect at june   we estimate that the change would not have a material impact to our cash flows or results of operations 
foreign currency risk we are exposed to market risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates as a result of operations outside the united states  principally in argentina and china 
a portion of our net sales generated from our non us operations is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
most of our operating costs for our us operations are denominated in local currencies  principally the argentine peso and the chinese renminbi 
consequently  the translated us dollar value of our non us dollar sales  and related accounts receivable balances  and our operating costs are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
derivative instruments are not used extensively to manage this risk 
we have utilized derivative financial instruments  including foreign exchange forward contracts  to manage a portion of our net foreign currency exposure to the brazilian real and the euro 
all of the brazilian real contracts were settled prior to the sale of the manufacturing operations of globe metais 
if foreign exchange rates were to increase or decrease by for the full fiscal year  as compared to the rates in effect at june   we estimate that the change would not have a material impact to our cash flows or results of operations
