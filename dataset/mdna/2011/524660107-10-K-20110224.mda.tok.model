risk factors 
investing in our securities involves risk 
set forth below and elsewhere in this report are risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
we may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time by other reports we file with the sec 
we have exposure to economic and other factors that affect market demand for our products 
as a supplier of products to a variety of industries  we are adversely affected by general economic downturns 
our operating performance is heavily influenced by market demand for our components and products 
market demand for the majority of our products is most heavily influenced by consumer confidence 
to a lesser extent  market demand is impacted by other broad economic factors  including disposable income levels  employment levels  housing turnover  energy costs and interest rates 
all of these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods  and drive demand for our products 
some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment  which impacts approximately one quarter of our sales 
demand weakness in our markets can lead to lower unit orders  sales and earnings in our businesses 
several factors  including a weak global economy  a depressed housing market  or low consumer confidence could contribute to conservative spending habits by consumers around the world 
short lead times in most of our markets allow for limited visibility into demand trends 
if economic and market conditions deteriorate  we may experience material negative impacts on our business  financial condition  operating cash flows and results of operations 
deteriorating financial condition of our customers could negatively affect our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
we serve customers in a variety of industries  some of which have and are continuing to experience low levels of demand due to a weak global economy 
a sustained economic downturn increases the possibility that one or more of our significant customers  or a group of less significant customers  could become insolvent  which could adversely impact our sales  net earnings  financial condition  cash flow and liquidity 

table of contents part i costs of raw materials could negatively affect our operating results 
raw material cost increases and our ability to respond to cost increases through selling price increases can significantly impact our earnings 
we typically have short term commitments from our suppliers  therefore  our raw material costs move with the market 
when we experience significant increases in raw material costs  we implement price increases to recover the higher costs 
inability to recover cost increases or a delay in the recovery time can negatively impact our earnings 
also  if raw material costs decrease  we generally pass through reduced selling prices to our customers 
reduced selling prices tied to higher cost inventory reduces our segment margins and earnings 
steel is our most significant raw material 
the global steel markets are cyclical in nature and have been volatile in recent years 
this volatility can result in large swings in pricing and margins from year to year 
our operations can also be impacted by changes in the cost of fabrics and foam scrap 
we experienced significant fluctuations in the cost of these commodities in recent years 
higher raw material costs in recent years led some of our customers to modify their product designs  changing the quantity and mix of our components in their finished goods 
in some cases  higher cost components were replaced with lower cost components 
this has primarily impacted our residential furnishings and industrial materials product mix and decreased profit margins 
this trend could further negatively impact our results of operations 
we may not be able to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet depending upon the amount and source of future taxable income 
our ability to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet is dependent upon the amount and source of future taxable income 
economic uncertainty or tax law changes could change our underlying assumptions on which valuation reserves are established and negatively affect future period earnings and balance sheets 
asian and european competition could adversely affect our operating results 
we operate in markets that are highly competitive 
we believe that most companies in our lines of business compete primarily on price  but  depending upon the particular product  we experience competition based on quality  performance and availability as well 
we face ongoing pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products from asia and europe 
if we are unable to purchase key raw materials  such as steel  at prices competitive with those of foreign suppliers  our ability to maintain market share and profit margins could be harmed 
our goodwill and other long lived assets are subject to potential impairment 
a significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long lived assets  the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired 
at december   goodwill and other intangible assets represented approximately billion  or approximately of our total assets 
in addition  net property  plant and equipment  sundry assets and non current assets held for sale totaled approximately million  or approximately of total assets 

table of contents part i we review our ten reporting units for potential goodwill impairment in june as part of our annual goodwill impairment testing  and more often if an event or circumstance occurs making it likely that impairment exists 
in addition  we test for the recoverability of long lived assets at year end  and more often if an event or circumstance indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as future expectations 
the annual goodwill impairment review performed in june indicated no goodwill impairments 
at december   goodwill associated with reporting units whose fair values exceeded the carrying value by was approximately million  and million of goodwill was associated with reporting units that had fair values in excess of the carrying values by greater than 
for the year ended  other long lived asset impairments were million  of which million was recognized in continuing operations 
if actual results differ from the assumptions and estimates used in the goodwill and long lived asset calculations  we could incur impairment charges  which could negatively impact our results of operations 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total sales  which exposes us to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
in  of our sales from continuing operations were generated by international operations 
the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies  however  certain of our operations experience currency related gains and losses where sales or purchases are denominated in currencies other than their local currency 
further  our competitive position may be affected by the relative strength of the currencies in countries where our products are sold 
foreign currency exchange risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries may have a material adverse effect on our future operations and financial results

in the opinion of management the company s owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate for the manufacture  assembly and distribution of our products 
our properties are located to allow quick and efficient delivery of products and services to our diverse customer base 
our productive capacity  in general  continues to exceed current operating levels 
we face decisions about further facility consolidation but have chosen to retain excess capacity because we believe that eventually market demand will improve 
with our currently low utilization levels  we should be able to readily accommodate that demand improvement up to approximately billion in revenue assuming current sales mix

table of contents part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
highlights demand improved in many of our markets during the automotive and office furniture markets experienced significant improvement from very depressed demand levels in retail fixturing demand was also reasonably strong 
our residential bedding and furniture markets started strong but weakened in the last half of the year as consumer spending on larger ticket items slowed 
improved market demand led to higher sales and earnings in activities completed over the past few years including the divestiture of businesses under our strategic plan  closure of certain underperforming and underutilized facilities  elimination of sales with unacceptable margins  and other cost reduction initiatives improved our cost position and enabled earnings to benefit notably from the higher volume 
during  we completed the sale of the seventh  and final divestiture identified as a part of our strategic realignment 
the seven divestitures collectively generated million of after tax cash proceeds over the past three years  exceeding our original million goal 
operating cash for the full year significantly exceeded the amount required to fund capital expenditures and dividends 
our focus on return optimization was reflected in part through the low level of working capital that was maintained as sales began to recover 
in august  we raised the quarterly dividend to 
per share and extended to years our record of consecutive annual dividend increases at a compound annual growth rate 
we also repurchased over million shares of our stock during our financial profile remains strong 
we ended with net debt to net capital well below our long term targeted range  no significant fixed term debt maturing until  and over million available under our existing commercial paper program and revolver facility 
we assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return tsr  on a rolling three year basis  to that of peer companies 
we target tsr in the top one third of the s p over the long term  which we believe will require average tsr of per year 
for the three years ended december   we generated tsr of per year on average  which places us in the top of the s p these topics are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow 

table of contents part ii introduction what we do leggett platt is a diversified manufacturer  and member of the s p index  that conceives  designs  and produces a wide range of engineered components and products found in most homes  offices  and automobiles  and many retail stores 
we make components that are often hidden within  but integral to  our customers products 
we are the leading us manufacturer of components for residential furniture and bedding  power foundations  carpet underlay  components for office furniture  drawn steel wire  automotive seat support and lumbar systems  and bedding industry machinery 
our segments our continuing operations are composed of business units in four segments  with approximately  employees and production facilities located in countries around the world 
our segments are described below 
logo residential furnishings this segment supplies a variety of components mainly used by bedding and upholstered furniture manufacturers in the assembly of their finished products 
we also sell carpet cushion  power foundations  bed frames  ornamental beds  and geo components 
commercial fixturing components operations in this segment manufacture and sell store fixtures and point of purchase displays used in retail stores 
we also produce chair controls  bases  and other components for office furniture manufacturers  as well as select lines of private label finished furniture 

table of contents part ii industrial materials these operations primarily supply steel rod  drawn steel wire  steel billets  and welded steel tubing to other leggett operations and to external customers 
our customers use this wire and tubing to make bedding  furniture  automotive seats  mechanical springs  and many other end products 
we also supply fabricated wire products  such as shaped wire for automotive and medical supply application  tying heads  boxed wire  and parts for automatic baling equipment  coated wire products  including dishwasher racks  and wire retail fixtures and point of purchase displays 
specialized products from this segment we supply lumbar support systems and seat suspension systems used by automotive seating manufacturers 
we manufacture and install the racks  shelving and cabinets used to outfit fleets of service vans 
we also produce quilting  sewing  and wire forming machinery  some of which is used by other leggett operations as well as external customers  including bedding manufacturers 
discontinued operations and divestitures during the past three years  we divested seven businesses approximately of our portfolio that we identified as a part of the strategic realignment announced in late discussed below 
in  we sold our aluminum products segment and four smaller business units wood products  fibers  plastics  and the dealer portion of commercial vehicle products 
in  we sold the coated fabrics business unit  and in we divested the storage products business unit 
we received after tax cash proceeds of million for these seven businesses  exceeding our original estimate of approximately million 
results of operations for all of these businesses are classified as discontinued operations in our financial statements 
for more information about discontinued operations and the divestitures  see note b to the consolidated financial statements on page strategic direction in late  we outlined significant changes to the company s strategy 
we adopted a new primary financial metric total shareholder return  adopted role based portfolio management  implemented more rigorous strategic planning  and changed the priorities for use of cash 
our goals  in sequential order  were to i divest low performing businesses  ii return more cash to investors  iii improve margins and returns  and iv begin to carefully and conservatively grow the company at of annual revenue 
we have made significant progress over the past three years 
the divestitures were largely complete by the end of  margins and returns have improved  and we have returned much of our excess cash to our shareholders through higher dividends and share repurchases 
our focus now is two part i continue improving margins  and ii begin laying the groundwork for long term growth 
total shareholder return tsr is the key financial measure that we use to monitor performance 
tsr is driven by the change in our share price and the dividends we pay 
tsr change in stock price dividends beginning stock price 
we seek to achieve tsr in the top one third of the s p over the long term through a balanced approach 
table of contents part ii that employs all four tsr sources revenue growth  margin expansion  dividends  and share repurchases 
in  dividends and stock buybacks largely drove our tsr  during  we benefited significantly from margin improvement  and in  revenue growth from improved market demand boosted tsr 
beginning in  we introduced tsr based incentives based on our performance compared to the performance of a group of peers for senior executives and we modified business unit bonuses to give more importance to achieving higher returns on the assets under their direct control 
we monitor our tsr performance  relative to the s p  on a rolling three year basis 
for the three year period ended december   our tsr performance placed us within the top of the s p companies 
so far  for the first two years of the next three year measurement period which will end on december   our tsr performance ranks slightly above the midpoint but not among the top one third of the companies in the s p we utilize a rigorous strategic planning process to help guide future decisions regarding business unit roles  capital allocation priorities  and new areas in which to grow 
we review the portfolio classification of each unit on an annual basis to determine its appropriate role grow  core  fix  or divest 
this review includes criteria such as competitive position  market attractiveness  business unit size  and fit within our overall objectives  as well as financial indicators such as ebitda growth  operating cash flows  and return on assets 
to remain in the portfolio  business units are expected to consistently generate after tax returns in excess of our cost of capital 
business units that fail to consistently attain minimum return goals will be moved to the fix or divest categories 
the majority of our business units are categorized as core 
a smaller percentage are categorized as grow  consequently  we recognize as a strategic imperative the need to expand the grow category by improving i our success rate at developing innovative new products and ii our abilities to identify new growth platforms 
a few small business units are considered fix  and must improve their performance within a reasonable time frame 
finally  a few small business units or portions of business units are considered non strategic  and may be divested as the m a market recovers and allows for reasonable sales prices 
long term  we aim to eventually achieve consistent  profitable growth of annually 
to attain this goal  we will need to supplement the approximate growth that our markets typically produce in normal economic times with two additional areas of opportunity 
first  we must enhance our success rate at developing and commercializing innovative new products within markets in which we already enjoy strong competitive positions 
second  we need to uncover new growth platforms  opportunities in markets new to us  and in which leggett would possess a competitive advantage 
these growth efforts are receiving significant management attention and priority  and we are making progress in both areas 
we have had success this past year  with new products introduced in our office components  automotive  and home furniture components businesses 
though individually those were modest successes  collectively they added to s sales and earnings growth 
in addition  we have instituted some of the processes that need to be in place to identify new market opportunities 
successful development of new growth platforms will take time  we do not anticipate significant contributions from these activities in the near term 
the strategic changes have increased available cash 
we expect to continue returning much of this cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases 

table of contents part ii customers we serve a broad suite of customers  with our largest customer representing of our sales 
many are companies whose names are widely recognized  they include most manufacturers of furniture and bedding  a variety of other manufacturers  and many major retailers 
major factors that impact our business many factors impact our business  but those that generally have the greatest impact are market demand  raw material cost trends  and competition 
market demand market demand including product mix is impacted by several economic factors  with consumer confidence being most significant 
other important factors include disposable income levels  employment levels  housing turnover  and interest rates 
all these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods  and therefore affect demand for our components and products 
some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment  which impacts approximately one quarter of our sales 
demand improved in many of our markets during the automotive and office furniture markets experienced significant improvement from very depressed demand levels in retail fixturing demand was also reasonably strong 
our residential bedding and furniture markets started strong but weakened in the last half of the year as consumer spending on larger ticket items slowed 
improved market demand led to higher sales and earnings in activities completed over the past few years including the divestiture of businesses under our strategic plan  closure of certain underperforming and underutilized facilities  elimination of sales with unacceptable margins  and other cost reduction initiatives improved our cost position and enabled earnings to benefit notably from higher sales 
capacity utilization levels in the majority of our operations remain low 
we face decisions about possible further facility consolidation but have chosen to retain excess capacity because we believe that market demand will continue to improve 
our current productive capacity should readily accommodate sales of approximately billion assuming current sales mix  or levels roughly higher than those of until our productive capacity is fully utilized  each additional million of sales from incremental unit volume should generate approximately million to million of additional pre tax earnings 
raw material costs in many of our businesses  we enjoy a cost advantage from buying large quantities of raw materials 
this purchasing leverage is a benefit that many of our competitors generally do not have 
still  our costs can vary significantly as market prices for raw materials many of which are commodities fluctuate 
purchasing arrangements vary across the company 
we typically have short term commitments from our suppliers  accordingly  our raw material costs generally move with the market 
in certain of our businesses  we have longer term purchase contracts with 
table of contents part ii pricing terms that provide stability under reasonable market conditions 
however  when commodities experience extreme inflation  vendors do not always honor those contracts 
our ability to recover higher costs through selling price increases is crucial 
when we experience significant increases in raw material costs  we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs 
conversely  when costs decrease significantly  we generally pass those lower costs through to our customers 
the timing of our price increases or decreases is important  we typically experience a lag in recovering higher costs  so we also expect to realize a lag as costs decline 
steel is our principal raw material and at various times in past years we have experienced extreme cost fluctuations in this commodity 
in most cases  the major changes both increases and decreases were passed through to customers with selling price adjustments 
significant steel cost increases in were followed by significant cost decreases in as global economies weakened 
in both cases  we generally adjusted pricing to our customers to reflect the changes in commodity costs 
in late and early  steel costs increased  and again we implemented price increases to recover the majority of the higher costs 
by the end of  we were facing further inflation in steel costs  and announced and began implementing additional price increases in early as a producer of steel rod  we are also impacted by volatility in metal margins the difference in the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod 
scrap costs increased in  and while market prices for steel rod also increased  those increases did not keep pace with escalating scrap costs 
as a result  metal margins within the steel industry and in our rod producing operation were lower during we anticipate further compression in these margins in early as scrap costs have increased again in recent months 
our other raw materials include woven and non woven fabrics  foam scrap  and chemicals 
we have experienced changes in the cost of these materials in recent years  and in most years  have been able to pass them through to our customers 
in late these costs increased  and in early we announced and began implementing price increases to recover the higher costs 
when we raise our prices to recover higher raw material costs  this sometimes causes customers to modify their product designs and replace higher cost components with lower cost components 
we experienced this de contenting effect in our residential furnishings and industrial materials segments in recent years 
as our customers changed the quantity and mix of components in their finished goods to address steel and chemical inflation  our profit margins were negatively impacted 
we are responding by developing new products including new types of mattress innersprings  boxsprings  and reclining chair mechanisms that enable our customers to reduce their total costs  and in certain instances  provide higher margin and profit contribution for our operations 
competition many of our markets are highly competitive with the number of competitors varying by product line 
in general  our competitors tend to be smaller  private companies 
we believe we gain competitive advantage in our global markets through low cost operations  significant internal production of key raw materials  manufacturing expertise 
table of contents part ii and product innovation  higher quality products  extensive customer service capabilities  and financial strength 
many of our competitors  both domestic and foreign  compete primarily on the basis of price 
our success has stemmed from the ability to remain price competitive  while delivering product quality  innovation  and customer service 
we continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore 
in addition to lower labor rates  foreign competitors benefit at times from lower raw material costs 
they may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates related to safety and environmental matters 
we typically remain price competitive  even versus many foreign manufacturers  as a result of our highly efficient operations  low labor content  vertical integration in steel and wire  and large scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities 
however  we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases by selectively adjusting prices  and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs 
in instances where our customers move production of their finished products overseas  our operations must be located nearby to supply them efficiently 
we currently operate facilities in china 
in late  we filed an antidumping suit related to innerspring imports from china  south africa and vietnam 
we saw a distinct decline in unfair imports during after the antidumping investigations began 
as a result  we regained market share and performance in our bedding group improved 
the investigations were brought to a favorable conclusion in early the current antidumping duty rates on innersprings from these countries are significant  ranging from to  and should remain in effect at least until early imported innersprings from these countries are now supposed to be sold at fair prices  however the duties on certain innersprings are being evaded by various means including shipping the goods through a third country and falsely identifying the country of origin 
leggett  along with several us manufacturers of products with active antidumping or antidumping countervailing duty orders  formed a coalition and are working with members of congress  the us department of commerce  and us customs and border protection to seek stronger enforcement of existing antidumping and or countervailing duty orders 
we experienced a temporary loss of market share during the last half of as certain of our customers purchased a portion of their innerspring requirements from european suppliers 
the opportunity to buy these components at a lower price resulted from a combination of factors that benefited european suppliers in the early summer i the weaker euro  ii temporarily lower wire costs  and iii greater excess capacity as a result of economic turmoil in europe 
because of the slowing of consumer demand for mattresses in the last half of  it took longer for these imported products to be consumed  but by year end  we had regained the majority of the lost volume

the automotive and office furniture markets experienced significant improvement from very depressed demand levels in retail fixturing demand was also reasonably strong 
our residential bedding and furniture markets started strong but weakened in the last half of the year as consumer spending on larger ticket items slowed 

table of contents part ii full year earnings from continuing operations increased in  primarily reflecting higher unit volumes  a lower effective tax rate  and the non recurrence of three significant expense items from detailed in the table above 
these earnings improvements were partially offset by lower metal margins 
as a producer of steel rod  we are impacted by volatility in metal margins the difference in the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod 
scrap costs increased in  and while market prices for steel rod also increased  those increases did not keep pace with escalating scrap costs 
as a result  metal margins within the steel industry and in our rod producing operation were lower during lifo impact all of our segments use the first in  first out fifo method for valuing inventory

these benefits were partially offset by incremental taxes resulting from the repatriation of certain foreign earnings 
during  we repatriated million of foreign earnings  which resulted in a net tax charge of million 
in  the higher tax rate reflected unfavorable tax adjustments resulting from mexican tax law changes  which caused us to re evaluate our deferred tax assets and liabilities in that jurisdiction 
as a result  we recorded a million tax charge to earnings related to and prior year losses that might expire before they could be utilized to reduce taxable earnings

other factors impacting the year over year earnings comparison are presented in the table above 
the divestiture note write down identified in the table occurred when we learned in that the aluminum operations divested in july needed a capital infusion from the buyer due to deterioration in business conditions 
this led to a reduction in the value of the note we accepted in as partial payment for the divesture 
leggett accepted a more subordinate position in the capital structure of the divested operations

table of contents part ii liquidity and capitalization in this section  we provide details  reflecting both continuing and discontinued operations  about our uses of cash cash from operations debt position and total capitalization we use cash for the following finance capital requirements eg productivity  growth and acquisitions pay dividends repurchase our stock our operations provide most of the cash we require  and debt may also be used to fund a portion of our needs 
in  cash proceeds from completed divestitures were an additional significant source of funds 
in  we generated our second highest level of cash from operations in our history  at million  which included a significant reduction in working capital as sales contracted 
with a slight increase in working capital in due to sales growth  operating cash was million  still readily exceeding our annual requirement for capital expenditures and dividends 
for  we expect cash flow from operations to again exceed million 
we ended with net debt to net capital of  its lowest level since and well below our long term target of 
page presents a table of the calculation of net debt as a percent of net capital at the end of the past two years 
uses of cash finance capital requirements improving returns of the existing asset base will continue to be a key focus 
however  cash is available to fund selective growth  both internally through capital expenditures and externally through acquisitions 
logo logo 
table of contents part ii capital expenditures include investments we make to maintain  modernize  and expand manufacturing capacity 
the chart above shows that capital expenditures have declined in recent years  they should approximate million in in all of our businesses  we continue to invest in the maintenance of facilities and equipment 
however  with the sales volume contraction versus levels and the resulting excess productive capacity across our operations  we have significantly reduced spending on expansion projects in recent years 
with the move to role based portfolio management  we changed our long term priorities for allocating capital and this has also impacted capital spending levels 
we are actively pursuing disciplined growth within our grow business units 
expansion capital is predominantly earmarked for these opportunities 
operations designated as core business units receive capital primarily for productivity enhancements 
we are also seeking acquisitions within our growth businesses  and are looking for opportunities to enter new  higher growth markets carefully screened for sustainable competitive advantage 
during the past few years  acquisitions were a lower priority as we were primarily focused on completing the divestitures and improving margins and returns of our existing businesses 
as a result of this temporarily lower priority  and more stringent screening criteria  no significant acquisitions were completed in   and we have recently turned our focus back toward acquisitions and have begun actively soliciting opportunities while maintaining our screening discipline 
we expect acquisitions to contribute modestly to our long term growth 
additional details about acquisitions can be found in note r to the consolidated financial statements on page pay dividends logo with continued improvement in margins and returns  a decrease in capital spending and acquisitions  and the completion of the divestitures  we expect and since have had more available cash to return to shareholders 
higher annual dividends are one means by which that should continue to occur 
in we modestly increased the quarterly dividend  to 
per share  and extended to years our record of consecutive annual dividend increases  at an average compound growth rate of 
our targeted dividend payout is approximately of net earnings  but has been higher recently and will 
table of contents part ii likely remain above targeted levels in the near term 
maintaining and increasing the dividend remains a high priority 
we anticipate spending approximately million on dividends in  roughly the same as in  with expected share repurchases offsetting expected dividend increases 
cash from operations has been  and is expected to continue to be  sufficient to readily fund both capital expenditures and dividends 
repurchase stock logo share repurchases are the other means by which we return cash to shareholders 
during the past three years  we repurchased a total of million shares of our stock and reduced outstanding shares by 
in  we repurchased over million shares at an average per share price of and issued million shares through employee benefit plans most of these shares were purchased by employees in lieu of cash compensation 
we expect to repurchase additional shares in  with the amount of purchases dependent on factors such as general economic conditions  level of demand in our end markets  and the availability of excess cash 
although no specific repurchase schedule has been established  we have been authorized by the board to repurchase up to million shares in 
table of contents part ii cash from operations cash from operations is our primary source of funds 
earnings and changes in working capital levels are the two broad factors that generally have the greatest impact on our cash from operations 
logo meaningful sales and earnings improvement contributed to our cash from operations  and was partially offset by increased working capital levels associated with those higher sales 
although working capital dollars increased  working capital as a percent of sales decreased slightly from year end levels 
cash from operations in benefitted from a million reduction in working capital during that year that occurred as a result of the economy induced sales contraction 
the following table presents key working capital measures at the end of the past two years 
amount in millions days outstanding change change accounts receivable  net inventory  net accounts payable the accounts receivable ratio represents the days of sales outstanding calculated as ending net accounts receivable net sales number of days in the year 
the inventory ratio represents days of inventory on hand calculated as ending net inventory cost of goods sold number of days in the year 
the accounts payable ratio represents the days of payables outstanding calculated as ending accounts payable cost of goods sold number of days in the year 
accounts receivable the dollar amount of accounts receivable increased from year end levels  primarily due to higher sales 
as part of our accounts receivable review process  we evaluate individual customers payment histories  financial health  industry prospects  and current macroeconomic events in 
table of contents part ii determining if outstanding amounts are collectible 
in  we incurred million of bad debt expense as compared to million in the higher expense in was primarily due to a single customer bankruptcy in the residential furnishings segment million and the write down of the aluminum segment divestiture note receivable million as discussed on page days sales outstanding dso we experienced an increase in our dso in as customers slowed payments during the economic downturn 
our dso decreased in as our markets began to improve  and we continued to focus on collection efforts to ensure customer accounts were paid on time 
we do not believe the decrease in dso indicates a significant change in credit risk or has material implications on our liquidity  but instead is caused by normal differences from year to year in the timing of sales and cash receipts 
inventory the dollar value of our inventories increased from year end levels  primarily due to inflation in raw material costs 
during  we recognized expense of million associated with obsolete and slow moving inventories  in this expense totaled million 
we do not expect significant changes in customer or industry trends that would materially increase the exposure to inventory obsolescence 
days inventory on hand dio our dio decreased compared to the prior year as our operations continue to focus on optimizing return on assets 
accounts payable the dollar value of accounts payable increased in compared to year end  primarily due to inflation in raw material costs and also from our continued efforts to optimize payment terms with our vendors 
days payable outstanding dpo our dpo has increased slightly in as we continue to work with vendors to extend our standard payment terms 
cash from operations in was strong despite weak market demand in the latter part of that year 
lower working capital versus the prior year contributed favorably to operating cash 
fourth quarter production cuts led to lower inventory levels compared to year end 
accounts receivable also declined primarily due to extremely weak sales late in that year 
working capital levels vary by segment 
the commercial fixturing components segment typically has relatively higher accounts receivable balances due to the longer credit terms required to service certain customers of the fixture display group 
this business group also generally requires higher inventory investments due to the custom nature of its products  longer manufacturing lead times in certain cases  and the needs of many customers to receive large volumes of product within short periods of time 

table of contents part ii capitalization this table presents key debt and capitalization statistics at the end of the three most recent years 
dollar amounts in millions long term debt outstanding scheduled maturities average interest rates average maturities in years revolving credit commercial paper total long term debt deferred income taxes and other liabilities equity total capitalization unused committed credit long term short term total unused committed credit current maturities of long term debt cash and cash equivalents ratio of earnings to fixed charges x x x these calculations include current maturities  but exclude commercial paper to reflect the averages of outstanding debt with scheduled maturities 
fixed charges include interest expense  capitalized interest  plus implied interest included in operating leases 
earnings consist principally of income from continuing operations before income taxes  plus fixed charges 
the next table shows the percent of long term debt to total capitalization at december  and  calculated in two ways long term debt to total capitalization as reported in the previous table 
long term debt to total capitalization each reduced by total cash and increased by current maturities of long term debt 

table of contents part ii we believe that adjusting this measure for cash and current maturities allows a more meaningful comparison to periods during which cash fluctuates significantly 
we use these adjusted measures to monitor our financial leverage 
dollar amounts in millions long term debt current debt maturities cash and cash equivalents net debt total capitalization current debt maturities cash and cash equivalents net capitalization long term debt to total capitalization net debt to net capitalization total debt which includes long term debt and current debt maturities decreased million in during the year  we reduced our commercial paper borrowings by million and paid off million of other long term debt that came due 
in anticipation of long term debt maturing in april  we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps in the swap contracts manage benchmark interest rate risk associated with million of future debt issuance  and mature in august the swaps have a weighted average interest rate of and hedge the benchmark rate of the future issuance of million of debt 
the credit spread over the benchmark bonds will continue to fluctuate until the contracts are settled either upon an issuance of debt or upon their expiration 
for more information on our interest rate swaps  see note s to the consolidated financial statements on page short term borrowings we can raise cash by issuing up to million in commercial paper through a program that is backed by a million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders that terminates in the credit agreement allows us to issue letters of credit up to million 
when we issue these letters of credit  our capacity under the agreement  and consequently  our ability to issue commercial paper  is reduced by a corresponding amount 
amounts outstanding related to our commercial paper program were dollar amounts in millions total program authorized less commercial paper outstanding classified as long term debt letters of credit issued under the credit agreement total program usage total program available 
table of contents part ii the average and maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during was million and million  respectively 
commercial paper amounts fluctuated during the year due to normal changes in working capital funding requirements 
the amounts of letters of credit outstanding throughout the year were not materially different from the amounts outstanding at year end 
based on the information currently available to us  we believe that the participating banks continue to have the ability to meet their obligations under the revolving credit agreement 
in the unlikely event that a disruption in the credit market was to become so severe that we were unable to issue commercial paper  we have the contractual right to draw funds directly on the revolving credit agreement 
in such event  the cost of borrowing under the revolving credit agreement could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowing 
we also maintain an active shelf registration 
with anticipated operating cash flows  our commercial paper program  and our expected ability to issue debt through our active shelf  we believe we have sufficient funds available to support our ongoing operations  pay dividends  repurchase stock  fund future growth  and repay maturing debt 
accessibility of cash at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million primarily invested in money market funds and interest bearing bank accounts 
a smaller portion was invested in bank time deposits with original maturities of three months or less 
a substantial portion of these funds are held in international accounts and represent undistributed earnings from our foreign operations 
the tax rules governing this area are complex 
however  subject to constantly changing facts and laws  we believe we could access a significant portion of the cash without material incremental cost 

table of contents part ii contractual obligations the following table summarizes our future contractual cash obligations and commitments payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years dollar amounts in millions long term debt capitalized leases operating leases purchase obligations interest payments deferred income taxes other obligations including pensions and reserves for tax contingencies total contractual cash obligations the long term debt payment schedule presented above could be accelerated if we were not able to make the principal and interest payments when due 
purchase obligations primarily include open short term days purchase orders that arise in the normal course of operating our facilities 
interest payments are calculated on debt outstanding at december  at rates in effect at the end of the year 

table of contents part ii critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
to do so  we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and disclosures 
if we used different estimates or judgments our financial statements would change  and some of those changes could be significant 
our estimates are frequently based upon historical experience and are considered by management  at the time they are made  to be reasonable and appropriate 
estimates are adjusted for actual events  as they occur 
critical accounting estimates are those that are a subject to uncertainty and change  and b of material impact to our financial statements 
listed below are the estimates and judgments which we believe could have the most significant effect on our financial statements 
we provide additional details regarding our significant accounting policies in note a to the consolidated financial statements on page description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions goodwill goodwill is assessed for impairment annually as of june and as triggering events occur 
in the past three years  no impairments have been recorded as a result of the annual impairment reviews 
as a result of the deterioration in the economic and financial climate in the fourth quarter  an interim goodwill impairment analysis was performed confirming that estimated fair value exceeded carrying values for all reporting units 
in order to assess goodwill for potential impairment  judgment is required to estimate the fair market value of each reporting unit which is one level below reportable segments using the combination of a discounted cash flow model and market approach using price to earnings ratios for comparable publicly traded companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit 
the cash flow model contains uncertainties related to the forecast of future results as many outside economic and competitive factors can influence future performance 
margins  sales levels  and discount rates are the most critical estimates in determining enterprise values using the cash flow model 
fair market values for two of the reporting units exceeded book value by approximately 
the goodwill associated with these reporting units is million 
both of these reporting units are dependent on business capital spending which has been substantially reduced in the recent economic downturn 
both reporting units exceeded expectations for  and are expected to show further improvement in if actual performance does not improve and remains at current levels  future goodwill impairments could be possible 
the remaining reporting units have fair market values that exceed carrying value by more than  and have goodwill of million 

table of contents part ii description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions goodwill cont 
the market approach requires judgment to determine the appropriate price to earnings ratio 
ratios are derived from comparable publicly traded companies that operate in the same or similar industry as the reporting unit 
information regarding material assumptions used to determine if a goodwill impairment exists can be found in note c on page other long lived assets other long lived assets are tested for recoverability at year end and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
for other long lived assets we estimate fair value at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured usually at a branch level 
impairments of other long lived assets usually occur when major restructuring activities take place  or we decide to discontinue product lines completely 
our impairment assessments have uncertainties because they require estimates of future cash flows to determine if undiscounted cash flows are sufficient to recover carrying values of these assets 
for assets where future cash flows are not expected to recover carrying value  fair value is estimated which requires an estimate of market value based upon asset appraisals for like assets 
these impairments are very unpredictable  and are difficult to anticipate 
impairments were million in  million in  and million in we believe that future restructuring and shut down activities should be equal to or less than those in however this could change if certain product lines or businesses do not meet return expectations 
this could cause us to decide to exit a business which could trigger long lived asset impairment 
inventory reserves we reduce the carrying value of inventories to reflect an estimate of net realizable value for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
if we have had no sales of a given product for months  those items are generally deemed to have no value and are written down completely 
if we have more than a one year s supply of a product  we value that inventory at net realizable value what we think we will recover 
our inventory reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions about the value of products that are obsolete or slow moving ie not selling very quickly 
changes in customer behavior and requirements can cause inventory to quickly become obsolete or slow moving 
the calculation also uses an estimate of the ultimate recoverability of items identified as slow moving based upon historical experience on average 
at december   we had recorded an inventory reserve of million approximately of fifo inventories to account for obsolete inventories 
prior to  additions to inventory reserves averaged million per year 
in  additions to reserves decreased to million due to improved inventory optimization in the residential furnishings and commercial fixturing components segments 
approximately two thirds of historical write downs relate to the commercial fixturing components and specialized products segments due to the custom nature of their products 

table of contents part ii description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions inventory reserves cont 
we have implemented new inventory optimization processes in many of our businesses that should reduce the impact of write downs in the future 
we do not expect any significant changes in customer or industry trends that would increase the exposure to inventory obsolescence 
workers compensation we are substantially self insured for costs related to workers compensation  and this requires us to estimate the liability associated with this obligation 
our estimates of self insured reserves contain uncertainties regarding the potential amounts we might have to pay since we are self insured 
we consider a number of factors  including historical claim experience  demographic factors  and potential recoveries from third party insurance carriers 
over the past five years  we have incurred  on average  million annually for costs associated with workers compensation 
average year to year variation over the past five years has been approximately million 
at december   we had accrued million to cover future self insurance liabilities 
internal safety statistics indicate improving safety trends in the last two years 
usually  safety statistics are leading indicators of exposure trends 
as a result of headcount reductions and improved safety trends  we expect worker compensation costs to remain at current lower levels for the foreseeable future 

table of contents part ii description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions credit losses for accounts and notes receivable  we estimate a bad debt reserve for the amount that will ultimately be uncollectible 
when we become aware of a specific customer s potential inability to pay  we record a bad debt reserve for the amount we believe may not be collectible 
our bad debt reserve contains uncertainties because it requires management to estimate the amount uncollectible based upon an evaluation of several factors such as the length of time that receivables are past due  the financial health of the customer  industry and macroeconomic considerations  and historical loss experience 
our customers are diverse and many are small to medium sized companies  with some being highly leveraged 
bankruptcy can occur with some of these customers relatively quickly and with little warning 
a significant change in the financial status of a large customer could impact our estimates 
the average annual amount of customer related credit losses was million less than of annual net sales over the last three years 
at december   our reserves for doubtful accounts totaled million about of our accounts and notes receivable of million 
weak market demand intensified pressure on highly leveraged customers in some of our industries 
in each of and  we experienced bad debt expense that was approximately million higher than pre levels 
in  bad debt expense returned to more normal levels  however if weak market demand persists  other bankruptcies could be possible 
we also recognized an million loss in related to the aluminum divestiture note 
at december   we had million of notes outstanding  primarily related to divested businesses  and have concluded that no material reserve is required for these notes 

table of contents part ii description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions pension accounting for our pension plans  we must estimate the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and the current value of those benefit obligations 
the pension liability calculation contains uncertainties because it requires management to estimate an appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of future benefits paid  which also impacts current year pension expense 
determination of pension expense requires an estimate of expected return on pension assets based upon the mix of investments held bonds and equities 
other assumptions include rates of compensation increases  withdrawal and mortality rates  and retirement ages 
these estimates impact the pension expense or income we recognize and our reported benefit obligations 
the discount rates used to calculate the pension liability and pension expense for our most significant plans decreased approximately basis points in due to lower corporate bond yields 
each basis point decrease in the discount rate increases pension expense by approximately 
million and decreases the plans funded status by approximately million 
the expected return on assets in held steady at  compared to in after decreasing from in 
the reduction in the rate during was primarily driven by a change in asset allocation toward more conservative investments ie bonds 
a basis point reduction in the expected return on assets would increase pension expense by 
million  but have no effect on the plans funded status 
assuming a long term investment horizon  we do not expect a material change to the return on asset assumption 

table of contents part ii description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions income taxes in the ordinary course of business  we must make estimates of the tax treatment of many transactions  even though the ultimate tax outcome may remain uncertain for some time 
these estimates become part of the annual income tax expense reported in our financial statements 
subsequent to year end  we finalize our tax analysis and file income tax returns 
tax authorities periodically audit these income tax returns and examine our tax filing positions  including among other things the timing and amounts of deductions  and the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions 
we adjust income tax expense in our financial statements in the periods in which the actual outcome becomes more certain 
our tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures related to our various filing positions 
our effective tax rate is also impacted by changes in tax laws  the current mix of earnings by taxing jurisdiction  and the results of current tax audits and assessments 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet related to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the amount  source  and timing of future taxable income 
valuation allowances are established against future potential tax benefits to reflect the amounts we believe have no more than a probability of being realized 
in addition  assumptions have been made regarding the non repatriation of earnings from certain subsidiaries 
those assumptions may change in the future  thereby affecting future period results for the tax impact of possible repatriation 
potential changes in tax laws could impact assumptions related to the non repatriation of certain foreign earnings 
if all non repatriated earnings were taxed  we would incur additional taxes of approximately million 
tax audits by various taxing authorities are expected to increase as governments continue to look for ways to raise additional revenue 
based upon past experience  we do not expect any major changes to our tax liability as a result of this increased audit activity  however  we could incur additional tax expense if we have audit adjustments higher than recent historical experience 
the recovery of net operating losses nol s has been closely evaluated for the likelihood of recovery based upon factors such as the age of losses  viable tax planning strategies  and future taxable earnings expectations 
we believe that appropriate valuation allowances have been recorded as necessary 
however  if earnings expectations or other assumptions change such that additional valuation allowances are required  we could incur additional tax expense 

table of contents part ii description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions contingencies we evaluate various legal  environmental  and other potential claims against us to determine if an accrual or disclosure of the contingency is appropriate 
if it is probable that an ultimate loss will be incurred  we accrue a liability for the estimate of the ultimate loss 
our disclosure and accrual of loss contingencies ie  losses that may or may not occur contain uncertainties because they are based on our assessment of the likelihood that the expenses will actually occur  and our estimate of the likely cost 
our estimates and judgments are subjective and can involve matters in litigation  the results of which are generally very unpredictable 
we have several environmental clean up activities related to current and closed facilities that mostly involve soil and groundwater contamination 
based upon facts available at this time  we believe reserves are adequate  however cost estimates could change as we determine more about the severity and cost of remediation

npi lawsuit on january   national products  inc npi sued gamber johnson  llc gamber  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  in case c c jlr  in the united states district court  western district of washington  alleging that portions of a gamber marketing video contained false and misleading statements 
npi and gamber compete in the market for vehicle computer mounting systems 
npi sought a injunctive relief requiring gamber to stop using the video and to notify customers  b damages for its alleged lost profits  and c disgorgement of gamber s profits in an unspecified amount 
although part of the claims were dismissed by the court before and during trial  a jury  on april   found four statements in the video were false and deliberate and awarded million in disgorgement damages against gamber 
on august  the court a reduced the jury verdict to approximately million  b granted npi attorney fees and costs in an amount to be determined  and c granted an injunction requiring gamber to notify its distributors and resellers of the verdict 
the court subsequently awarded npi million in attorney s fees and costs 
we believe that gamber has valid bases upon which the appellate court could overturn the verdict and the award of attorney fees and costs 
we intend to vigorously pursue an appeal 
npi has also filed an appeal 
we established an accrual for this suit in an amount we believe is probable 
also  we believe that it is probable that at least part of the verdict  attorney s fees and costs will be covered by insurance  but that coverage is subject to the insurance company s reservation of rights 
shareholder derivative lawsuit on august   a shareholder derivative suit was filed by the new england carpenters pension fund in the circuit court of jasper county  missouri as case no 
ao cc the suit is substantially similar to a prior suit filed by the same plaintiff  in the same court  on february  the prior suit was dismissed without prejudice based on its failure to make demand on the company s board and shareholders 
as before  the plaintiff has not made such demand 
the new suit was purportedly brought on the company s behalf  naming it as a nominal defendant  and certain current and former officers and directors as individual defendants including david s

table of contents part ii company s stock plans  caused or allowed the company to issue false and misleading financial statements and proxy statements  sold company stock while possessing material non public information  committed gross mismanagement  wasted corporate assets  committed fraud  violated the missouri securities act  and were unjustly enriched 
the plaintiff is seeking  among other things unspecified monetary damages against the individual defendants  certain equitable and other relief relating to the profits from the alleged improper conduct  the adoption of certain company corporate governance proposals  the imposition of a constructive trust over the defendants stock options and proceeds  punitive damages  the rescission of certain unexercised options  and the reimbursement of litigation costs 
the plaintiff is not seeking monetary relief from the company 
the company has director and officer liability insurance in force subject to customary limits and exclusions 
the company and the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss the suit in late october  asserting the plaintiff failed to make demand on the company s board and shareholders as required by missouri law  and  consistent with the court s ruling in the prior suit  this failure to make demand should not be excused  the plaintiff is not a representative shareholder  the suit is based on a statistical analysis of stock option grants and company stock prices that the company believes is flawed  the plaintiff failed to state a substantive claim  the common law fraud claim was not pled with sufficient particularity  and the statute of limitations has expired on the fraud claim and all the alleged challenged grants except the december  grant 
as to this grant  the motions to dismiss advised the court that it was made under the company s deferred compensation program  which i provided that options would be dated on the last business day of december  and ii was filed with the sec on december  setting out the pricing mechanism well before the grant date 
the hearing on the motions to dismiss is scheduled for march  we expect that the outcome of this suit will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  operating cash flows or results of operations 
antitrust lawsuits beginning in august  a series of civil lawsuits was initiated in several us federal courts alleging that competitors of the company s carpet underlay division and other manufacturers of polyurethane foam products had engaged in price fixing in violation of us antitrust laws

the company has been named as a defendant in six cases  five of which have been transferred to the us district court for the northern district of ohio under the name in re polyurethane foam antitrust litigation  case no 
md the first case in which the company was named as a party martin furniture bedding  inc v 
fxi foamex innovations  inc  et al  case no 
cv western district of north carolina was instituted on november   and is also expected to be transferred 
in the suits to which the company is a party  the plaintiffs  on behalf of the class of purchasers  seek three times the amount of unspecified damages allegedly suffered as a result of alleged overcharges in the price of polyurethane foam products during the period 
table of contents part ii to the present in one case  and from at least to the present in the other five cases 
each plaintiff also seeks attorneys fees  pre judgment and post judgment interest  court costs  and injunctive relief against future violations 
we expect the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint in the consolidated case on or before february  the company denies all of the allegations and will vigorously defend itself 
this contingency is subject to many uncertainties 
therefore  based on the information available to date  we cannot estimate the amount or range of potential loss  if any 
at this time  we do not believe that it is probable that the outcome will have a material effect on the company s financial condition  operating cash flows or results of operations 
new accounting standards we adopted new accounting guidance in as discussed in note a to the consolidated financial statements on page the financial accounting standards board has also issued accounting guidance effective for future periods that we have not yet adopted  but we do not believe this new guidance will have a material impact on our future financial statements
