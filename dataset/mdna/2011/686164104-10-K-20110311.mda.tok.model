item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to those set forth under item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview background we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of pharmaceutical product candidates for the treatment of obesity 
our lead combination product candidates targeted for obesity are contrave  which has completed phase iii clinical trials  and empatic  which has completed phase ii clinical trials 
each of these product candidates is a combination of generic drugs  which we have systematically screened for synergistic cns activity 
each of the components of our product candidates has already received regulatory approval and has been commercialized previously 
we are developing these combinations in an effort to demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety for potential regulatory approval 
we have not yet received regulatory approval for either product candidate 
we were incorporated in september and commenced operations in in january  we received a complete response letter  or crl  from the us food and drug administration  or fda  concerning our previously submitted new drug application  or nda  for contrave 
a crl is issued by the fda when the review of an nda is completed and questions remain that precludes the approval of the nda in its current form 
the crl for contrave indicated that the fda could not approve the nda in its present form primarily due to concerns regarding the cardiovascular safety profile of contrave when used long term in a population of overweight and obese subjects 
the crl stated that before our nda could be approved  we must conduct a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled trial of sufficient size and duration to demonstrate that the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in overweight and obese subjects treated with contrave does not adversely affect the drug s benefit risk profile 
we intend to work closely with the fda and our partner  takeda pharmaceuticals company limited  or takeda  to assess the appropriate next steps for the contrave nda  and our management is in the process of updating our corporate strategy following the receipt of the crl 
at this time  we cannot quantify the development expenses associated with the trial contemplated by the crl 
in february  we implemented a corporate realignment of our workforce  resulting in a reduction in staff of approximately  or employees 
we expect to incur restructuring charges in the first quarter of of approximately million in connection with one time employee termination costs  including severance and other benefits 
our primary activities since incorporation have been organizational activities  including recruiting personnel  conducting research and development  including clinical trials  and raising capital 
we have incurred significant net losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
these losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with research and development activities  primarily costs of clinical trial activities associated with our current product candidates  and general and administrative expenses 
we expect to continue to incur losses for the next several years 
successful transition to attaining profitable operations is dependent upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support our cost structure  and until that time  we will need to continue to raise additional equity or debt financing 
management believes that it has sufficient capital to fund operations through at least the next months 
in january  we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share 
net cash proceeds from the public offering were approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses payable by us 
in february  the 
table of contents underwriters exercised a portion of their overallotment option and purchased an additional  shares of our common stock  from which we received cash proceeds  net of underwriting discounts  of approximately million 
in july  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share 
net cash proceeds from the public offering were million  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses 
revenues we generated approximately million in revenue in  resulting from the sublicensing of technology and amounts earned under a collaborative agreement 
in september  we entered into a collaboration agreement with takeda to develop and commercialize contrave in the united states  canada and mexico 
under the collaboration agreement  we received an upfront  nonrefundable cash payment of million from takeda and this amount is being recognized ratably over the estimated life of the agreement 
for  we recognized revenue of approximately million related to the takeda agreement 
during  we sublicensed technology to cypress bioscience  inc  or cypress  for an upfront payment of million  and this amount is being recognized ratably over the estimated life of the sublicensed patent 
in addition  we recognized revenue of approximately  during the year ended december  related to a collaborative agreement with eli lilly and company  or eli lilly  the term of which has since expired 
other than the amortization of the upfront payment of million from takeda  we do not expect to generate any significant revenues from licensing  achievement of milestones or product sales unless and until we are able to obtain regulatory approval of  and commercialize  our product candidates 
research and development expenses the majority of our operating expenses to date have been incurred in research and development activities 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with clinical trials managed by our contract research organizations  or cros  product development efforts and manufacturing costs 
license fees  salaries and related employee benefits for certain personnel  and costs associated with certain non clinical activities such as regulatory expenses  are also included in this amount 
our most significant costs to date are expenses incurred in connection with the clinical trials for contrave and empatic 
the clinical trial expenses include payments to vendors such as cros  investigators  suppliers of clinical drug materials and related consultants 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred because the underlying technology associated with these expenditures relates to our research and development efforts and has no alternative future uses 
at any time  we have several ongoing research projects 
our internal research and development resources are not directly tied to any individual research project and are primarily deployed across our contrave and empatic programs  both of which target the obesity market 
we are developing our two obesity product candidates in parallel and  due to the fact that we use shared resources across projects  we do not maintain information regarding our internal costs incurred for our research and development programs on a program specific basis 
we use external service providers to manage our clinical trials  to manufacture the product supplies used in these trials and for formulations development  consulting and other activities 

table of contents the following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the year ended december  costs that are not attributable to a specific research program are included in the other category in thousands costs of external service providers obesity other subtotal internal costs stock based compensation total research and development costs at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the early stage of our product development programs  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our product candidates for potential commercialization 
clinical development timelines  the probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations 
while we are currently focused on advancing each of our product development programs  our future research and development expenses will depend on the clinical success of each product candidate  as well as ongoing assessments as to each product candidate s commercial potential 
in addition  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which product candidates will be subject to future collaborations  when such arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
at this time  we cannot quantify the development expenses associated with the trial for contrave contemplated by the crl 
future development expenses will depend on the scope and timing of the additional clinical trials for contrave  our financial resources  as well as decisions made with respect to our empatic program 
the lengthy process of completing our clinical trials and seeking regulatory approval for our product candidates requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us or delay in completing our clinical trials  or in obtaining regulatory approvals  could cause a delay in the commencement of product revenues and cause our research and development expenses to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we do not expect any of our current product candidates to be commercially available in major markets for several years  if at all 
general and administrative our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting and internal support functions 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include professional fees for legal  consulting and accounting services 
we anticipate increases in general and administrative expenses as we add personnel  comply with the reporting obligations applicable to publicly held companies  and continue to build our corporate infrastructure in support of our continued development and preparation for the potential commercialization of our product candidates 
other income expense other income consists of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investment securities 
interest expense consists of interest incurred in connection with the million credit and security agreement  as amended  with ge healthcare financial services 
income taxes at december   we have federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards begin to 
table of contents expire in and  respectively  unless previously utilized 
at december   we have federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
the federal research and development tax credit carryforwards begin to expire in unless previously utilized and the state tax credits carry forward indefinitely 
under section and of the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the internal revenue code  substantial changes in our ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income 
an analysis was performed which indicated that multiple ownership changes have occurred in previous years which created annual limitations on our ability to utilize our net operating loss  or nol  and tax credit carryovers 
such limitations will result in approximately  of tax benefits related to nol and tax credit carryforwards that will expire unused 
accordingly  the related net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards have been removed from deferred tax assets accompanied by a corresponding reduction of the valuation allowance 
due to the existence of the valuation allowance  limitations created by future ownership changes  if any  will not impact our effective tax rate 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
research and development expenses a substantial portion of our ongoing research and development activities are performed under agreements we enter into with external service providers  including cros  which conduct many of our research and development activities 
we accrue for costs incurred under these contracts based on factors such as estimates of work performed  patient enrollment  progress of patient studies and other events 
however  the level of estimates can be significant 
to date  we have not made any material adjustments to our estimates of clinical trial expenses 
we make good faith estimates that we believe to be accurate  but the actual costs and timing of clinical trials are highly uncertain  subject to risks and may change depending upon a number of factors  including our clinical development plan 
revenue recognition we have entered into agreements with takeda and cypress bioscience  inc  or cypress  which contain multiple elements  including nonrefundable upfront fees  payments for reimbursement of research costs  payments associated with achieving specific development milestones and royalties based on specified percentages of net product sales  if any 
we consider a variety of factors in determining the appropriate method of revenue recognition under these arrangements  such as whether the elements are separable  whether there are determinable fair values and whether there is a unique earnings process associated with each element of a contract 
if the required ongoing obligations involve minimal or no cost or effort  nonrefundable upfront fees would be recognized upon receipt 
otherwise  nonrefundable upfront fees are recognized over the period the related services are provided or over the period that we maintain significant involvement 
revenue from milestones is recognized as certain anniversary  regulatory and sales based events are achieved  as long as the event is substantial and was not readily assured at the beginning of the collaboration 
advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 

table of contents stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation to employees in accordance with the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation arrangements which requires us to expense the estimated fair value of non cash  stock based payments to employees 
share based payment transactions with employees are recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value and recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period 
we grant options to purchase our common stock to our employees  directors and non employees under our equity incentive award plan 
stock based compensation expense for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
at december   total unrecognized estimated stock based compensation expense related to non vested stock options granted prior to that date was million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
we calculate the fair value of stock option grants using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  risk free interest rate and the expected term of the awards 
the weighted average expected life of options was calculated using the simplified method as prescribed by the securities exchange commission 
this decision was based on the lack of relevant historical data due to our limited historical experience 
for options granted during the year ended december   we have calculated a weighted average expected term of years 
in addition  due to our limited historical data  the estimated volatility incorporates the historical volatility of comparable companies whose share prices are publicly available 
for purposes of estimating the fair value of stock options granted during using the black scholes model  we used estimated weighted average stock price volatility of 
the risk free interest rate assumption was based on the united states treasury s rates for us treasury zero coupon bonds with maturities similar to those of the expected term of the award being valued weighted average risk free interest rate of for the year ended december  
the assumed dividend yield was based on our expectation of not paying dividends in the foreseeable future 
for  and  we have reduced stock based compensation expense recognized in the statement of operations to reflect estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
pre vesting forfeitures were estimated to be approximately for all years ended december   and based on historical experience 
equity instruments issued to non employees are recorded at their fair value and are periodically revalued as the equity instruments vest and are recognized as expense over the related service period 
income taxes we follow the provisions of the income taxes topic of the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  that defines a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax provision taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the topic also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
under the topic  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates which will be in effect when the differences reverse 
we provide a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets unless  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 

table of contents results of operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the years ended december  and were million and  respectively 
the increase of million was due to revenue recognized under the collaboration agreement with takeda 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in this decrease of approximately million was due primarily to a decrease in expenses in connection with our contrave phase iii clinical trials  related proprietary product formulation work and consulting activities totaling million 
the decrease in research and development expenses was partly offset by an increase in salaries and personnel related costs totaling approximately million and an increase in costs incurred in connection with the preparation for our nda filing and fda advisory committee meeting for contrave of million 
in addition  research and development expenses for were offset by approximately  of certain commercial costs to be reimbursed by takeda as permitted under the collaboration agreement and also by  awarded to us by the department of treasury under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project grant program 
general and administrative expenses

general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million in this increase of million was principally due to increases in salaries and personnel related costs totaling million  an increase in medical affairs expense of  an increase in recruiting expense of  and an increase in public relations costs of  the increases were partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation costs totaling approximately million 
interest income 
interest income decreased to  for the year ended december  from million in this decrease of approximately million was primarily due to lower interest rates and a decrease in average cash and investment balances 

table of contents interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in this decrease of approximately  was primarily due to the decrease in interest expense resulting from a lower average interest rate and a lower average outstanding balance on the million borrowed under the credit and security agreement with ge healthcare financial services as of december  liquidity and capital resources since inception  our operations have been financed primarily through the sale of equity securities 
through december   we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of shares of our preferred and common stock as follows from september  to december   we issued and sold a total of  shares of common stock for aggregate net proceeds of in march  we issued and sold a total of  shares of series a redeemable convertible preferred stock for aggregate net proceeds of million and the conversion of promissory notes and interest thereon totaling million  from april to may  we issued and sold  shares of series b redeemable convertible preferred stock for aggregate net proceeds of million  in november  we issued and sold a total of  shares of series c convertible preferred stock for aggregate net proceeds of million  in may  we issued and sold a total of  shares of common stock for aggregate net proceeds of million  in january and february  we issued and sold a total of  shares of common stock for aggregate net proceeds of million  and in july  we issued and sold a total of  shares of common stock for aggregate net proceeds of million 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and an additional million in investment securities  available for sale 
as of december   our holdings primarily consisted of treasury backed money market funds  treasuries and other instruments that are insured  guaranteed or supported by the us federal government and some high quality corporate debt obligations 
we maintain established guidelines relating to diversification and maturities of our investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for and net cash used in operating activities was million for in  we received an upfront payment of million from takeda 
net cash used in each of these periods was primarily a result of external research and development expenses  clinical trial costs  personnel related costs  third party supplier expenses and professional fees 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million for and  respectively 
these amounts are primarily the result of the net purchases and maturities of investment securities 
net cash used in financing activities for was million and net cash provided by financing activities for was million 
the net cash provided by financing activities for is primarily as a result of the public sale of our common stock in july for aggregate net proceeds of million 
we cannot be certain if  when or to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization of our product candidates 
we may incur substantial additional development expenses to conduct the trial 
table of contents contemplated by the fda s crl for contrave 
specifically  the crl for contrave indicated that the fda could not approve the nda in its present form primarily due to concerns regarding the cardiovascular safety profile of contrave when used long term in a population of overweight and obese subjects 
the crl stated that before our nda could be approved  we must conduct a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled trial of sufficient size and duration to demonstrate that the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in overweight and obese subjects treated with contrave does not adversely affect the drug s benefit risk profile 
we intend to work closely with the fda and our partner  takeda  to assess the appropriate next steps for the contrave nda  and our management is in the process of updating our corporate strategy following the receipt of the crl 
at this time  we cannot quantify the development expenses associated with the trial contemplated by the crl 
we have entered into license agreements to acquire the rights to develop and commercialize contrave and empatic 
pursuant to these agreements  we obtained exclusive and non exclusive licenses to the patent rights and know how for selected indications and territories 
under our license agreement with duke university  we issued  shares of our common stock in march and may be required to make future milestone payments totaling up to million upon the achievement of various milestones related to regulatory or commercial events 
under our license agreement with lee dante  md  we issued an option to purchase  shares of our common stock in april we also paid dr 
dante an upfront fee of  and  in september  we paid him an additional million upon the execution of the collaboration agreement with takeda 
in the future  we may be obligated to pay royalties to dr 
dante related to certain revenues we receive in connection with any sublicense agreements we enter into  including our collaboration agreement with takeda 
under our license agreement with oregon health science university  we issued  shares of our common stock in december and paid an upfront fee of  under these three agreements  we are also obligated to pay royalties on any net sales of the licensed products 
under our license agreement with smithkline beecham corporation and glaxo group limited  we paid an upfront payment and may be required to make a future milestone payment upon the earliest achievement of certain milestones primarily relating to regulatory or commercial events 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the following the timing of potential approval of our nda for contrave  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing  co promotion or other arrangements that we may establish with respect to contrave or empatic  the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other product development programs for contrave  to the extent additional clinical trials need to be conducted  and empatic  including expenses to support the trials and milestone payments that may become payable  the costs of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities in order to commercialize contrave  should we elect to do so  the costs involved in enforcing or defending patent claims or other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals for empatic  the successful commercialization of our products  and the extent to which we in license  acquire or invest in other indications  products  technologies and businesses 
in december  we entered into a credit and security agreement with merrill lynch capital providing for potential borrowing until june  of up to million 
in july  we entered into a first amendment to the credit and security agreement with merrill lynch capital 
the first amendment provided for  among other things  the extension of the period during which merrill lynch capital was obligated to make advances under the credit and security agreement to us from june  to december  in november  we entered 
table of contents into a second amendment to the credit and security agreement with merrill lynch capital 
the second amendment provided for  among other things  the increase of the total amount available for advances under the credit and security agreement from million to million  our obligation to request an advance of million on or before december   and the extension of the period during which merrill lynch capital was obligated to make advances to us under the credit and security agreement from december  to december  ge healthcare financial services acquired a portfolio of loans from merrill lynch capital in  and the credit and security agreement  as amended  was subsequently assigned to ge healthcare financial services 
we drew down million  million and million under the credit and security agreement in march  december and december  respectively 
under the credit and security agreement  we are required to make monthly payments of principal and interest and all amounts then outstanding will become due and payable upon the earlier to occur of july  or three years from the funding of any amounts under the agreement 
interest accrues on amounts outstanding under the agreement at a base rate set forth in the agreement plus an applicable margin  which ranges from to based on the date of borrowing 
amounts outstanding under the credit and security agreement at december  bear interest at an average rate of 
the loan is collateralized by substantially all of our assets other than  subject to certain limited exceptions  intellectual property 
subject to certain limited exceptions  amounts prepaid under the credit and security agreement are subject to a prepayment fee equal to of the amount prepaid 
in addition  upon repayment of the amounts borrowed for any reason  we will be required to pay an exit fee of approximately million 
under the terms of the agreement  we are subject to operational covenants  including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt  pay dividends  redeem our stock  make specified investments and engage in merger  consolidation or asset sale transactions  among other restrictions 
as of december   million is outstanding under this agreement 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements through at least the next months 
until we can generate significant cash from our operations  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources  proceeds of potential offerings of our equity securities  debt  receivables or royalty financings and potential corporate collaborations and licensing arrangements 
however  we cannot be sure that our existing cash and investment resources will be adequate  that additional financing will be available when needed or that  if available  financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
having insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs and or our pre commercialization and commercialization activities  relinquish some or even all rights to product candidates or renegotiate less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose 
failure to obtain adequate financing also may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders would likely result 
debt  receivables and royalty financings may be coupled with an equity component  such as warrants to purchase stock  which could also result in dilution of our existing stockholders ownership 
if we raise additional funds through debt  receivables or royalty financings  the terms of such financings may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial requirements that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
continued turbulence in the us and international markets and economies may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if these market conditions continue  they may limit our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments the following table describes our long term contractual obligations and commitments as of december  in thousands payments due by periods total less than year years years after long term debt obligations long term liabilities operating lease obligations purchase obligations license obligations total in december  we entered into a credit and security agreement with merrill lynch capital  which was subsequently assigned to ge healthcare financial services  providing for the potential borrowing of up to million 
in november  the amount available for borrowing under the credit and security agreement was increased to million 
in march  december and december  we drew down million  million and million  respectively  under the credit and security agreement 
primarily represents fees due to the lender incurred in connection with our credit and security agreement  as amended  with ge healthcare financial services due on the earlier of the repayment of total amounts borrowed or termination of the agreement 
as of december   we had outstanding purchase orders totaling approximately million for commercial supplies for use in our drug products from various suppliers 
subsequent to december   we cancelled approximately million of these obligations 
license obligations do not include additional payments of up to million due upon the occurrence of certain milestones related to regulatory or commercial events 
we may also be required to pay royalties on any net sales of the licensed products 
license payments may increase based on the timing of various milestones and the extent to which the licensed technologies are pursued for other indications 
these milestone payments and royalty payments under our license agreements are not included in the table above because we cannot  at this time  determine when or if the related milestones will be achieved or the events triggering the commencement of payment obligations will occur 
in january  cypress exercised its right to terminate the agreement 
we also enter into agreements with third parties to manufacture our product candidates  conduct our clinical trials and perform data collection and analysis 
our payment obligations under these agreements depend upon the progress of our development programs 
therefore  we are unable at this time to estimate with certainty the future costs we will incur under these agreements 
recently issued accounting standards in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an amendment to the accounting standards related to the accounting for revenue in arrangements with multiple deliverables including how the arrangement consideration is allocated among delivered and undelivered items of the arrangement 
among the amendments  this standard eliminates the use of the residual method for allocating arrangement consideration and requires an entity to allocate the overall consideration to each deliverable based on an estimated selling price of each individual deliverable in the arrangement in the absence of having vendor specific objective evidence or other third party evidence of fair value of the undelivered items 
this standard also provides further guidance on how to determine a separate unit of accounting in a multiple deliverable revenue arrangement and expands the disclosure requirements about the judgments made in applying the estimated selling price method and how those judgments affect the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
this standard  for which we are currently assessing the impact  became effective for us on january  
table of contents in january  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures topic  improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu no 

asu no 
requires new disclosures about significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and the reasons for such transfers and in the reconciliation for level fair value measurements the requirement to disclose separately information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements 
we adopted the provisions of asu no 
on january   except for disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the reconciliation for level fair value measurements 
those disclosures will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the impact of its adoption to be material to our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition milestone method asu no 

asu no 
establishes a revenue recognition method for contingent consideration that is payable upon the achievement of an uncertain future event  referred to as a milestone 
the scope of the milestone method is limited to research and development agreements and is applicable to milestones in multiple deliverable arrangements involving research and development transactions 
the guidance does not preclude the application of any other applicable revenue guidance 
the guidance will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  early adoption is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of asu no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not engaged in any off balance sheet activities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash and cash equivalents and investment securities  available for sale  as of december  consisted primarily of money market funds and us government agency securities 
we do not have any auction rate securities on our balance sheet  as they are not permitted by our investment policy 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term marketable debt securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the value of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we purchase a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the value of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we intend to continue to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities including commercial paper  money market funds and government and non government debt securities  all with various maturities 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
our cash is invested in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors which specifies the categories  allocations  and ratings of securities we may consider for investment 
we do not believe our cash  cash equivalents and investment securities have significant risk of default or illiquidity 
we made this determination based on discussions with our investment advisors and a review of our holdings 
while we believe our cash  cash equivalents and investment securities are well diversified and do not contain excessive risk  we cannot provide assurance that in the future our investments will not be subject to adverse changes in market value 
in addition  domestic and international equity markets have experienced and may continue to experience heightened volatility and turmoil based on domestic and international economic conditions and concerns 
in the event these economic conditions and concerns continue and the markets continue to remain volatile  our results of operations could be adversely affected by those factors in many ways  including making it more difficult for us to raise funds if necessary and our stock price may further decline 
in addition  we maintain significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents that are not federally insured 
if economic instability continues  we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience losses on these investments
