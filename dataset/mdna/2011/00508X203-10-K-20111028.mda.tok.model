item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background as discussed in item  business  we are a global diversified company that manufactures a broad range of industrial products and systems and are organized into four reportable segments  industrial  energy  electrical and engineered solutions 
the industrial segment is primarily involved in the design  manufacture and distribution of branded hydraulic and mechanical tools to the maintenance  industrial  infrastructure and production automation markets 
the energy segment provides joint integrity products and services  as well as umbilical  rope and cable solutions to the global oil gas  power generation and energy markets 
the electrical segment designs  manufactures and distributes a broad range of electrical products to the retail diy  wholesale  oem  solar  utility  marine and other harsh environment markets 
the engineered solutions segment provides highly engineered position and motion control systems to oems in various vehicle markets  as well as a variety of other products to the industrial and agricultural markets 
our businesses provide a vast array of products and services across multiple customers and geographies which results in significant diversification to our overall enterprise 
most end markets we serve slowed dramatically in fiscal and into early fiscal  as a result of the global recession 
since then  the majority of our end markets have improved  the result of increased global industrial output  improved worldwide demand for energy  elevated industrial manufacturing activities and increased production of vehicles for the heavy duty truck  construction  military and agricultural markets 
the long term sales growth and profitability of our segments will depend not only on improved demand in end markets and the overall economic environment  but also on our ability to identify  consummate and integrate strategic acquisitions  develop and market innovative new products  expand our business activity geographically and continuously improve operational excellence 
we remain focused on maintaining our financial strength by continually adjusting our cost structure to reflect changes in demand levels  if needed  and by proactively managing working capital and cash flow generation 
our priorities during fiscal include a continued focus on operational excellence  cash flow generation and growth initiatives new product development  market share gains and strategic acquisitions 
results of operations the comparability of operating results has been impacted by acquisitions  divestitures and the economic conditions that existed in the end markets we serve 
the operating results of acquired businesses are included in our consolidated financial statements only since their respective acquisition date 
in addition to acquisitions  changes in foreign currency exchange rates also influence our financial results as approximately half of our sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the year over year weakening of the us dollar during fiscal favorably impacted our operating results due to the translation of non us dollar denominated results 
impairment charges  restructuring costs and the related benefits from previously completed restructuring projects also impact the comparability of financial results 
since fiscal we have taken significant actions to address our cost structure  including workforce reductions  consolidation of facilities and the centralization of certain selling and administrative functions

in addition to the impact of economic conditions  the comparability between periods is impacted by acquisitions  the million impairment charge in fiscal and the timing and amount of restructuring charges and related benefits 
changes in operating profit at the segment level are discussed in further detail below 

table of contents segment results industrial segment during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the industrial segment delivered its sixth consecutive quarter of year over year double digit core sales growth due to robust demand across nearly all geographic regions 
this increased sales volume  coupled with the benefits of previous restructuring actions  drove significant year over year improvement in operating profits 
the industrial segment continues to focus on operational excellence manufacturing  distribution  sourcing and supply chain management  the commercialization of new products and expansion of its business in fast growing regions and vertical markets 
the following table sets forth the results of operations for the industrial segment in millions year ended august  net sales operating profit operating profit fiscal compared to fiscal compared to fiscal  industrial segment net sales increased million during fiscal the acquisition of two integrated solutions businesses hydrospex and team hydrotec contributed million of sales for the twelve months ended august  excluding sales from these acquisitions and the weaker us dollar million  core sales growth for fiscal was 
in addition to generally improved macroeconomic conditions  the increased sales were the result of new product introductions and increased demand from distributors and end users in the mining  oil gas and general maintenance industries 
industrial segment operating profits reached million for the year ended august  compared to million during fiscal fiscal operating profit comparisons were favorably impacted by increased sales volumes and a million reduction in restructuring costs 
the expansion of the industrial segment operating profit margin  despite unfavorable acquisition mix and additional costs associated with growth initiatives  was the result of a lower cost structure from past restructuring actions and increased production levels higher absorption of fixed manufacturing costs 
fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal industrial segment net sales increased by million to million  relative to fiscal excluding foreign currency rate changes which favorably impacted fiscal sales by million and sales from acquired businesses  core sales declined during fiscal end markets in the industrial segment were not significantly impacted by the global economic environment until the second quarter of fiscal  and therefore full year fiscal core sales comparisons were unfavorable 
however  sales levels and the core sales trend improved significantly during the second half of fiscal  primarily the result of increasing global demand and comparatively lower sales levels in the prior year period due to the impact of the recession in fiscal 
industrial segment operating profit decreased by million to million in fiscal despite increased sales levels  operating profit margins declined  the result of million of incremental restructuring costs in fiscal related to the consolidation of facilities  unfavorable acquisition mix and higher incentive compensation costs  somewhat offset by cost savings from restructuring actions 
energy segment being a later cycle business  our energy segment was the last of our four segments to recover from the global recession 
strong core sales growth during fiscal including double digit growth in the second half of 
table of contents the year reflects increased global demand and easier year over year comparisons resulting from the lower overall levels of demand that prevailed during fiscal increased worldwide requirements for energy and higher oil prices during fiscal despite recent declines encouraged customers and asset owners to invest in capital projects or complete previously deferred maintenance activities 
as a result  we experienced broad based strength across this segment in the second half of fiscal the following table sets forth the results of operations for the energy segment in millions year ended august  net sales operating profit operating profit fiscal compared to fiscal energy segment net sales for the fiscal year ended august  increased million to million from million a year ago 
excluding million of sales from the selantic and biach acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency rate changes which favorably impacted fiscal sales by million  core sales increased 
the increase was the result of higher activity levels across nearly all of the segment s primary markets including capital project activity in the oil gas market  maintenance related spending in north america and emerging markets and strong sales to the power generation market 
energy segment operating profit increased million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the year over year increase in operating profit margins is primarily the result of continued productivity improvements and significantly increased operating leverage  a million reduction in restructuring charges and favorable acquisition mix  partially offset by higher incentive compensation costs 
fiscal compared to fiscal energy segment net sales in fiscal were million  a million reduction compared to fiscal excluding sales from acquired businesses and foreign currency changes which favorably impacted fiscal sales by million  core sales decreased during the year 
this decline reflected the continued deferral of maintenance activities at certain oil gas installations especially in mature refinery markets and lower capital project based revenue 
the core sales trend improved slightly during the second half of fiscal due to growth in emerging markets  alternative energy and adjacent markets 
energy segment operating profit decreased by million to million for fiscal reduced operating profits were primarily due to low sales volumes  unfavorable product mix and an additional million of restructuring costs in fiscal  relative to fiscal electrical segment many of the end markets that the electrical segment serves including retail diy  solar  construction and marine continued to experience weak demand throughout fiscal  the result of ongoing weak consumer confidence  low construction market spending and uncertainty in worldwide economic conditions 
future electrical segment results will be dependent on fluctuations in commodity costs  the realization of price increases  changes in european solar feed in tariffs and end market demand 
the electrical segment continues to focus on successfully integrating the mastervolt business and achieving the related cost savings and synergies 
the following table sets forth the results of operations for the electrical segment in millions year ended august  net sales operating profit operating profit 
table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal compared to the prior year  fiscal electrical segment net sales increased million to million  with mastervolt contributing sales of million since its acquisition in december excluding sales from this acquisition and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates  core sales were flat for fiscal  compared to the prior year period 
electrical segment operating profit for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal excluding restructuring costs  operating profits declined in fiscal as a result of the timing of raw material cost increases and related customer price increases  expedited freight costs and temporary operating inefficiencies as we completed facility consolidations 
unfavorable mix  resulting from the mastervolt acquisition  also negatively impacted current year operating profit margins  despite the higher sales levels and lower incentive compensation costs 
fiscal compared to fiscal electrical segment net sales decreased by million to million in fiscal foreign currency rate changes favorably impacted fiscal sales by million 
excluding foreign currency rate changes  core sales declined for the year  reflecting lower demand in the first half of fiscal across all end markets  especially retail diy  commercial construction and utility markets 
electrical segment operating profit increased by million  to million for fiscal  including a million non cash asset impairment charge related to the harsh environment electrical business and million of incremental restructuring charges 
excluding these charges  the improvement in operating profit primarily reflected restructuring related cost savings as we realized the benefits of facility consolidations  reduced headcount and the movement of production and product sourcing to low cost countries 
engineered solutions segment the engineered solutions segment continued to see a rebound in demand from global heavy duty truck  construction equipment and other markets which resulted in higher sales levels 
as expected  year over year core sales growth moderated during the second half of fiscal  reflecting tougher fiscal comparables and the anniversary of prior year new vehicle launches 
the acquisition of weasler in june is expected to provide future sales and earnings growth opportunities for the segment  by expanding the product offerings primarily in the north american and european agricultural markets and providing increased aftermarket sales opportunities 
the following table sets forth the results of operations for the engineered solutions segment in millions year ended august  net sales operating profit loss operating profit fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in the engineered solutions segment increased by million from million for the year ended august  to million in the current year 
excluding the million of sales generated by the recent weasler acquisition and the impact of the weaker us dollar which favorably impacted fiscal sales by million  core sales growth was for fiscal the core sales growth reflects improved demand from vehicle oems in the global heavy duty truck  agriculture and construction equipment markets 
engineered solutions segment operating profit was million during fiscal and million in the prior year 
year over year operating profit comparisons are impacted by million of fiscal purchase accounting weasler charges and million of restructuring costs incurred in the prior year 
operating profit 
table of contents margin expansion was the result of increased manufacturing volume  continued productivity improvements and the benefits of previously completed restructuring actions  somewhat offset by higher incentive compensation costs and additional costs associated with growth initiatives 
fiscal compared to fiscal engineered solutions segment net sales increased by million to million for fiscal excluding the million favorable impact of foreign currency rate changes and sales from acquired businesses  core sales increased in fiscal the core sales increase was a result of a strong rebound in demand in the vehicle systems product line new automotive platforms  growth in china and europe truck shipments and substantially higher recreational vehicle oem production and the impact of prior year inventory destocking by oems 
engineered solutions segment operating profit increased by million from an operating loss of million in fiscal to an operating profit of million for fiscal the loss from operations in fiscal included a million non cash asset impairment charge related to the rv business and an incremental million of restructuring charges  relative to fiscal excluding these charges  operating profit improved during fiscal due to increased sales and production levels higher absorption of fixed manufacturing costs  favorable product mix  the benefits of completed restructuring activities and the favorable impact of foreign currency rate changes  which were partially offset by increased incentive compensation costs 
restructuring charges in fiscal  in response to the dramatic downturn in the worldwide economy  the company committed to various restructuring initiatives including workforce reductions  plant consolidations to reduce manufacturing overhead  the continued movement of production and product sourcing to low cost countries and the centralization of certain selling and administrative functions 
these actions were substantially completed by august   with limited restructuring activity and expense in fiscal  which primarily related to facility exit lease charges 
total restructuring costs were million  million and million for the years ended august   and  respectively 
we believe these restructuring actions better align our resources with strategic growth opportunities  optimize existing manufacturing capabilities  improve our overall cost structure and deliver increased free cash flow and profitability 
see note  restructuring in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on restructuring charges 
impairment charges significant adverse developments in the rv market during the first quarter of fiscal  including sharply lower wholesale motorhome shipments by oem s  decreased consumer confidence and the lack of financing available to rv dealers and retail customers negatively impacted the financial results of our rv business 
as a result  during the first quarter of fiscal  we recognized a million non cash impairment charge related to the goodwill and long lived assets of the rv business engineered solutions segment 
difficult economic conditions  low consumer confidence  increased unemployment and tight credit markets during the third quarter of fiscal also negatively impacted consumer discretionary spending  resulting in a substantial reduction in recreational boating industry sales 
during  many oem boat builders responded to the sharp drop in demand and high levels of finished goods inventory by temporarily suspending operations as well as eliminating brands and permanently closing facilities 
as a result  in the third quarter of fiscal  we recognized a million non cash asset impairment charge related to the goodwill  indefinite lived intangibles and long lived assets of the harsh environment electrical business electrical segment 
financing costs  net all debt is considered to be for general corporate purposes and therefore financing costs have not been allocated to our segments 
net financing costs were million for the years ended august  and 
table of contents and million for the year ended august  the million reduction in financing costs in fiscal  relative to fiscal  was the result of substantially lower average debt levels and reduced interest rates on variable rate debt 
income tax expense our income tax expense is impacted by a number of factors  including the amount of taxable earnings derived in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates that are lower than the us federal statutory rate  state tax rates in the jurisdictions where we do business  tax minimization planning and our ability to utilize various tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards 
the effective income tax rate for fiscal was  compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
the income tax expense recognized in fiscal and benefited from the utilization of foreign tax credits  increased taxable earnings in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates lower than the us statutory rate and favorable changes in valuation allowances  which were offset somewhat by unfavorable provision to return adjustments and additional provisions for unrecognized tax benefits 
the lower effective tax rate in fiscal is the result of the tax benefit on the impairment and restructuring charges being recognized at the domestic tax rate which is higher than our consolidated global effective tax rate and the benefit of income tax reserve adjustments resulting from settling tax audits for amounts less than previously accrued and the lapsing of various tax statutes of limitations 
discontinued operations discontinued operations reflects the results of the divested european electrical sold in fiscal  and acme aerospace and bh electronics  inc sold in fiscal businesses 
see note discontinued operations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
the following table summarizes the results of discontinued operations in millions year ended august  net sales net gain loss on disposal loss from operations of discontinued businesses income tax benefit expense loss from discontinued operations  net of income tax includes non cash asset impairment charges of million european electrical and million bh electronics in fiscal and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes the cash flow attributable to operating  investing and financing activities in millions year ended august  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
table of contents during fiscal we generated million of cash flow from operations reflecting improved earnings from continuing operations and effective working capital management 
we utilized the cash flow from operations  borrowings under our senior credit facility and the million of proceeds from the sale of the european electrical business to fund the million of capital deployed on the acquisitions of mastervolt and weasler and million of capital expenditures 
in fiscal  cash flows from operating activities were million 
excluding the million negative impact on working capital due to the expiration of our accounts receivable securitization program  net cash provided by operating activities increased relative to the prior year as a result of increased earnings from continuing operations  effective working capital management and the receipt of income tax refunds 
these operating cash flows and the million of proceeds from the sale of a portion of the european electrical product line in the second quarter of fiscal  funded million of acquisitions and million of capital expenditures  while reducing net debt by million 
effective cash flow management during fiscal resulted in substantial cash flow from operating activities of million and an improved financial position at august  operating cash flows benefited from lower working capital  given the decline in sales levels 
during fiscal  cash flows from operations  along with the million proceeds from a follow on equity offering and million of proceeds from the divestiture of two businesses  funded million of business acquisitions including the acquisition of the cortland companies  million of capital expenditures and a net reduction in debt of million 
primary working capital management we use primary working capital pwc as a percentage of sales as a key indicator of working capital management 
we define this metric as the sum of net accounts receivable and net inventory less accounts payable  divided by the past three months sales annualized 
the following table shows the components of the metric amounts in millions august  august  pwc pwc accounts receivable  net inventory  net accounts payable net primary working capital our net primary working capital percentage increased year over year from to as of august   primarily due to the fiscal acquisitions and a conscious effort to increase inventory levels in certain businesses to meet growing customer demand 
during fiscal  excluding acquisitions and changes in foreign currency exchange rates  accounts receivable decreased million and inventory increased million  while accounts payable increased million 
liquidity our senior credit facility  which was expanded and extended during the second quarter of fiscal  includes a million revolving credit facility  a million term loan and a million expansion option 
there are no required principal repayments under the term loan until march  at august   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of unused capacity on the revolver of which million was available for borrowings 
we believe that the remaining revolver availability combined with our existing cash on hand and anticipated operating cash flows will be adequate to meet operating  debt service  acquisition funding and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 

table of contents holders of our convertible notes have the option to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their convertible notes for cash on november  and november  at a price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued interest 
holders may also convert their convertible notes into shares of the company s class a common stock prior to the scheduled maturity date under certain conditions 
effective november  we have the ability to redeem all or part of the convertible notes for cash  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued interest 
see note  debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the senior credit facility and the convertible notes 
seasonality and working capital we have met our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through a combination of operating cash flow and availability under our senior credit facility 
although there are modest seasonal factors within certain of our businesses  on a consolidated basis  we do not experience material changes in seasonal working capital or capital resource requirements 
our receivables are derived from a diverse customer base in a number of industries 
we have no single customer which generated or more of fiscal net sales 
capital expenditures the majority of our manufacturing activities consist of the assembly of components which are sourced from a variety of vendors 
as a result  we believe that our capital expenditure requirements are not as extensive as many other industrial companies given the assembly nature of our operations 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
capital expenditures have historically been funded by operating cash flows 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be approximately million 
commitments and contingencies we lease certain facilities  computers  equipment and vehicles under various operating lease agreements  generally over periods ranging from one to twenty years 
under most arrangements  we pay the property taxes  insurance  maintenance and expenses related to the leased property 
many of the leases include provisions that enable us to renew the lease based upon fair value rental rates on the date of expiration of the initial lease 
see note  leases  in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the contractual obligations table below for further information 
we are contingently liable for certain lease agreements entered into by businesses that were part of our former electronics segment  which was spun off to shareholders in fiscal some of these businesses were subsequently sold to third parties 
if any of these businesses do not fulfill their obligations under the leases  we could be liable for such leases 
the present value of future minimum lease payments for these leases was million at august  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million at august  and  respectively  the majority of which secure self insured workers compensation liabilities 
off balance sheet arrangements as more fully discussed in note  accounts receivable securitization in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we were a party to an accounts receivable securitization arrangement under which we sold certain trade receivables to a wholly owned bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary  which in turn  sold 
table of contents participating interests in the receivables to a third party financial institution 
we did not renew the arrangement on its september  maturity date and  as a result  utilized availability under the senior credit facility to fund the corresponding million increase in accounts receivable 
contractual obligations the timing of payments due under our contractual commitments is as follows in millions payments due thereafter total long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases acquisition deferred purchase price the above table includes deferred purchase price and contingent consideration related to acquisitions completed in fiscal and previous years 
the contractual obligation schedule for long term debt assumes we do not call the remaining convertible notes or have them put back to us prior to their maturity date of november  our operating lease obligations generally relate to amounts due under contracts with third party service providers 
these contracts are primarily for real estate leases  information technology services including software and hardware support services and leases and telecommunications services 
those obligations that are not cancelable are included in the table 
we routinely issue purchase orders to numerous vendors for inventory and other supplies 
these purchase orders are generally cancelable with reasonable notice to the vendor  and as such  are excluded from the contractual obligations table 
we have long term obligations related to our deferred compensation  pension and postretirement plans at august  excluded from the contractual obligations table 
our liabilities related to these plans are summarized in note  employee benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in note  income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we have unrecognized tax benefits of million at august  the liability for unrecognized tax benefits was not included in the table of contractual obligations because the timing of the potential settlements of these uncertain tax positions cannot be reasonably estimated 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
this requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following policies are considered by management to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
inventory cost is determined using the last in  first out lifo method for a portion of us owned inventory approximately and of total inventories at august  and  respectively 
the first in  first out or average cost method is used for all other inventories 
if the lifo method were not used  the inventory balance would be higher than the amount in the consolidated balance sheet by approximately million at both august  and  respectively 

table of contents we perform an analysis of the historical sales usage of the individual inventory items on hand and a reserve is recorded to adjust inventory cost to market value 
the inventory valuation assumptions used are based on historical experience 
we believe that such estimates are made based on consistent and appropriate methods  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
goodwill and long lived assets goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we perform impairment reviews for our reporting units using a fair value method based on our judgments and assumptions 
the fair value represents the amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an arms length basis 
in estimating the fair value  we use a discounted cash flow model 
the estimated fair value is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
the annual impairment testing performed at august  indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its corresponding carrying amount and  as such  no impairment existed 
indefinite lived intangible assets are also subject to annual impairment testing 
the fair value of the indefinite lived assets  based on a relief of royalty model  are evaluated to determine if an impairment charge is required 
we also review long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
if such indicators are present  we perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists 
if an impairment is determined to exist  any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value 
refer to note  impairment charges in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on impairment charges recognized in fiscal and a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests  principally in determining the fair value of each reporting unit and the indefinite lived intangible assets 
while we believe our judgments and assumptions are reasonable  different assumptions could change the estimated fair values and  therefore  impairment charges could be required 
employee benefit plans we provide a variety of benefits to employees and former employees  including in some cases  pensions and postretirement health care 
plan assets and obligations are recorded based on an august measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates  assumed rates of return and health care cost trend rates 
we determine the discount rate assumptions by referencing high quality long term bond rates that are matched to the duration of our benefit obligations  with appropriate consideration of local market factors  participant demographics and benefit payment terms 
at august  and  the weighted average discount rate on domestic benefit plans was and  respectively 
in estimating the expected return on plan assets  we consider the historical returns on plan assets  forward looking considerations  inflation assumptions and the impact of the management of the plans invested assets 
domestic benefit plan assets consist primarily of participating units in common stock  index funds and bond funds 
the expected return on domestic benefit plan assets was and at august  and  respectively 
a basis point change in the assumptions for the discount rate or expected return on plan assets would not materially change fiscal domestic benefit plan expense 
we review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
as required by us gaap  the effects of the modifications are recorded currently or amortized over future periods 
based on information provided by independent actuaries and other relevant sources  we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable  however  changes in these assumptions could impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
see note  employee benefit plans in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
income tax expense also reflects best estimates and assumptions regarding  among other things  the level of future taxable income and the effect of various tax planning strategies 
future tax 
table of contents authority rulings and changes in tax laws  changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded 
use of estimates we record reserves or allowances for customer returns and discounts  doubtful accounts  inventory  incurred but not reported medical claims  environmental matters  warranty claims  workers compensation claims  product and non product litigation and incentive compensation 
these reserves require the use of estimates and judgment 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we believe that such estimates are made on a consistent basis and with appropriate assumptions and methods 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates
