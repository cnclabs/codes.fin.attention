item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis is related to our financial condition and results of operations for the three years ended december  this information should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto beginning on f of this form k 
statement of forward looking information certain statements in the section are forward looking statements 
you should read the information before item b above  special note regarding forward looking statements for more information about our presentation of information 
background we are a specialty pharmaceutical company based in philadelphia  pennsylvania and engaged in the clinical development of new drug therapies based on natural immune system enhancing technologies for the treatment of viral and immune based chronic disorders 
our flagship products include alferon n injection and the experimental therapeutics ampligen 
alferon n injection is approved for a category of std infection  and ampligen represents an experimental rna nucleic acids being developed for globally important viral diseases and disorders of the immune system 
hemispherx platform technology includes large and small agent components for potential treatment of various severely debilitating and life threatening diseases 
we have patents comprising our core intellectual property estate  a product alferon n injection and cgmp certified manufacturing facilities for our novel pharmaceutical products 
we have reported net income only from through since  we have incurred  as expected  substantial operating losses due to our conducting research and development programs 
fair value in connection with equity financings on may and   we issued warrants the warrants that are single compound derivatives containing both an embedded right to obtain stock upon exercise a call and a series of embedded rights to settle the warrants for cash upon the occurrence of certain events each  a put 
generally  the put provisions allow the warrant holders liquidity protection  the right to receive cash in certain situations where the holders would not have a means of readily selling the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants eg  where there would no longer be a significant public market for our common stock 
however because the contractual formula used to determine the cash settlement value of the embedded put requires use of certain assumptions  the cash settlement value of the embedded put can differ from the fair value of the unexercised embedded call option at the time the embedded put option is exercised 
specifically  the put rights would be triggered upon the happening of a fundamental transaction as defined below that also is an all cash transaction  a rule e transaction under the exchange act where the company would be taken private  or a transaction involving a person or entity not traded on a national securities exchange 
fundamental transactions include i a merger or consolidation of the company with or into another person or entity  ii a sale  lease  license  transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the company s assets  iii any purchase offer  tender offer or exchange offer in which holders of company common stock are permitted to sell  tender or exchange their shares for other securities  cash or property  which offer has been accepted by the holders of or more of the company s outstanding common stock  iv a reclassification  reorganization or recapitalization of the common stock pursuant to which the common stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities  cash or property  or v a stock purchase or other business combination with another person or entity is effected pursuant to which such other person or entity acquires more than of the outstanding shares of common stock 
pursuant to the warrants  the put rights enable the warrant holders to receive cash in the amount of the black scholes value is obtained from the ov function on bloomberg  lp bloomberg determined as of the day of consummation of the applicable fundamental transaction for pricing purposes and reflecting a a risk free interest rate corresponding to the us treasury rate for a period equal to the time between the date of the public announcement of the applicable fundamental transaction and the warrant expiration date  b an expected volatility equal to the greater of and the day volatility obtained from the hvt function on bloomberg as of the trading day immediately following the public announcement of the applicable fundamental transaction  c the underlying price per share used in such calculation shall be the sum of the price per share being offered in cash  if any  plus the value of any non cash consideration  if any  being offered in such fundamental transaction and d a remaining option time equal to the time between the date of the public announcement of the applicable fundamental transaction and the warrant expiration date 
the company recomputes the fair value of the warrants at the end of each quarterly reporting period 
such value computation includes subjective input assumptions that are consistently applied each period 
if the company were to alter its assumptions or the numbers input based on such assumptions  the resulting fair value could be materially different 
fair value at measurement dates during the period from warrants issuances at may   may  and may  to december  and  were estimated using the following assumptions underlying price per share exercise price per share risk free interest rate expected holding period years years expected volatility expected dividend yield none none the significant assumptions using the monte carlo simulation approach for valuation of the warrants are i risk free interest rate 
the risk free interest rates for the warrants are based on u 
s treasury constant maturities for periods commensurate with the remaining expected holding periods of the warrants 
ii expected holding period 
the expected holding period represents the period of time that the warrants are expected to be outstanding until they are exercised 
the company utilizes the remaining contractual term of the warrants at each valuation date as the expected holding period 
iii expected volatility 
expected stock volatility is based on daily observations of the company s historical stock values for a period commensurate with the remaining expected holding period on the last day of the period for which the computation is made 
iv expected dividend yield 
expected dividend yield is based on the company s anticipated dividend payments over the remaining expected holding period 
as the company has never issued dividends  the expected dividend yield is and this assumption will be continued in future calculations unless the company changes its dividend policy 
v expected probability of a fundamental transaction 
the possibility of the occurrence of a fundamental transaction triggering a put right is extremely remote 
as discussed above  a put right would only arise if a fundamental transaction is an all cash transaction  results in the company going private  or is a transaction involving a person or entity not traded on a national securities exchange 
the company believes such an occurrence is highly unlikely because a 
the company only has one product that is fda approved  b 
the company will have to perform additional clinical trials for fda approval of its flagship product  c 
industry and market conditions continue to include a global market recession  adding risk to any transaction  d 
available capital for a potential buyer in a cash transaction continues to be limited  e 
the nature of a life sciences company is heavily dependent on future funding and high fixed costs  including research development  f 
according to forbes 
com  of approximately  public companies  fewer than went private in and less than were completed in  representing and  respectively 
this would be further reduced based on the nature of a life sciences company and the potential lack of revenues  cash flows and the company s funding needs  and g 
the company rights agreement makes it less attractive to a potential buyer 
with the above factors utilized in analysis of the likelihood of the put potential liability  the company estimated the range of probabilities related to a put right being triggered as range of probability probability low medium high the monte carlo simulation incorporated a probability of a fundamental transaction 
vi expected timing of announcement of a fundamental transaction 
as the company has no specific expectation of a fundamental transaction  for reasons elucidated above  the company utilized a discrete uniform probability distribution over the expected holding period to model in the potential announcement of a fundamental transaction occurring during the expected holding period 
vii expected day volatility at announcement of a fundamental transaction 
an estimate of future volatility is necessary as there is no mechanism for directly measuring future stock price movements 
daily observations of the company s historical stock values for the days immediately prior to the warrants grant dates  with a floor of  were utilized as a proxy for the future volatility 
viii expected risk free interest rate at announcement of a fundamental transaction 
the company utilized a risk free interest rate corresponding to the forward us treasury rate for the period equal to the time between the date forecast for the public announcement of a fundamental transaction and the warrant expiration date for each simulation 
ix expected time between announcement and consummation of a fundamental transaction 
the expected time between the announcement and the consummation of a fundamental transaction is based on the company s experience with the due diligence process performed by acquirers  and is estimated to be six months 
the monte carlo simulation approach incorporates this additional period to reflect the delay warrant holders would experience in receiving the proceeds of the put 
results of operations year ended december  versus december  net loss our net loss of approximately  for the year ended december  was higher when compared to the same period in this  increase in loss was primarily due to increased research and development costs in of approximately  or as compared to the same period in  increased production cost of goods sold in of approximately  or  and increased general and administrative expenses of approximately  or as compared to the same period in  which increases were offset by an increase in interest and other income in of approximately  or  as compared to the same period in  a decrease in non cash financing costs of  in as compared to the same period in primarily due to the issuance of common stock purchase warrants in as part of the february standby financing agreement  and an adjustment at december  to record the change in fair value for a liability related to certain redeemable warrants issued in may this liability was recorded in may  adjusted and revalued to  at december   resulting in a related non cash gain of  in the value of this liability at december  was  the adjustment needed at december  to revalue the liability resulted in a related non cash gain of  at december  net loss per share for the year ended was approximately versus approximately as restated for the same period in revenues revenues from our ampligen cost recovery treatment program for the year ended december  were approximately  compared to revenues of  for the same period in  an increase of  or for approximately patients in and patients in participating in the program 
commercial sales of alferon n injection were halted in march when our finished goods inventory expired 
as a result  we had no alferon n injection product to commercially sell in or and all sales revenue in and has been generated from ampligen cost recovery clinical treatment programs 
in and  production of alferon n injection had been put on hold due to the resources needed to prepare our new brunswick facility for the fda preapproval inspection with respect to our ampligen nda 
we now have the financial resources to commence manufacturing upgrades that have been undertaken throughout and continue in see manufacturing in item business 
production cost of goods sold production cost of goods sold was approximately  and  respectively  for the twelve months ended december  and this represents an increase of  or as compared to the same period in the main cause for the increase in costs was the shrinkage of work in process due to restarting the manufacturing process and the resulting necessary additional testing of equipment  work in process and finished goods inventory for quality control 
the additional costs related to addressing manufacturing issues were approximately  the other expenses primarily represent additional costs to maintain alferon n injection and ampligen inventories including storage  stability testing  transport and reporting costs including ampligen nda work undertaken in research and development costs overall research and development costs for the year ended december  were approximately  as compared to  for the same period a year ago  reflecting an increase of  or 
the ampligen nda and related expenses were approximately  lower in primarily due to the scientific effort spent in on getting the nda prepared and filed 
research and development expenses related to alferon ldo had increased approximately  in due to our efforts in responding to the fda s clinical hold issues as well as implementing the influenza clinical trials in india 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses for the year ended december  and were approximately  and  respectively  reflecting an increase of  or 
the primary reasons for this increase in expense were an additional  in legal fees and services associated with our successful judgment against johannesburg consolidated investments along with our defense efforts in other legal proceedings see part i  item legal proceedings  an additional  in stock compensation to consultants and net increases in various other administrative expenses of  that were offset by a decrease in fees of  paid to the sage group 
interest and other income interest and other income for the year ended december  and was approximately  and  respectively  representing an increase of  or 
the primary cause for the increase of interest income in was the purchase of a diverse portfolio of short and long term investments that included the pimco mutual fund 
the interest income from these investments is recognized as the investments mature 
interest expense and financing costs in  we financed through capital leases some office equipment vital to the overall operations of the company as well as manufacturing equipment utilized in the production of alferon 
accordingly in  we had interest expense of approximately  as compared to for in february  we entered into a standby financing agreement that produced finance costs of  in common stock commitment warrants for the twelve months ended december  for which no agreement of this type was undertaken in for detailed information on this agreement  please see standby financing agreement below 
redeemable warrants valuation adjustment as a result of the adjustment to the valuation of the liability of the redeemable warrants issued in may for years ended december  and  a net gain of  was recorded in as compared to  recorded in results of operations year ended december  versus december  net loss our net loss of approximately  for the year ended december  was lower when compared to the same period in this  decrease in loss was primarily due to increased research and development costs in of approximately  or as compared to the same period in sales of alferon n injection for of approximately  compared to no sales recorded in decreased interest and other income in of approximately  or as compared to the same period in increased non cash financing costs of  in in the form of common stock commitment warrants issued as a result of the february implementation of the standby financing agreement 
no agreement of this type was in effect during decreased production cost of goods sold in of approximately  or and decreased general and administrative expenses of approximately  or as compared to the same period in an adjustment at december  to record the change in fair value for a liability related to the warrants issued in may this liability was recorded in may  adjusted and revalued to  at december   resulting in a related non cash gain of net loss per share for the year ended was compared to for the same period in revenues there were no revenues related to the sale of alferon n injection for the twelve month period ended while there were approximately  of sales for the same period of revenues from our ampligen cost recovery treatment program for the year ended december  were approximately  compared to revenues of  for the same period in  an increase of  or for approximately the same number of patients participating in the program 
commercial sales of alferon n injection were halted in march when our finished goods inventory expired 
as a result  we had no alferon n injection product to commercially sell in and all revenue in has been generated from ampligen cost recovery clinical treatment programs 
in and production of alferon n injection had been put on hold due to the resources needed to prepare our new brunswick facility for the fda preapproval inspection with respect to our ampligen nda 
we now have the financial resources to commence manufacturing upgrades that will be undertaken throughout production cost of goods sold production cost of goods sold was approximately  and  respectively  for the twelve months ended december  and this represents a decrease of  or as compared to the same period in these expenses primarily represent the costs to maintain alferon n injection and ampligen inventories including storage  stability testing  transport and reporting costs including ampligen nda work undertaken in additionally  there was a reduction in cost of goods sold for due to the lack of alferon n injection sales 
research and development costs overall research and development costs for the year ended december  were approximately  as compared to  for the same period a year ago reflecting an increase of  or 
s research and development costs include the write off of approximately  for patents that management either has not renewed the rights to or deemed no longer of value and or material to future operations 
additionally  research and development costs increased approximately  due to research and clinical employees participating in the employee wage or hour reduction program see liquidity and capital resources below for details  approximately  to evaluate and begin to ready the new brunswick plant for production and a net increase of  in comparing to expenses related to the efforts of employees in responding to the fda and issued bonus awards 
during and  we spent considerable time and effort preparing for the preapproval inspection by the fda of manufacturing of ampligen product and its raw materials  polynucleotides poly i and poly cu 
a satisfactory recommendation from the fda office of compliance based upon an acceptable preapproval inspection is required prior to approval of the product 
the preapproval inspection determines compliance with cgmp as well as a product specific evaluation concerning the manufacturing process of product 
the inspection includes many aspects of the cgmp requirements  such as manufacturing process validation  equipment qualification  analytical method validation  facility cleaning  quality systems  documentation system and part compliance 
in its november  crl  the fda described specific additional recommendations related to the ampligen nda 
the fda reviewers determined that they could not approve the application in its present form and provided specific recommendations to address the outstanding issues 
in september  we engaged lovelace respiratory research institute in albuquerque  new mexico  to perform certain animal toxicity studies in support of our ampligen nda 
these studies were requested by the fda and have been done in collaboration with the resources of the new brunswick facility 
on january   we submitted reports of new preclinical data regarding ampligen for potential treatment of cfs to the fda which we believe to be sufficient to address certain preclinical issues referenced in the crl 
the new preclinical data showed no evidence of antibodies against ampligen in primates and no evidence of an increase in certain undesirable cytokines specific modulators of the immune system at clinically used doses of ampligen for cfs 
although most other experimental immunomodulators have been associated with one or more features of aberrant immune activity  including toll like receptor activators of which ampligen is one  this was specifically not seen with ampligen in primates 
we are engaged in ongoing  experimental studies assessing the efficacy of ampligen  alferon n injection and alferon ldo against influenza viruses 
as a result  we have been focusing our resources on the studies being undertaken in japan and united states as well as the design of new alferon ldo studies for both prevention and treatment of seasonal or pandemic influenza 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses for the year ended december  and were approximately  and  respectively  reflecting a decrease of  or 
this decrease relates primarily to the effect of the cash conservation and cost reduction program implemented in january accordingly  areas of expenses were reduced including legal fees of approximately  stock compensation of approximately  accounting and related fees of approximately  a reduction in personnel costs of approximately  along with reduced expenses of approximately  related to discontinuation of sales of alferon 
these cost savings were somewhat offset by an increase of approximately  of incremental non cash labor expenses resulting from g a employees participating in the employee wage or hour reduction program along with an increase of approximately  in financial consulting  security filings and transfer fees  approximately  in costs related to the second round of stockholder voting and approximately  in professional advisor fees 
interest and other income interest and other income decreased approximately  or during the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in due to reduction of cash available to invest during the first five months of at lower interest rates 
while we received an infusion of cash from the two rodman deals in may  along with the receipt of additional cash from fusion capital in the third quarter of  historically low interest rates existed for conservative investments throughout interest expense and financing costs we had no interest expense for or in february  we entered into a standby financing agreement that produced finance costs of  in common stock commitment warrants for the twelve months ended december  for which no agreement of this type existed during the prior period in for detailed information on this agreement  please see standby financing agreement below 
redeemable warrants valuation adjustment as a result of the correction to the valuation of a liability related to warrants issued in may  a net gain of  was recorded in the monte carlo simulation approach was used to determine the fair value of this liability with regard to these warrants of  at their inception in may  increased by the losses from the exercised warrants in may and june of  and reduced by  for the exercised warrants 
at december  the fair value of this liability related to the unexercised warrants had decreased to  the net effect to reflect the change in the fair value of this liability during resulted in a gain of  the approximate combined losses of  from the exercised warrants and the gain of  from the fair value adjustment resulted in a net total non cash gain of  liquidity and capital resources cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the same period in  an increase of  we had proceeds from financing activities of approximately  compared to  during the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   we had approximately  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities or a decrease of approximately  from december  in an effort to conserve our cash  the employee wage or hours reduction program the program was ratified by our board effective january  in a mandatory program that was estimated to be in effect for up to six months  compensation of all active full time employees as of january  participants were reduced through a reduction in their wages for which they would be eligible to receive shares of our common stock stock six months after the shares were earned 
while all employees were also offered the option to reduce their work hours with a proportional decrease in wages  none elected this alternative 
the program was suspended as of may  with employees returning back to their rate of pay from january  at the passage of six months for each of their months of participation  non affiliate employees have been issued shares for the months ended july  august  september  october and november  individuals defined by rule in the securities act of as an affiliate receive their distribution of stock from the program in june and july in addition  certain vendors and service providers have agreed to accept shares of our common stock as partial payment of their bills 
we issued  and  shares of common stock for services rendered in and  respectively 
we have been using the proceeds from our financings with the assistance of rodman renshaw  llc rodman as placement agent and from fusion capital fund ii  llc fusion capital equity financing to fund operating expense and infrastructure growth including preparation for manufacturing  regulatory compliance and market development costs related to the fda approval process for ampligen 
during  we raised in the aggregate approximately  in equity financing pursuant to the two rodman financings in may and an aggregate of approximately  in equity financing pursuant to the fusion capital agreement 
for more details on the rodman and fusion capital financings  please see equity financing below 
because of our long term capital requirements  we may seek to access the public equity market whenever conditions are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time 
we are unable to estimate the amount  timing or nature of future sales of outstanding common stock or instruments convertible into or exercisable for our common stock 
any additional funding may result in significant dilution and could involve the issuance of securities with rights  which are senior to those of existing stockholders 
we may also need additional funding earlier than anticipated  and our cash requirements  in general  may vary materially from those now planned  for reasons including  but not limited to  changes in our research and development programs  clinical trials  competitive and technological advances  the regulatory processes  including the commercializing of ampligen products 
notwithstanding our cost and spending reduction activities  we may need to raise additional funds through additional equity or debt financing or from other sources in order to complete the necessary clinical trials and the regulatory approval processes including the commercializing of ampligen products 
there can be no assurances that we will raise adequate funds from these or other sources  especially considering current adverse market conditions  which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop our products 
any additional funding may result in significant dilution and could involve the issuance of securities with rights  which are senior to those of existing stockholders 
we may also need additional funding earlier than anticipated  and our cash requirements  in general  may vary materially from those now planned  for reasons including  but not limited to  changes in our research and development programs  clinical trials  competitive and technological advances  the regulatory process  and higher than anticipated expenses and lower than anticipated revenues from certain of our clinical trials for which cost recovery from participants has been approved 
our ability to raise additional funds from the sale of equity securities is limited 
in this regard  we only have approximately  shares authorized but unissued and unreserved 
we were unable to gather the requisite votes at our annual stockholders meeting held on june  to amend our certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from  to  since we have not been able to obtain approval to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock  the amount of proceeds we may receive from the sale of our remaining common stock is limited 
standby financing agreement in february  we entered into a standby financing agreement pursuant to which certain individuals individuals  consisting of dr 
william carter and thomas equels  agreed to loan us up to an aggregate of  in funds should we be unable to obtain additional financing  if needed 
under the standby financing agreement  we would use our best efforts in to obtain one or more additional financing agreements on such terms as our board deems to be reasonable and appropriate in order to maintain our operations 
if at any time after december  and prior to june  a majority of our independent directors deems that in the event a financing of at least million has not been obtained and additional funds are needed to maintain our operations  we would send written notice to each of the individuals informing them of the total amount of additional funds required and the specific amount that would be required from each individual 
such funding as prescribed by the agreement was obtained in may for agreeing to be obligated to loan us money  each individual received year warrants the commitment warrants to purchase our common stock at the rate of  worth in warrants per  committed 
the exercise price of these warrants is of the market closing price of our common stock on the date that agreement was executed 
these warrants vested immediately 
equity financing on may   we entered into a letter agreement with rodman renshaw  llc rodman as placement agent  relating to a proposed offering of our securities 
the proceeds from the may and  equity transactions are net of all related offering costs  including the fair value of warrants issued 
on may   we entered into securities purchase agreements with two institutional investors 
pursuant to the securities purchase agreements  we issued to these investors in the aggregate a  shares of our common stock  b series i warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share series i warrants  and c series ii warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share series ii warrants  and together with the series i warrants  the warrants 
the series i warrants could be exercised at any time on or after the six month anniversary of the may  closing date of the offering and for a five year period thereafter 
the series ii warrants could be exercised at any time on or after the may  date of delivery of the series ii warrants and for a period of days thereafter 
the outstanding warrants include a cash settlement feature if certain conditions are met 
as of december   all series ii warrants were exercised and none of the series i warrants have been exercised 
rodman  as placement agent for the may  securities purchase agreements  received series i warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock equal at an exercise price of per share 
the series i warrants can be exercised at any time on or after the six month anniversary of the may  closing date of the offering and for a five year period thereafter 
the warrants include a cash settlement feature if certain conditions are met 
rodman also was entitled to a fee equal to of the series ii warrants that were exercised 
in  rodman received  in fees with regard to the exercise of the series ii warrants 
the outstanding warrants include a cash settlement feature if certain conditions are met 
as of december   none of the series i warrants have been exercised 
on may   we entered into securities purchase agreements with two institutional investors 
pursuant to the securities purchase agreements  we issued to these investors in the aggregate a  shares of common stock  and b warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock at an exercise price per share warrants

as of december   none of the warrants have been exercised 
refer to note fair value under notes to consolidated financial statements for further explanation of the warrants in these agreements 
the warrants include a cash settlement feature if certain conditions are met 
on july   we entered into a million common stock purchase agreement the purchase agreement with fusion capital fund ii  llc fusion capital  an illinois limited liability company 
concurrently with entering into the purchase agreement  we entered into a registration rights agreement with fusion capital 
under the registration rights agreement  we filed a registration statement related to the transaction with the us securities exchange commission sec covering the shares that have been issued or may be issued to fusion capital under the common stock purchase agreement 
that registration statement was declared effective by the sec on august  as reported in the registration statement related to the transaction  we had the right over a month period from august to sell our shares of common stock to fusion capital from time to time in amounts between  and million depending on certain conditions as set forth in the agreement  up to a maximum of million 
the purchase price of the shares related to the million of future funding was based on the prevailing market prices of our shares at the time of sales as computed under the purchase agreement without any fixed discount  and we had control of the timing and amount of any sales of shares to fusion capital 
however  fusion capital could not purchase any shares of our common stock pursuant to the purchase agreement if the price of our common stock had three trading days with an average value below over the prior twelve trading days 
there were no negative covenants  restrictions on future funding  penalties or liquidated damages in the agreement 
in consideration for entering into the purchase agreement  we issued to fusion capital  shares as a commitment fee 
also  we were to issue to fusion capital up to an additional  shares as a commitment fee pro rata as we receive up to the million of future funding 
as of september   fusion capital had purchased the maximum number of shares that were registered under the registration statement  an aggregate of  shares for  and received  commitment shares  thereby in effect exhausting the purchasing agreement 
consistent with section k iv  we formally terminated the purchase agreement on april  pursuant to our may  equity distribution agreement the agreement with maxim group llc maxim we established an at the market atm equity program pursuant to which we may sell up to  shares of our common stock from time to time through maxim as our sales agent the agent 
under the agreement  the agent is entitled to a commission at a fixed commission rate of of the gross sales price per share sold  up to aggregate gross proceeds of  and  thereafter  at a fixed commission rate of of the gross sales price per share sold 
we have no obligation to sell any shares under this program  and may at any time terminate the agreement 
during the fiscal quarters ended september  and december   we sold no shares through this program and received no net cash proceeds 
as of december   we sold  shares through the atm that resulted in net cash proceeds of  and commissions paid to maxim of  because of our long term capital requirements  we may seek to access the public equity market through the above atm equity program or otherwise whenever conditions are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time 
we are unable to estimate the amount  timing or nature of future sales of outstanding common stock or instruments convertible into or exercisable for our common stock 
any additional funding may result in significant dilution and could involve the issuance of securities with rights  which are senior to those of existing stockholders 
we may also need additional funding earlier than anticipated  and our cash requirements  in general  may vary materially from those now planned  for reasons including  but not limited to  changes in our research and development programs  clinical trials  competitive and technological advances  the regulatory processes  including the commercializing of ampligen and new utilization of alferon products 
our ability to raise funds from the sale of equity is limited due to the limited number of shares of common stock authorized but not issued or reserved please see part i  item a 
risk factors  we may require additional financing which may not be available  the limited number of shares of common stock available for financing or other purposes may hinder our ability to raise additional funding or utilize equity securities for other corporate purposes 
the proceeds from our financing have been used to fund infrastructure growth including manufacturing  regulatory compliance and market development 
there can be no assurances that  if needed  we will raise adequate funds from these or other sources  which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop our products 
also  we have the ability to curtail discretionary spending  including some research and development activities  if required to conserve cash 
dollars in thousands obligations expiring by period contractual cash obligations total operating leases total new accounting pronouncements refer to note h recent accounting standards and pronouncements under notes to consolidated financial statements 
disclosure about off balance sheet arrangements none 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are most critical to aid in fully understanding our reported financial results are the following revenue revenue from the sale of ampligen under cost recovery clinical treatment protocols approved by the fda is recognized when the treatment is provided to the patient 
revenues from the sale of product are recognized when the product is shipped  as title is transferred to the customer 
we have no other obligation associated with our products once shipment has occurred 
inventories we use the lower of first in  first out fifo cost or market method of accounting for inventory 
patents and trademarks patents and trademarks are stated at cost primarily legal fees and are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of years 
we review our patents and trademark rights periodically to determine whether they have continuing value 
such review includes an analysis of the patent and trademark s ultimate revenue and profitability potential 
in addition  management s review addresses whether each patent continues to fit into our strategic business plans 
stock based compensation under fasb asc compensation stock compensation asc share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
we adopted the provisions of asc  using a modified prospective application 
under this method  compensation cost is recognized for all share based payments granted  modified or settled after the date of adoption  as well as for any unvested awards that were granted prior to the date of adoption 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option valuation model 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the price of our common stock 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury issues with a term equal to the expected life of the option 
we use uses historical data to estimate expected dividend yield  expected life and forfeiture rates 
redeemable warrants we utilize the guidance contained asc formerly sfas in the determination of whether to record warrants and options as equity and or liability 
if the guidance of asc is deemed inconclusive  we continue our analysis utilizing asc formerly eitf 
our method of recording the related value attempts to be consistent with the standards as defined by the financial accounting standards board utilizing the concept of fair value from asc that states that any fair value measurement requires that the reporting entity to determine the valuation technique s appropriate for the measurement  considering the availability of data with which to develop inputs that represent the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the inputs fall 
we recomputed the value of the redeemable warrants at the end of each quarterly period 
we use the monte carlo simulation approach which includes subjective input assumptions that are consistently applied each quarter 
if we were to alter our assumptions or the numbers input based on such assumptions  the resulting fair value could be materially different 
as discussed in greater detail in fair value at the beginning of this item  the significant assumptions using this model are i risk free interest rate  ii expected holding period  iii expected volatility  iv expected dividend yield  v expected probability of a fundamental transaction  vi expected timing of announcement of a fundamental transaction  vii expected day volatility at announcement of a fundamental transaction  viii expected risk free interest rate at announcement of a fundamental transaction  and ix expected time between announcement and consummation of a fundamental transaction 
concentration of credit risk our policy is to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution and place investments with financial institutions evaluated as being credit worthy  or in short term money markets  which are exposed to minimal interest rate and credit risks 
at and since december   we have had bank deposits and overnight repurchase agreements that exceed federally insured limits

our receivables historically consisted principally of amounts due from wholesale drug companies 
at both december  and there were no receivables 
there were no sales for years ended december  and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we had approximately  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  to the extent that our cash and cash equivalents exceed our near term funding needs  we intend to invest the excess cash in money market accounts or three to eighteen month financial instruments 
we employ established conservative policies and procedures to manage any risks with respect to investment exposure
