sales of strategic gas products sold through the distribution business segment in the current year increased from the prior year 
among strategic gas products  bulk gas sales were up as bulk sales to industrial manufacturing and petrochemical customers continued to recover  and bulk nitrogen for food freezing applications continued to show strength 
sales of medical gases were up as a result of new business signings  partially offset by a reduction in elective and non critical medical procedures  which reduced overall demand 
sales of specialty gases were up driven primarily by higher volumes and increased demand for core specialty gases 
the rising demand for the company s core specialty gases reflects further strengthening of the company s market position in epa protocols and other calibration gas mixtures  improving conditions in petrochemical markets and spot sales of certain rare gases in the fiscal second quarter 
contributing to the rise in distribution business segment hardgoods same store sales were increases in both safety products and the company s radnor private label brand product line

among strategic gas products  bulk gas sales were down due to the impact of production slowdowns in the metal fabrication and steel customer segments  as well as reduced activity from oil field service customers 
the decline in bulk gas sales related to these customer segments was partially offset by growth in sales of bulk nitrogen for food freezing applications 
sales of medical gases grew as a result of new business signings  which were partially offset by slowing in overall demand for medical gases used in elective and non critical medical procedures

the company does not believe it is at risk for non performance by its counterparties 
however  if an interest rate swap is in an asset position  the failure of one or more of its counterparties would result in an increase in interest expense and a reduction of earnings 
the company compares its fair value calculations to the fair values calculated by the counterparties for each swap agreement for reasonableness
