item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations current environment beginning in the summer of  significant adverse changes in financial market conditions resulted in a deleveraging of the entire global financial system 
as part of this process  residential and commercial mortgage markets in the united states have experienced a variety of difficulties including loan defaults  credit losses and reduced liquidity 
in response to these unprecedented events  the us government has taken a number of actions to improve stability in the financial markets and encourage lending 
one such program is the troubled assets relief program  or tarp 
on july   president obama signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act or the dodd frank act 
the dodd frank act provides for new regulations on financial institutions and creates new supervisory and advisory bodies  including the new consumer financial protection bureau 
the dodd frank act tasks many agencies with issuing a variety of new regulations  including rules related to mortgage origination and servicing  securitization and derivatives 
as the dodd frank act has only recently been enacted and because a significant number of regulations have yet to be proposed  it is not possible for us to predict how the dodd frank act will impact our business 
on february   we notified the us department of the treasury that our board of directors determined that the payment of the quarterly cash dividend of thousand due during the first quarter of  and subsequent quarterly payments on the fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a  should be deferred 
the total arrearage on such preferred stock as of december  is thousand 
this amount has been accrued for in our consolidated financial statements 
impact of income tax valuation we determined that a million valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset is required as of december  we decided to establish a valuation allowance during the third quarter against the deferred tax asset because it is uncertain when we will realize this asset 
the valuation allowance does not impact our tier one capital for regulatory purposes because net deferred tax assets are already excluded from that calculation 
factors impacting our operating results in addition to the prevailing market conditions  we expect that the results of our operations will be affected by a number of factors and will primarily depend on  among other things  the level of our net interest income  the market value of our assets and the supply of  and demand for  commercial and residential mortgage loans  commercial real estate debt  mortgage backed securities and other financial assets in the marketplace 
our net interest income includes the actual payments we receive and is also impacted by the level of loans that are not accruing interest due to their delinquency level 
our net interest income varies over time  primarily as a result of changes in interest rates  volume and levels of interest earning assets and interest paying deposits and liabilities 
 interest rates vary according to the type of asset  conditions in the financial markets  credit worthiness of our borrowers  competition and other factors  none of which can be predicted with any certainty 
our operating results may also be impacted by credit losses in excess of the amounts that we have provided for at december  credit risk 
we may be exposed to various levels of credit risk  depending on the nature of our underlying assets 
our loan committee will approve and monitor credit risk and other risks associated with our loan portfolio and our asset liability committee alco will approve and monitor credit risk associated with our investment portfolio 
our board of directors monitors credit risk through their monthly board of directors meetings 
amount of earning assets 
the amount of our earning assets  as measured by the aggregate unpaid principal balance of our loan and our investment portfolios  is a key revenue driver 
during  we have strategically decreased the balances of our investment portfolio and borrowings and certificates of deposits in order to improve our capital position 
generally  as the size of our earning assets decrease  the amount of interest income we receive decreases 
the reduction in earning assets also helps to lower interest expense as we incur less interest expense from certificates of deposits to finance the earning assets 
however  the decline in our interest income has been greater than the decrease in our interest expense which  in total  reduces our net interest income 

table of contents changes in market interest rates 
with respect to our business operations  increases in interest rates  in general  may over time cause the interest expense associated with our borrowings to increase  the value of our fixed rate investment securities to decline  the interest expense associated with our variable rate deposits to increase  coupons on our variable rate loans to reset  although on a delayed basis  to higher interest rates to the extent allowed by individual loan floors and caps  and to the extent applicable under the terms of our assets  prepayments on our mortgage loan portfolio and mortgage backed securities to slow thus increasing the duration of these assets 
conversely  decreases in interest rates  in general  may over time cause to the extent applicable under the terms of our assets  prepayments on our mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities to increase thus shortening the duration of these assets  the interest expense associated with our variable rate deposits and borrowings to decrease  the value of our fixed rate investment securities to increase  and coupons on our adjustable rate loans to reset  although on a delayed basis  to lower interest rates subject to interest rate floors on the individual loan 
since changes in interest rates may significantly affect our activities  our operating results depend  in large part  upon our ability to effectively manage interest rate risks 
results of operations for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million 
after the accrued  but unpaid dividend of million to the treasury on preferred stock  the net loss to common shareholders was million 
on a per share basis  the net loss was per common share while the return on average assets and return on average equity was and respectively 
the loss in was primarily due to the addition of million in provisions for future loan losses given the level of non performing loans and a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million 
also impacting the loss in was a decrease of million in interest income due to increasing non performing loans  decreasing interest rates and a decline in interest earning assets total assets declined million at december  to million from million at december  total cash and cash equivalents increased million to million as total deposits decreased million  total loans decreased million  securities available for sale decreased million  and total borrowings decreased million from million in to million in the decrease in deposits is primarily due to a decline in our certificates of deposit as we have continued to lower deposit interest rates 
funds received from the sale  maturity  and calls of investment securities allowed us to pay down our borrowings by million 
at december   the book value of a share of common stock was compared to at december  for the year ended december  we reported a net loss of million compared to a net loss of million reported for the year ended december   a decline of million or

interest income on securities decreased million from million in to million in due to a shift in our investment mix towards lower yielding and lower regulator y capital risk weighted gnma and us treasury securities 
this shift to zero percent risk weighted investments was done in order to reduce risk weighted assets  improve our risk based capital ratio and to improve the credit quality of the portfolio 
as the yields on loans and investments were decreasing  so too were the rates paid on deposits 
interest expense on deposits decreased million or in compared to the yield on deposits was in compared to in interest expense on borrowings decreased million from million in to million in while the cost of these funds increased from in to in

it represents the difference between interest income with any non taxable interest adjusted to a fully tax equivalent basis  including net deferred loan fees earned  and interest expense  on both deposits  and borrowings reflected as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis for was million a decline of or versus million in the full year fte net interest margin was compared to for the full year of this was primarily due to an increase in non accrual loans  variable rate loans repricing downward and calls being made on many higher yielding agency securities

this offset a decline in the earnings from the title insurance subsidiary 
non interest expenses 
non interest expense totaled million in compared to million  a decrease of million or 
salary and benefit expense decreased by million in primarily due to management driven headcount reductions 
the loss on otti write down of securities totaled thousand in compared to million in due to improving credit markets which have not led to new material otti impairments on our cdo securities 
legal  professional and consulting fees increased thousand or primarily related to increased fees associated with our written agreement with the federal reserve and virginia bureau of financial institutions and regulatory compliance

this is primarily due to a special assessment of  expensed in the second quarter as well as premium rate increases in in addition  data processing is a new expense category in  which represents our change in late to an outsourced arrangement for data processing  replacing an in house syste m 
previously  comparable expenses would have been in salaries and wages  pensions and benefits  equipment depreciation  and equipment repairs and maintenance 
each of these categories decreased in  partially due to this new arrangement

income taxes 
we reported income tax expense of million in and a benefit of million in  and a benefit of million in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of the establishment of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset 
the effective tax rate benefit is the result of the write down of other than temporary impairment on securities  increased fdic premiums  and lower net interest income 
the effective tax rate benefit is the result of the loss suffered due to the write off of our gse and lehman investments 
table of contents during management assesses the realizability of the deferred tax asset on a quarterly basis  considering both positive and negative evidence in determining whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the gross deferred tax asset would not be realized 
during the third quarter  management conducted such an analysis and determined that an establishment of a valuation allowance of million was prudent given our historical losses 
management determined that a valuation allowance was still required as of december  there is no impact on our calculation of tier one capital for regulatory purposes given the net deferred tax assets were already excluded from the calculation 
financial condition loan portfolio 
we actively extend consumer loans to individuals and commercial loans to small and medium sized businesses within our primary service area 
our commercial lending activity extends across our primary service area of powhatan  cumberland  eastern goochland county  western chesterfield  and western henrico counties 
consistent with our focus on providing community based financial services  we generally do not attempt to diversify our loan portfolio geographically by making significant amounts of loans to borrowers outside of our primary service area 
the principal economic risk associated with each of the categories of loans in our portfolio is the creditworthiness of our borrowers 
within each category  such risk is increased or decreased depending on prevailing economic conditions 
the risk associated with the real estate mortgage loans and installment loans to individuals varies based upon employment levels  consumer confidence  fluctuations in value of residential real estate and other conditions that affect the ability of consumers to repay indebtedness 
the risk associated with commercial  financial and agricultural loans varies based upon the strength and activity of the local economies of our market areas 
the risk associated with real estate construction loans varies based upon the supply of and demand for the type of real estate under construction 
m any of our real estate construction loans are for pre sold or contract homes 
builders are limited as to the number and dollar amount of loans for speculative home construction based on the financial strength of the borrower and the prevailing market conditions

instead those loans which met the bank s underwriting criteria were recorded on the bank s books as mortgage loans 
in addition  most of these loans were and year fixed rate loans  which given the composition of bank s portfolio of mortgage loans being mostly and year adjustable rate loans  the addition of fixed rate loans was desirable from an asset liability standpoint at a time when interest rates were flat and expected to trend down in the future 
as a percentage of total real estate loans  construction loans comprised in  in  in  in  and in considering the c urrent state of the real estate market for new home sales  we anticipate that our construction loan portfolio will remain at approximately the same volume or will decline in the future 
substantially all construction loans are for residential construction in our principal market areas 
effective january   the company ceased the origination of residential mortgage loans 
in addition  based on the requirements of the written agreement with the bureau of financial institutions and the federal reserve  the company is not actively seeking acquisition  development  or construction loans  however  the company may consider such a loan on a limited basis 
installment loans decreased by million or in  decreased by million or in  decreased by thousand or in  and increased by thousand or in the balances of traditional installment loans declined primarily due to reduced demand resulting from the current economic environment 
installment loans increased in due to our emphasis on loan growth  however over the past several years  the balances have dropped principally due to our unwillingness to effectively compete on an interest rate basis with the captive and other finance arms of the major automobile manufacturers  coupled with the tendency of consumers to utilize equity credit lines for purposes that in the past would have been financed with traditional installment loans 
we anticipate this atmosphere su rrounding installment lending to continue in the future as long as the automobile manufacturers effectively subsidize the sale of vehicles through offering below market financing

asset quality 
non performing loans include non accrual loans  loans days or more past due and restructured loans 
non accrual loans are loans on which interest accruals have been discontinued 
loans which reach non accrual status  per company policy  may not be restored to accrual status until all delinquent principal and interest has been paid  or the loan becomes both well secured and in the process of collection 
restructured loans are loans with respect to which a borrower has been granted a concession on the interest rate or the original repayment terms because of financial difficulties 
management forecloses on delinquent real estate loans when all other repayment possibilities have been exhausted 
the bank s practice is to value real estate acquired through foreclosure at the lower of i an independent current appraisal or market analysis less anticipated costs of disposal  or ii the existing loan balance 
the following table summarizes activity related to other real estate owned at december  dollars in thousands acquired real estate through foreclosure net oreo related expenses management is diligently monitoring the increase in non performing assets  however  it does believe that the level of non performing loans in is a reflection of the current depressed real estate markets and the generally weak economic environment 
based on our present knowledge of the status of individual and corporate borrowers and the overall state of the local economy  management reasonably anticipates that the level of non performing assets is likely to decrease from its current level 
management will move to foreclose on borrowers whose loans are placed on a non accrual status in order to resolve the credit therefore it is reasonable to anticipate an increase in oreo

our policy with respect to past due interest on nonaccrual loans requires that any interest accrued in the current year and unpaid should be reversed from the receivable and current year s income 
with regard to interest accrued in the prior year  and yet unpaid  such accrued interest should be reversed from the receivable and reserve for loan losses 
since we operate in a rural to suburban area  we have generally been well acquainted with our principal borrowers and have not had such a large number of problem credits that management has not been able to stay well informed about  and in contact with  troubled borrowers 
management is not aware of any other material loans at december   which involve significant doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with their existing payment terms

loans  including non performing loans are monitored on an ongoing basis as part of our periodic loan review process 
management reviews the adequacy of its loan loss allowance at the end of each month 
based primarily on our loan risk classification system  which classifies all commercial loans  including problem credits according to a scale of with being a loss  additional provisions for losses may be made monthly 
in addition  we evaluate the general market credit risks inherent in lending  as well as any systemic issues  as part of our enhanced loan lo ss adequacy analysis 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to provide for future losses 
the ratio of the allowance to non performing loans decreased from due to some of our non performing loans already having partial charge offs associated with them 
management evaluates non performing loans relative to their collateral value and makes appropriate reductions in the carrying value of those loans based on that review

management evaluates the loan portfolio in light of local business and economic conditions  changes in the nature and value of the portfolio  industry standards and other relevant factors 
assumptions and factors considered by management in determining the amounts charged to operations include internally generated loan review reports  previous loan loss experience with the borrower  the status of past due interest and principal payments on the loan  the quality of financial information supplied by the borrower and the general financial condition of the borrower 
despite management s best efforts  the reserve may be adjusted in future periods if there are significant changes in the assumptions or factors utilized when making valuations  or conditions differ materially from the assumptions originally utilized 
any such adjustments are made in the reporting period when the relevant factor s become known and when applied as part of the analysis indicate a change in the level of potential loss is warranted 

table of contents for the year ended december   the provision for loan losses was million and in the provision for loan losses was million 
the primary driver of the charge offs were the real estate construction loans 
we have seen the underlying development projects related to these loans delayed as the real estate market has deteriorated 
there was a million provision for loan losses for the year ended december   a thousand provision for loan losses for the year ended december   and in there was no loan provision 
in management s opinion  the provision charged to operations has been sufficient to absorb the current year s net loan losses and generally provide a reserve for potential future loan losses considering the financial condition of borrowers and collateral values in view of the uncertainties in our local economy 
the following table shows the balance and percentage of our allowance for loan losses allocated to each category of loans at december  reserve for loan losses percentage of reserve for loan losses percentage of loans category to total loans reserve for loan losses percentage of reserve for loan losses percentage of loans category of total loans reserve for loan losses percentage of reserve for loan losses percentage of loans category of total loans dollars in thousands commercial real estate construction real estate mortgage consumer at december  reserve for loan losses percentage of reserve for loan losses percentage of loans category to total loans reserve for loan losses percentage of reserve for loan losses percentage of loans category of total loans dollars in thousands commercial real estate construction real estate mortgage consumer includes home equity loans

we have allocated the allowance according to the amount deemed to be reasonably necessary to provide for the possibility of losses being incurred within each of the above categories of loans 
the allocation of the allowance as shown in the table above should not be interpreted as an indication that loan losses in future years will occur in the same proportions or that the allocation indicates future loss trends 
furthermore  the portion allocated to each loan category may vary from period to period due to changes in the financial ability of borrowers to service their debt and repay principal  changes in the estimated value of collateral  in particular real estate 
these allocations are not necessarily the total amount available for future losses that might occur within such categories  since a portion of the total allowance is a general allowance applicable to the entire portfolio 

table of contents securities our investment securities portfolio serves several purposes  primarily  liquidity  safety and yield 
certain of the securities are pledged to secure public deposits and others are specifically identified as collateral for borrowing from the federal home loan bank of atlanta  and others for repurchase agreements with correspondent banks and commercial customers 
the remaining portion of the portfolio is held for investment yield  availability for sale in the event liquidity is needed  and for general asset liability management purposes 
at december   investment securities totaled million representing of total assets and a decrease of million or compared to million in the largest decreases occurred in the government agencies category  and the corporate and other debt category as we shifted our mix of securities into investments with less risk associated with them  such as ginnie mae mortgage backed securities and us treasury securities

at december   investment securities totaled million representing of total assets and a decrease of million or compared to million in the majority of this decrease occurred in the government agencies category as over million of these securities were called during while the net of purchases and sales was a positive million as we sought to replace the yield on the securities called 
for the total portfolio in  million in securities were called  net purchases and sales were a positive million  paydowns and maturities were million  and million was written down as otti 
we review and evaluate all securities quarterly or more frequently as necessary for possible impairment 
if  in the judgment of management  there is serious doubt as to the probability of collecting substantially all our basis in a security within a reasonable period of time  an impairment write down will be recognized 
we conducted impairment reviews as of december for all securities where cash flow information was obtainable 
our analysis indicated that we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security 
we also determined that we would not be required to sell the securities before the recovery of the entire amortized cost basis of the security

additionally  we hold eleven cdo securities where the underlying pooled collateral is various bank and insurance company trust preferred debt 
other than temporary impairment otti in the amount of thousand has been recognized on seven of these securities in subsequent to purchase  seven of these securities have revised ratings that are below minimum investment grade refer to note of the financial statements for further discussion 
we use an independent valuation firm that specializes in valuing debt securities 
the independent firm evaluates all relevant credit and structural aspects of each debt security  determining appropriate performance assumptions and performing discounted cash flow analysis 
 the following topics are covered in their evaluation detailed credit and structural evaluation for each piece of collateral in the debt security  collateral performance projections for each piece of collateral in the debt security  terms of the debt security structure  and discounted cash flow modeling 
following the quarterly evaluation of these securities  management has concluded that  with the exception of the previously noted non cash charge  the impairment within the cdo securities is considered temporary as of december  we do not own any securities collateralized by sub prime or alt a mortgage loans 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded thousand in other than temporary impairment charges 
we determined this based on our estimate of credit losses on the related securities

table of contents capital resources the assessment of capital adequacy depends on a number of factors such as asset quality  liquidity  earnings performance and changing competitive conditions and economic forces 
we seek to maintain a strong capital base to provide stability to current operations and to promote public confidence 
in addition  the company is evaluating strategies regarding capital enhancements 
such strategies could include capital offerings  a sale leaseback of bank owned real estate  continued reduction in assets  or further management of the securities portfolio 
the bank was considered adequately capitalized for regulatory purposes as of december  the primary indicators relied on by the federal reserve board and other bank regulators in measuring strength of capital position are the tier capital  total capital  and leverage ratios 
tier capital consists of common and qualifying preferred stockholders equity and minority interests in common equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill 
total capital consists of tier capital  qualifying subordinated debt  some hybrid capital instruments and other qualifying preferred stock and a limited amount of the allowance for loan losses and pre tax net unrealized holding gains on certain equity securit ies 
risk based capital ratios are calculated with reference to risk weighted assets  which consist of both on and off balance sheet risks 
the following tables show risk based capital ratios and stockholders equity to total assets for the company and its principal subsidiary  central virginia bank december  regulatory minimum consolidated for capital adequacy purposes total risk based capital tier risk based capital leverage ratio stockholders equity to total assets n a central virginia bank adequately capitalized well capitalized total risk based capital tier risk based capital leverage ratio the capital management function is an ongoing process 
central to this process is internal equity generation accomplished by retaining earnings 
the losses incurred in  and have reduced the capital such that it is now considered adequately capitalized 
at december   total stockholders equity decreased by million to million principally due to the recordation of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the primary reason for the decrease in the bank s capital ratio is due to the pretax net loss for the deferred tax asset valuation allowance is not considered in the capital ratios calculation 
total stockholders equity increased million to million in from million in principally due to the iss uance of preferred shares in january total stockholders equity decreased by million to million in from million in principally due to write down  net of tax  of the gse and lehman brothers securities and an increase in the unrealized securities losses  net of tax  reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
total stockholders equity decreased by million to million in from million principally due to an increase in the unrealized securities losses  net of tax  reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
due to the impact on the bank s capital ratios of the write down of the gse investments during and as well as the increase in provision for loan losses in and  and also due to the requirements of our written agreement with the federal reserve and the bureau of financial institutions  the company may raise additional capital in the future 
at this time  the compan y does not know what the nature of any capital raise will be  but expects that it could be substantially dilutive to current shareholders 
in addition to the capital raise  the company is evaluating strategies regarding capital enhancements 
such strategies could include a sale leaseback of bank owned real estate  continued reduction in assets  or further management of the securities portfolio 
in january  we elected to participate in the tarp capital purchase program and issued  of cumulative senior preferred stock to the us treasury 
this additional capital partially replaced the reduction in capital as a result of the million impairment write downs in the cost of the senior preferred dividend is approximately  annually 
there were no cash dividends on common stock paid in  compared to thousand in  and million in book value per common share was at december   compared to at december   and at december  at december   management determined that an establishment of a valuation allowance of million on its deferred tax assets was prudent given our historical losses 
there is no impact on our calculation of tier one capital for regulatory purposes given the net deferred tax assets were already excluded from the calculation 

table of contents the company s principal source of cash income is dividend payments from the bank 
certain limitations exist under applicable law and regulation by regulatory agencies regarding dividend payments to a parent by its subsidiaries 
as a result of the losses reported for and  as of december   without prior regulatory approval  the bank would not have had sufficient retained earnings available for distribution to the company as dividends 
liquidity and interest rate sensitivity liquidity 
liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management 
liquid assets include cash  interest bearing deposits with banks  federal funds sold  investments and loans maturing within one year 
our ability to obtain deposits and purchase funds at favorable rates determines its liability liquidity 
as a result of our management of liquid assets and our ability to generate liquidity through liability funding  management believes that we maintain overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy our depositors requirements and meet our customers credit needs 
additional sources of liquidity available to us include  but are not limited to  loan repayments  the ability to obtain deposits through the adjustment of interest rates  borrowing from the federal home loan bank  purchasing of federal funds from correspondent banks  and selling securities under repurchase agreements to correspondent banks as well as commercial customers 
to further meet our liquidity needs  we also have access to the federal reserve system 
in the past  growth in deposits and proceeds from the maturity of investment securities have been sufficient to fund the net increase in assets 
the bank  over the past five years  has experienced growth in average year to date deposits from million in to million in during the same period  the bank has increase d its borrowings from an average of million for to an average of million for finally over the same five year period the bank increased its assets by from an average of million for to an average of million for for the past months  the bank has decreased the average deposits to million compared to million in  a decrease 
during the same period  the bank has decreased its borrowings to million compared to million in  a decrease 
finally  during the same month period  the bank has decreased its assets to million compared to million in  a decrease 
interest rate sensitivity 
in conjunction with maintaining a satisfactory level of liquidity  management must also control the degree of interest rate risk assumed on the balance sheet 
managing this risk involves regular monitoring of the interest sensitive assets relative to interest sensitive liabilities over specific time intervals 
at december   we had a positive month and a negative month period gap position  the cumulative gap to the one year point was positive 
since the largest amount of interest sensitive assets and liabilities mature or reprice within months  we monitor this area closely 
we do not emphasize interest sensitivity analysis beyond this time frame because we believe various unpredictable factors could result in erroneous interpretations 
early withdrawal of deposits  prepayments of loans and loan delinquencies are some of the factors that could have such an effect 
in addition  changes in rates on interest sensitive assets and liabilities may not be equal  which could result in a change in net interest margin 
while we do not match each of our interest sensitive assets against specific interest sensitive lia bilities  we do seek to enhance the net interest margin while minimizing exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
effects of inflation inflation significantly affects industries having high proportions of fixed assets or high levels of inventories 
although we are not significantly affected in these areas  inflation does have an impact on the growth of assets 
as assets grow rapidly  it becomes necessary to increase equity capital at proportionate levels to maintain the appropriate equity to asset ratios 
traditionally  our earnings and high capital retention levels have enabled us to meet these needs 
our reported earnings results have been affected by inflation  but isolating the effect is difficult 
the different types of income and expense are affected in various ways 
interest rates are affected by inflation  but the timing and magnitude of the changes may not coincide with changes in the consumer price index 
management actively monitors interest rate sensitivity  as illustrated by the gap analysis  in order to minimize the effects of inflationary trends on interest rates 
other areas of non interest expenses may be more directly affected by inflation

off balance sheet arrangements we enter into certain off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these off balance sheet arrangements include unfunded commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit which would impact our liquidity and capital resources to the extent customer s accept and or use these commitments 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the nature  business purpose and elements of risk involved with these off balance sheet arrangements 
we have no other off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our finan cial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources  that is material to investors

table of contents forward looking statements certain information contained in this discussion and elsewhere in this filing may include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements are generally identified by phrases such as we expect  we believe  it is anticipated  or words of similar import 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks including  but not limited to  changes in general economic and business conditions  interest rate fluctuations  competition within and from outside the banking industry  new products and services in the banking industry  risk inherent in making loans such as repayment risks and fluctuating colla teral values  problems with technology utilized by us  changing trends in customer profiles and changes in laws and regulations applicable to us 
although we believe that our expectations with respect to the forward looking statements are based upon reliable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations  there can be no assurance that actual results  our performance or achievements will not differ materially from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies general 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
for example  we may use historical loss factors as one of the many factors and estimates utilized in determining the inherent losses that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ substantially from the historical factors that we use 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses we establish the allowance for loan losses through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when we believe that the collection of the principal is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries of losses previously charged against the allowance are credited to the allowance 
the allowance represents an amount that  in our judgment  will be appropriate to absorb any losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
our judgment in determining the level of the allowance is based on evaluations of the collectability of loans while taking into consideration such factors as trends in delinquencies and charge offs  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions that may affect a borrower s a bility to repay and the value of collateral  overall portfolio quality and specific potential losses 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
impairment of loans we measure impaired loans based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate of the loan or  as a practical expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
we consider a loan impaired when it is probable that the corporation will be unable to collect all interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement 
we do not consider a loan impaired during a period of delay in payment if we expect the ultimate collection of all amounts due 
we maintain a valuation allowance to the extent that the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment 
impairment of securities impairment of investment securities results in a write down that must be included in net income when a market decline below cost is other than temporary 
we regularly review each investment security for impairment based on criteria that include the extent to which cost exceeds market price  the duration of that market decline  the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer and our ability and intention with regard to holding the security to maturity 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general an important element of both earnings performance and liquidity is the management of our interest sensitive assets and our interest sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing within specific time intervals and the risks involved with them 
market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments in response to changes in interest rates  exchange rates and equity prices 
our market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
the asset liability management committee at the bank is comprised of the ceo  cfo  senior credit officer and an independent dir ector  and is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposures to this risk 
our board of directors reviews the guidelines established by the committee 
interest rate risk is monitored through the use of four complimentary modeling tools static gap analysis  dynamic gap simulation modeling  earnings simulation modeling and economic value simulation net present value estimation 
each of the three simulation models measure changes under a variety of interest rate scenarios 
while each of the interest rate risk measures has limitations  taken together they represent a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of our interest rate risk  the distribution of risk along the yield curve  the level of risk through time  and the amount of exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships 
static gap  which measures aggregate repricing values  is less utilized or relied upon  since it does not effectively capture or mea sure the optionality characteristics of earning assets and funding sources nor does it effectively measure the earnings impact of changes in volumes and mix of these components on us 
earnings simulation and economic value models  however  which more effectively reflect the earnings impact  are utilized by management on a regular basis 
earnings simulation analysis we use simulation analysis to measure the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates 
the model utilized by us calculates estimated earnings based on projected balances and rates 
this method is subject to the accuracy of the assumptions that underlie the process  but it provides a more realistic analysis of the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates than other analysis such as the static gap analysis 
assumptions used in the model  including loan and deposit growth rates  are derived from seasonal trends and management s outlook  as are the assumptions used to project the yields and rates for new loans and deposits 
all maturities  calls and prepayments in the securities portfolio are assumed to be reinvested in like instruments 
mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities prepayment assumptions are based on industry estimates of prepayment speeds for portfolios with similar coupon ranges and seasoning 
different interest rate scenarios and yield curves are used to measure the sensitivity of earnings to changing interest rates 
interest rates on different asset and liability accounts move differently when the prime rate changes and are accounted for in the different rate scenarios 
the following table represents the interest rate sensitivity of our net interest income net interest income at risk on a month horizon using different rate scenarios as of december  there have been no material changes in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk since this information was developed using december  data

table of contents economic value simulation we use economic value simulation to calculate the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities under different interest rate environments 
economic values are calculated based on discounted cash flow analysis 
the economic value of equity is the economic value of all assets minus the economic value of all liabilities 
the change in economic value of equity over different rate environments is an indication of the longer term repricing risk in the balance sheet 
the same assumptions are used in the economic value simulation as in the earnings simulation 
the following chart reflects the change in net market value of equity  economic value of equity at risk  by using december  data  over different rate environments with a one year horizon 
change in yield curve cumulative percentage change in economic value of equity cumulative dollar change in economic value of equity dollars in thousands basis points basis points basis points base  basis points basis points basis points management of the interest sensitivity gap the interest sensitivity gap is the difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing within a specific time interval 
the gap can be managed by repricing assets or liabilities  selling investment securities  replacing an earning asset or funding liability prior to maturity  or by adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability 
matching the amounts of assets and liabilities repricing in the same time interval helps to hedge the risk and minimize the impact on net income due to changes in market interest rates 
we evaluate interest rate risk and then formulate guidelines regarding asset generation and pricing  funding sources and pricing  and off balance sheet commitments in order to modify sens itivity risk 
these guidelines are based upon management s outlook regarding future interest rate movements  the state of the regional and national economy  and other financial and business risk factors 
our asset liability management committee reviews deposit pricing  changes in borrowed money  investment and trading activity  loan sale activities  liquidity levels and our overall interest sensitivity 
the minutes of the committee are reported to the board of directors regularly 
the periodic monitoring of interest rate risk  investment and trading activity  deposit pricing  funding and liquidity  along with any other significant transactions are managed by the chief financial officer of the bank with input from other committee members 
the following table summarizes our dynamic gap model
