under the amendment we paid down million of the outstanding million balance of our term loan b and repriced the remaining outstanding amount of million  in september  we repurchased  in the open market  million of the notes  in october  we issued million of notes  in october  we received million in federal tax refunds  in october  we purchased approximately million and million of and notes  respectively  pursuant to tender offers  in november  our board of directors declared a per share common stock dividend paid in december  in november  we redeemed all of the remaining million of notes  in december  we renewed our fox affiliation agreements  which were due to expire on march  until december  we also entered into a programming licensing agreement with the fox network which allows the company to enter into retransmission consent agreements with distributors for the remainder of the affiliation agreement  excluding political  local revenues have increased and national revenues have increased during versus as advertising levels and retransmission revenues have gained momentum 
production  selling and general and administrative expenses combined have increased over the same period primarily due to higher revenues and commissions  and political revenues increased compared to and compared to events in january  the put right period for the notes expired and no holders of the remaining million outstanding exercised put rights 
there are no further put rights through final maturity on july   in january  we extended our program service arrangement with mynetworktv until fall  in january  we entered into a multi year retransmission consent agreement with bright house networks  llc for the carriage of six of the stations owned and or operated by us in four markets  in february  our board of directors reinstated a quarterly common stock dividend of per share  in february  we entered into a multi year retransmission consent agreement with time warner cable for continued carriage of of the stations owned and or operated by us in markets  in february  revenue related to the super bowl  which aired on our fox affiliates was million  a increase from revenue generated in  the last time fox aired the super bowl  and in february  we disclosed our intention to refinance a portion of and to amend certain terms of the bank credit agreement 
in march  we reached an agreement in principle with comcast corporation for a multi year retransmission consent agreement for the continued carriage of stations in markets owned and or operated by us or to which we provide sales services 
industry trends political advertising increases in even numbered years  such as  due to the advertising expenditures from candidates running in local and national elections 
in addition  political revenue has consistently risen between presidential election or mid term election years such as from to or from to  respectively 
in every fourth year  such as  political advertising is usually elevated further due to presidential elections 
however  due to the contentious mid term elections our political revenues in not only exceeded results  but exceeded presidential election year revenues as well  the fcc has permitted broadcast television stations to use their digital spectrum for a wide variety of services including multi channel broadcasts 
the fcc must carry rules only apply to a station s primary digital stream  a number of other broadcasters  including sinclair  have joined together in organizations such as the omvc  m and the mcv to focus on efforts to accelerate the nationwide availability of mobile dtv service and work through programming  distribution and aggregation opportunities 
there is potential for broadcasters to create an additional revenue stream by providing their signals to mobile devices as well as through other multi channel initiatives  retransmission consent rules provide a mechanism for broadcasters to seek payment from multi channel video programming distributors mvpds who carry broadcasters signals 
recognition of the value of the programming content provided by broadcasters  including local news and other programming and network programming all in hd has generated increased local revenues  
table of contents automotive related advertising is a significant portion of our total net revenues in all periods presented and these revenues trended downward in most of due to the economic turmoil 
however  this sector has dramatically trended upward in and into as of the date of this filing  due to improved economic conditions  many broadcasters are enhancing upgrading their websites to use the internet to deliver rich media content  such as newscasts and weather updates  to attract advertisers  seasonal advertising increases in the second and fourth quarters due to the anticipation of certain seasonal and holiday spending by consumers  broadcasters have found ways to increase returns on their news programming initiatives while continuing to maintain locally produced content through the use of news sharing arrangements  station outsourcing arrangements are becoming more common as broadcasters seek out ways to improve revenues and margins  advertising revenue related to the olympics occurs in even numbered years and the super bowl is aired on a different network each year 
both of these popularly viewed events can have an impact on our advertising revenues  and compensation from networks to their affiliates in exchange for broadcasting of network programming has halted 
networks now require compensation from broadcasters for the use of network programming 
sources of revenues and costs our operating revenues are derived from local and national advertisers and  to a much lesser extent  from political advertisers 
from to  we began to generate new local revenues from our retransmission consent agreements 
our revenues from local advertisers had seen a continued upward trend until and when non political revenues fell from due to the economic recession 
we saw an increase in local revenues in revenues from national advertisers have continued to trend downward when measured as a percentage of total broadcast revenues 
we believe this trend is the result of our focus on increasing local advertising revenues as a percentage of total advertising revenues  combined with a decrease in overall spending by national advertisers and an increase in the number of competitive media outlets providing national advertisers multiple alternatives in which to advertise their goods or services 
our efforts to mitigate the effect of these increasingly competitive media outlets for national advertisers include continuing our efforts to increase local revenues and developing innovative sales and marketing strategies to sell traditional and non traditional services to our advertisers including the success of multi channel digital initiatives together with mobile dtv 
in addition  our revenue success is dependent on the success and advertising spending levels of the automotive industry 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to bad debts  program contract costs  intangible assets  income taxes  property and equipment  investments and derivative contracts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates have been consistently applied for all years presented in this report and in the past we have not experienced material differences between these estimates and actual results 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
valuation of goodwill  long lived assets  intangible assets and equity and cost method investments 
we periodically evaluate our goodwill  broadcast licenses  long lived assets  intangible assets and equity and cost method investments for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on estimated future cash flows  market conditions  operating performance of our stations and legal factors 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the net book value of long lived assets  intangible assets and equity and cost method investments is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents we have determined our broadcast licenses to be indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with the accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires such assets along with our goodwill to be tested for impairment on an annual basis or more often when certain triggering events occur 
as of december   we had million of goodwill  million in broadcast licenses  and million in definite lived intangibles 
we test our broadcast licenses and goodwill by estimating the fair market value of the broadcast licenses  or the fair value of our reporting units in the case of goodwill  using a combination of quoted market prices  observed earnings cash flow multiples paid for comparable television stations  discounted cash flow models and appraisals 
we then compare the estimated fair market value to the book value of these assets to determine if an impairment exists 
we aggregate our stations by market for purposes of our goodwill and license impairment testing and we believe that our markets are most representative of our broadcast reporting units because we view  manage and evaluate our stations on a market basis 
furthermore  in our markets operated as duopolies  certain costs of operating the stations are shared including the use of buildings and equipment  the sales force and administrative personnel 
our discounted cash flow model is based on our judgment of future market conditions within each designated marketing area  as well as discount rates that would be used by market participants in an arms length transaction 
future events could cause us to conclude that market conditions have declined or discount rates have increased to the extent that our broadcast licenses and or goodwill could be impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows 
based on assessments performed during the year ended december   we recorded million of impairment on our broadcast licenses and other assets  and during the years ended december  and we recorded million and million  respectively  in impairment losses on our goodwill  broadcast licenses and other assets 
the impairment charge taken in was primarily due to the severe economic downturn during the fourth quarter  and as a result  we made downward revisions to forecasted cash flows  cash flow multiples and growth rates 
of the million in impairment recorded in  we recorded million in the first quarter of we performed an interim impairment test in the first quarter of due to the severe economic downturn and continued decrease in our market capitalization 
accordingly  we made further revisions to our forecasted cash flows  cash flow multiples  and discount rates 
the impairment charge taken during the fourth quarter of was primarily due to the continued deterioration of the economy which resulted in further decreases in our forecasted cash flows and increases in our discount rates 
the million impairment charge recorded in was primarily the result of additional cash outflows for increased signal strength necessary to maintain competitive market positions 
the implied value of our broadcast goodwill is calculated using a discounted cash flow model for years and estimating the terminal value of the reporting units using a multiple of cash flows 
the value of our broadcast licenses is calculated using a discounted cash flow model for eight years and estimating the terminal value based on the constant growth model and a compound annual growth rate 
the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units to test our goodwill for impairment and to determine the fair value of our broadcast licenses consist of discount rates  revenue and expense growth rates  constant growth rates and comparable business multiples 
the revenue and expense growth rates used in our goodwill impairment testing and the revenue  expense and constant growth rates used in determining the fair value of our broadcast licenses have decreased slightly from to however  the baseline cash flows to which these growth rates were applied have increased due to a stronger than expected recovery in revenue in the growth rates are based on market studies  industry knowledge and historical performance 
the discount rates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units to test our goodwill for impairment and to determine the fair value of our broadcast licenses have slightly decreased from to the discount rate is based on a number of factors including market interest rates  a weighted average cost of capital analysis based on the target capital structure for a television station  and includes adjustments for market risk and company specific risk 
the decrease in the discount rate is primarily due to a slight decrease in the general cost of equity in the comparable business multiple used to determine the fair value of our reporting units to test our goodwill for impairment has not changed from to due to the lack of data from comparable sales transactions in the past two years  we estimated the multiple that would most likely be paid for a mature  cash flowing television station in the current marketplace 
after taking the effect of the above mentioned impairment  as of december   all of our reporting units tested for goodwill impairment had fair values that were greater than the carrying value by more than 
for the year ended december   an increase in our discount rate of and or a decrease in our multiple of would not result in a goodwill impairment 
an increase in our discount rate of greater than or a decrease in our multiple of greater than would likely cause reporting units to fail our step test for goodwill impairment and could lead to goodwill impairment 
when factors indicate that there may be a decrease in value of an equity or cost method investment  we assess that investment and determine whether a loss in value has occurred 
if that loss is deemed to be other than temporary an impairment loss is recorded 
for any investments that indicate a potential impairment  we estimate the fair value of those investments using discounted cash flow models  unrelated third party valuations or industry comparables  based on the various facts available to us 

table of contents during  we recorded million of impairment on equity method investments 
no impairment of our equity or cost method investments was recorded in or revenue recognition 
advertising revenues  net of agency commissions  are recognized in the period during which commercials are aired 
all other revenues are recognized as services are provided 
the revenues realized from station barter arrangements are recorded as the programs are aired at the estimated fair value of the advertising airtime given in exchange for the program rights 
our retransmission consent agreements contain both advertising and retransmission consent elements that are paid in cash 
we have determined that our agreements are revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
advertising and retransmission consent deliverables sold under our agreements are separated into different units of accounting based on fair value 
revenue applicable to the advertising element of the arrangement is recognized consistent with the advertising revenue policy noted above 
revenue applicable to the retransmission consent element of the arrangement is recognized ratably over the life of the agreement 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from extending credit to our customers that are unable to make required payments 
if the economy and or the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
for example  a increase in the balance of our allowance for doubtful accounts as of december   would increase bad debt expense by approximately million 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
program contract costs 
we have agreements with distributors for the rights to televise programming over contract periods  which generally run from one to seven years 
contract payments are made in installments over terms that are generally equal to or shorter than the contract period 
each contract is recorded as an asset and a liability at an amount equal to its gross cash contractual commitment when the license period begins and the program is available for its first showing 
the portion of program contracts which become payable within one year is reflected as a current liability in the consolidated balance sheets 
as of december  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  in program contract assets and million and million  respectively  in program contract liabilities 
the programming rights are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value nrv 
estimated nrvs are based on management s expectation of future advertising revenue  net of sales commissions  to be generated by the remaining program material available under the contract terms 
in conjunction with our nrv analysis of programming rights reflected in our consolidated balance sheets  we perform similar analysis on future programming rights yet to be reflected in our consolidated balance sheets and establish allowances when future payments exceed the estimated nrv 
amortization of program contract costs is generally computed using a four year accelerated method or a straight line method  depending on the length of the contract 
program contract costs estimated by management to be amortized within one year are classified as current assets 
program contract liabilities are typically paid on a scheduled basis and are not reflected by adjustments for amortization or estimated nrv 
if our estimate of future advertising revenues declines  then additional write downs to nrv may be required 
income tax 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statements carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
as of december  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  in deferred tax assets and million and million  respectively  in deferred tax liabilities 
we provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine  based on the weight of all available evidence  that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as of december   valuation allowances have been provided for a substantial amount of our available state net operating losses 
management periodically performs a comprehensive review of our tax positions and accrues amounts for tax contingencies 
based on these reviews  the status of ongoing audits and the expiration of applicable statute of limitations  accruals are adjusted as necessary in accordance with income tax accounting guidance 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb ratified the emerging issues task force s eitf s amended guidance on accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the amended guidance allows the use of an estimated selling price for the undelivered units of accounting in transactions in which vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or third party evidence tpe does not exist 
the amended guidance no longer allows the use of the residual method when allocating arrangement consideration between the delivered and undelivered units of accounting if vsoe and tpe of selling price does not exist for all units of accounting 
entities are required to estimate the selling price of the deliverables  when vsoe and tpe are not available  and then allocate the consideration based on the relative selling prices of the deliverables 
this guidance also requires additional disclosures including the amount of revenue recognized each reporting period and the amount of deferred revenue as of the end of each reporting period under this guidance 
this guidance is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning after june  and should be applied on a prospective basis 
we do not believe that this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in january  the fasb amended the guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures to add two new disclosure provisions to the current fair value disclosure guidance  including details of transfers in and out of level and level measurements  and gross presentation of activity within the level roll forward 
the guidance also amends two existing fair value disclosure requirements so that entities are required to disclose the valuation techniques and inputs used to develop fair value measurements for assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on both a recurring basis and nonrecurring basis in periods subsequent to initial recognition and fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities 
a class is defined as a subset of assets or liabilities within a line item in the statement of financial position 
the guidance is for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the changes to the level roll forward which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we added the required disclosures under this guidance to our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb ratified the eitf s amended guidance with respect to goodwill impairment 
the amended guidance requires that step two of the goodwill impairment test be performed if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is zero or negative and it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists based on any adverse qualitative factors including an evaluation of the triggering circumstances noted in the guidance 
the change is effective for fiscal years and interim changes within those years beginning after december  we do not believe that this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations in general  this discussion is related to the results of our continuing operations  except for discussions regarding our cash flows  which also include the results of our discontinued operations 
unless otherwise indicated  references in this discussion to  and are to our fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
additionally  any references to the first  second  third or fourth quarters are to the three months ended march  june  september and december  respectively  for the year being discussed 
we have two reportable segments  broadcast and other operating divisions that are disclosed separately from our corporate activities 
seasonality cyclicality our operating results are usually subject to seasonal fluctuations 
usually  the second and fourth quarter operating results are higher than the first and third quarters because advertising expenditures are increased in anticipation of certain seasonal and holiday spending by consumers 
the negative financial and economic conditions effected the usual seasonal fluctuations in in  as the economy started to stabilize and recover  our seasonal fluctuations returned to normal 
our operating results are usually subject to fluctuations from political advertising 
in even numbered years  political spending is usually significantly higher than in odd numbered years due to advertising expenditures preceding local and national elections 
additionally  every four years  political spending is elevated further due to advertising expenditures preceding the presidential election 
due to the contentious mid term elections our political revenues in not only exceeded results  but exceeded presidential election year revenues as well

automotive  our largest category in  was up compared to as automotive dealers and manufacturers increased spending in response to an increase in auto sales 
from a revenue category standpoint  when compared to was impacted by decreases in virtually all of the advertising sectors 
however  during the later half of the year  we did see a positive trend in increased advertising spending which continued through the end of the year 
services was our largest category in  however  during the fourth quarter we began to see a trend back towards the historical norm of automotive advertising representing our largest category as automotive dealers and manufacturers increased spending 
during  automotive revenues were helped by the government s cash for clunkers program  however  our net times sales from the automotive sector were down for compared to political revenues 
political revenues  which include time sales from political advertising  increased by million to million for when compared to political revenues are typically higher in election years such as a contentious mid term election  resulted in political spending exceeding s million

we expect political revenues to decrease in from levels 
local revenues 
excluding political revenues  our local broadcast revenues  which include local times sales  retransmission revenues and other local revenues  were up million for  compared to the increase is due to an increase in advertising spending particularly in the automotive sector and an increase in retransmission revenues from mvpds 
excluding political revenues  our local broadcast revenues were down million for when compared to this decrease was primarily due to negative financial and economic conditions  which impeded advertising spending levels  as well as  a decrease due to a change in networks for the super bowl programming from fox to nbc 
these decreases were offset by an increase in revenues from retransmission consent agreements with mvpds 
national revenues 
our national broadcast revenues  excluding political revenues  which include national time sales and other national revenues  were up million for when compared to over the past few years  national revenues have trended downward  however  our results were up 
this was primarily due to the amplified decline in from the effects of the recent recession and a rebound in advertising spending in along with the assistance from an improved automotive sector 
excluding political revenues  our national broadcast revenues were down million for when compared to this decrease was partially due to negative financial and economic conditions  which impeded advertising spending levels

these increases were partially offset by a decrease in electric expense due to the digital signal conversion in june and cessation of analog transmission 
station production expenses for decreased compared to this decrease was primarily due to lower compensation expense and electric expenses due to the digital signal conversion in june and cessation of analog transmission 
additionally  promotional advertising decreased due to our revised media spending plan 
station selling  general and administrative expenses 
station selling  general and administrative expenses increased for compared to this increase was primarily due to higher national sales representative and local commissions costs due to an increase in sales and increased non income based tax expenses 
these increases were partially offset by decreased trade transaction expense and bad debt expense 
station selling  general and administrative expenses decreased for compared to this decrease was primarily due to lower compensation expense and local commissions and national rep commissions savings due to lower revenues in compared to we expect station production and station selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding barter  to trend higher than our results 
amortization of program contract costs and net realizable value adjustments 
the amortization of program contract costs decreased during compared to and compared to over the past few years  we have entered into barter arrangements for short term program contracts which are less expensive and result in lower contract cost amortization

table of contents debt ratings our ability to finance working capital needs  capital expenditures and general corporate needs from the public and private markets  as well as the associated cost of funding is dependent  in part  on our credit ratings 
during  in conjunction with the amendment of the bank credit agreement  the notes issuance  and the and notes tenders  both moody s investor services moody s and standard poor s ratings services s p raised our credit ratings 
the notes are not rated

sources and uses of cash the following table sets forth our cash flows for the years ended december   and in millions net cash flows from operating activities cash flows from used in investing activities acquisition of property and equipment payments for acquisition of television stations consolidation of variable interest entity payments for acquisitions of other operating divisions companies decrease increase in restricted cash dividends and distributions from cost method investees purchase of alarm monitoring contracts investments in equity and cost method investees other net cash flows from used in investing activities cash flows used in from financing activities proceeds from notes payable  commercial bank financing and capital leases repayments of notes payable  commercial bank financing and capital leases repurchase of class a common stock payments for deferred financing costs dividends paid on class a and class b common stock proceeds from derivative terminations purchase of subsidiary shares from noncontrolling interest noncontrolling interests distributions other net cash flows used in financing activities 
table of contents operating activities net cash flows from operating activities increased during the year ended december  compared to the same period in during  we received more cash receipts from customers  net of cash payments to vendors  however  we paid more interest and program payments 
in  we received larger tax refunds than in net cash flows from operating activities decreased during the year ended december  compared to the same period in during  we received less cash receipts from customers  net of cash payments to venders for operating expenses and working capital cash activities and received less in tax refunds 
in  we made a payment of original issuance discount associated with our notes 
these decreases to operating cash were partially offset by less interest and tax payments in we expect program payments to decrease in compared to we expect net interest expense to decrease in compared to investing activities with the exception of restricted cash  net cash flows used in investing activities decreased slightly during the year ended december  compared to the same period in we decreased our investment in restricted cash in order to use the cash to pay for redemptions of the and notes through a combination of tender offers  put rights and open market purchases 
with the exception of restricted cash  net cash flows used in investing activities decreased during the year ended december  compared to the same period in in  we focused our cash use towards debt and stock redemptions in the first quarter and conservation of cash during the second  third and fourth quarters instead of new investment opportunities 
we purchased no other operating divisions companies or television stations during we decreased our equity investments and capital expenditures 
in addition  we increased the purchase of alarm monitoring contracts in as that business continued to grow 
finally  the increase in in restricted cash was primarily related to the cash collateral account associated with the and notes 
in  we anticipate incurring more capital expenditures than incurred in financing activities net cash flows used in financing activities increased during the year ended december  compared to the same period in during  we purchased million principal amount of our notes  notes and notes pursuant to a combination of tender offers  put rights and open market purchases 
we reduced our term loan b by million through a combination of an early repayment and the amendment of our bank credit agreement in in addition  we fully extinguished the outstanding million principal amount of notes in during  we issued million in principal amount of our notes 
net cash flows used in financing activities decreased during the year ended december  compared to the same period in we had more debt proceeds than debt repayments in compared to primarily due to the cash required to be held in the cash collateral account associated with the and notes 
in addition  the volume of proceeds and repayment activity was greater in compared to as well as the payments made for deferred financing costs due to the refinancings that occurred in the fourth quarter of from time to time  we may repurchase additional outstanding debt and stock on the open market 
we expect to fund any repurchases with cash generated from operating activities and in some cases  borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we ceased paying our cash dividend after the first quarter of  however  in november  our board of directors declared a per share common stock dividend paid in december in february  our board of directors reinstated a quarterly common stock dividend of per share 
future dividends on our common shares  if any  will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on several factors including our results of operations  cash requirements and surplus  financial condition  covenant restrictions and other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant 
under the terms of the bank credit agreement  in certain circumstances we may make up to million in unrestricted cash payments including but not limited to dividends and other strategic investments 

table of contents contractual obligations we have various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
other items  such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed 
for example  we are contractually committed to acquire future programming and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements 
the following table reflects a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of december  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash in millions contractual obligations related to continuing operations a total and thereafter b notes payable  capital leases and commercial bank financing c  d notes and capital leases payable to affiliates c operating leases employment contracts program content e programming services f maintenance and support other operating contracts lma and outsourcing agreements g investments and loan commitments h total contractual cash obligations a excluded from this table are million of accrued unrecognized tax benefits

active program contracts are included in the balance sheet as an asset and liability while future program contracts are excluded until the cost is known  the program is available for its first showing or telecast and the licensee has accepted the program 
industry protocol typically enables us to make payments for program contracts on a three month lag  which differs from the contractual timing within the table 
network programming agreements may include variable fee components such as subscriber levels  which in certain circumstances have been estimated and reflected in the table

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements as defined by the sec means any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the registrant is a party  under which the registrant has obligations under certain guarantees or contracts  retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangements  obligations under certain derivative arrangements  and obligations arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity 
as of december   we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
at times we enter into derivative instruments primarily for the purpose of reducing the impact of changing interest rates on our floating rate debt and to reduce the impact of changing fair market values on our fixed rate debt 
see note derivative instruments and note notes payable and commercial bank financing  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
on august   we entered into an amendment of our bank credit agreement 
under the amendment  we paid down million of the outstanding million balance under the term loan b and repriced the remaining million outstanding 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our term loan b and no amount drawn on our revolving credit facility 
the term loan b will initially bear interest at libor plus with a libor floor 
any outstanding amounts accrue interest with a variable rate and therefore increases our risk to increases from interest rates 
during  the three month libor rate slightly increased 
we are exposed to risk from a change in interest rates to the extent we are required to refinance existing fixed rate indebtedness at rates higher than those prevailing at the time the existing indebtedness was incurred 
the fair value of the notes  notes  notes  notes and notes combined was million as of december  we estimate that adding to prevailing interest rates would result in a decrease in fair value of these notes by million as of december  generally  the fair market value of these notes will decrease as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates fall 
under certain circumstances  we have contingent cash interest features related to the notes and the notes 
the contingent cash interest feature for both issuances were embedded derivatives which have negligible fair values
