overview we are the largest boating supply retailer in the world with net revenues of million and net income of million 
our business strategy is to offer a broad assortment of merchandise for the boat and for the boater that meets the needs of individual boaters and boating businesses  provides great customer experiences and offers the convenience of multi channel shopping 
a few of the new or continuing key strategies we are implementing or building upon during include expanding our merchandise selection  including adding product assortment throughout all of our wide range of merchandise categories and accelerating development of west marine private label brands across a number of categories 
continuing to focus on our real estate optimization program pursuant to which we are evolving toward having fewer but larger stores 
growing our port supply wholesale business by continuing to leverage our store network as a complement to delivering goods out of our distribution centers  with an emphasis on treating our larger stores in certain markets as mini distribution centers that offer assortment  convenience and competitive pricing with better service and more delivery options 
improving the on line experience for our customers with more and better content  improved search capabilities  faster speed and other new features 
providing outstanding product information and search capabilities by taking steps to better provide information that customers want and need through technology solutions and educational programs that help our customers and associates better access products and information 
focusing on targeted marketing via customer relationship management strategies 

table of contents we have three reportable segments stores  port supply  and direct sales 
our stores segment generated approximately of our net revenues 
our company operated stores open at the end of are located in states  puerto rico and canada 
in addition  during  we had three franchised stores in turkey  however  we are in discussions with our franchisee to terminate this franchise relationship 
see recent developments for more information 
our port supply segment is one of the largest wholesale distributors of marine equipment in the united states 
products shipped to port supply customers directly from our distribution centers represented approximately of our net revenues 
our direct sales segment  which includes our internet and call center operations  offers customers around the world more than  products  and it accounted for the remaining of our net revenues 
recent developments in january  we entered into a new lease agreement for our distribution center located in hollister  california 
the new lease commenced on february  and the former lease expired on february  the new lease term ends on october  for more information  see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k 
we are in discussions with our franchisee in turkey to voluntarily terminate the franchise relationship which we expect to occur in or around april however  we expect the former franchise partner will continue to purchase marine related products through our port supply division 
the royalties received from this franchisee were immaterial to our results of operations in all periods presented 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain income statement components expressed as a percent of net revenues net revenues cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expense store closures and other restructuring costs impairment of long lived assets income loss from operations interest expense income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss fiscal compared with fiscal net revenues for were million  an increase of  compared to net revenues of million for we believe that net revenues in fiscal year were favorably affected by changes in the competitive landscape that occurred during fiscal year  as well as favorable weather throughout much of the boating season 
however  we believe there was a general softening in the boating equipment market after the fourth of july 
our mix of business in the southeast during the second quarter was impacted by the effects of the oil spill in the gulf of mexico 
while not significant  we did experience a decrease in sales of merchandise typically used by recreational boaters and fishermen in the affected areas of the southeast 
however  this decrease was offset by increased sales of products to customers engaged in fighting the effects of the spill 
there did not appear to be any significant sales impact for the third and fourth quarters related to the oil spill 
net income for was million compared to net income for of million 

table of contents segment revenues net revenues for the stores segment increased million  or  to million in  primarily due to a million  or  increase in comparable store sales 
a driver of the comparable store sales increase was higher sales to wholesale customers through our store locations  which we believe resulted from our ongoing efforts to better serve this group of customers through store locations 
in certain markets  our larger stores serve as mini distribution centers that offer better assortments  convenience  and competitive pricing with better service and more delivery options for wholesale customers 
the increase in net revenues was across most merchandise categories and sales benefited from our expanded assortments in clothing  as well as increased sales for electronics and maintenance related products 
real estate activity connected with our store optimization strategy drove a million increase in net revenues as stores opened during the fourth quarter of  and stores opened during generated million in sales  whereas stores closed during these same periods effectively reduced net revenues by million 
additionally  early in  we began to see signs that customers were preparing their boats for usage as reflected by our increase in sales during the first quarter of  led by growth in maintenance related products 
we also saw recovery in demand for our higher priced items  such as electronics 
however  we expect consumers to continue to carefully evaluate their needs based boating purchases and be conservative with their spending on discretionary items 
we believe that economic uncertainty could continue to have an impact on our sales  with corresponding risks to our earnings and cash flow in in response  we will continue to focus on managing expenses and maximizing cash flow 
during  we expect to open and close a small number of stores in connection with our real estate optimization strategy of evolving to having fewer  larger stores in many of our key markets 
as a result of these actions  we expect that our overall store counts will decline slightly  while our total selling square footage will remain stable or increase slightly 
in addition  we will continue with our practice of monitoring the operating performance and economics of all store locations and evaluating for closure any underperforming stores when the economics favor doing so 
port supply net revenues through our distribution centers decreased million  or  to million in compared to however  sales to the wholesale customer group increased in our stores segment 
we believe the shift from port supply to stores was driven by our ongoing efforts to better serve our wholesale customers through our store locations 
net revenues from our direct sales segment decreased million  or  to million 
we began to see the decrease in this segment following the launch of our updated website in the second quarter of the transition to the updated site negatively affected sales 
however  we believe this decline was temporary  and we began to see a rebound in the sales performance of this segment late in the third quarter and continuing through the fourth quarter 
comparable store sales comparable store sales for increased by  or million  compared to comparable store sales changes during the first  second  third and fourth quarters of were   and  respectively 
the overall comparable store trends were consistent across the geographic regions 
the increase in comparable store sales was across most merchandise categories and  in particular  we continued to experience increased sales for electronics and maintenance related products 
while it appears the economy has stabilized  there remains some uncertainty about the market for boating supplies and related merchandise 
we currently anticipate that our fiscal year comparable store sales will only increase slightly versus fiscal year  in the range of flat to up approximately 

table of contents gross profit gross profit increased by million  or  to million in  compared to million for  primarily due to higher sales 
gross profit increased as a percentage of net revenues by to in  compared to in  primarily due to a increase in raw product margin driven by more effective promotions  less clearance activity and a shift in revenues to higher margin core boating categories  such as maintenance 
additionally  increased revenues allowed us to leverage our relatively fixed occupancy expenses by 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative sg a expense for was million  an increase of million  or  compared to million for last year 
expenses as a percentage of revenues remained flat at 
drivers of the higher sg a expense included a variable selling expense increase of million primarily due to selective investments in additional staffing in our stores during the second and third quarters  our busiest quarters  a million unfavorable comparison versus last year due to the impact of foreign currency exchange  million in higher information technology spending to implement our new point of sale and order entry systems  which we expect to launch in  and million related to west marine university  our national sales meeting held every other year 
sg a expense in was reduced by million upon receipt of an insurance reimbursement related to costs associated with the sec investigation which closed during that year 
the increase in sg a was partially offset by a million reduction in bonus expense in when compared to store closure and other restructuring costs store closure and other restructuring costs for changed by million when compared to during the fourth quarter of  we reached an agreement to sublease a location which had a large associated termination obligation 
the terms of this particular agreement were more favorable than what we originally estimated and resulted in a million reversal in of the previously accrued estimated costs 
for additional information  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets expenses related to the impairment of long lived assets were million in fiscal  compared to less than million in one underperforming store was found to be impaired during the second quarter of fiscal interest expense interest expense decreased million  or  to million in  compared to million in the decrease in interest expense was due to both lower interest rates and lower average outstanding bank borrowings in fiscal  compared to fiscal cash provided by operating activities funded property and equipment investments with excess cash being used to pay down debt 
this was the primary driver of the lower average outstanding bank borrowings in income taxes our effective income tax rate for was a provision of  compared to a benefit of in the year over year change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the recognition of a million benefit in related to a tax law change that increased the number of historical years in which companies are permitted to carry back prior period net operating losses 
similar to  in we were able to use timing differences that were not previously benefited due to the valuation allowance to reduce the statutory tax rate 
given that our recent improved financial performance has been for a limited time period combined with the continued economic uncertainty with respect to the general state of the economy and rising fuel costs  we 
table of contents concluded that  while evidence related to current and future financial performance is improving  there remains sufficient economic uncertainty that it would be premature to assert that it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize all net deferred tax assets and release some or all of the partial valuation allowance 
each quarter  we assess the total weight of positive and negative evidence and evaluate whether release of all or any portion of the valuation allowance is appropriate 
should we come to the conclusion that a release of the valuation allowance is required  there could be a significant increase in net income and earnings per share due to the impact on the tax rate 
for more information  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
fiscal compared with fiscal net revenues for were million  a decrease of  compared to net revenues of million for net revenues were unfavorably impacted by million due to an extra week in fiscal year  when compared to fiscal year net income for was million 
this compares to a net loss for of million  which included a million pre tax charge for store closures and other restructuring costs  a million non cash  pre tax charge for impairment of long lived assets and the impact of a million charge to provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
segment revenues net revenues for the stores segment decreased million  or  to million in  primarily due to an million  or  decrease in comparable store sales and a million decrease attributable to store closures in and partially offsetting these decreases was million of revenue from new stores opened in and the stores segment generated million of revenues in the first and extra week of fiscal  which negatively impacted comparisons year over year 
during fiscal  we believe that our business was favorably impacted by continued improvement in boat usage  continued movement towards do it yourself projects  and favorable results from our product expansions and larger store formats 
we believe we also benefited from changes in the competitive landscape  including the liquidation of one of our primary national competitors  as well as from lower gas prices during peak boating season 
port supply net revenues through our distribution centers decreased million  or  to million in  primarily due to lower sales year over year to two customer types  boat dealers and boat builders 
we believe these customers were negatively impacted by the challenging economic environment and tight credit markets 
net revenues from our direct sales segment decreased million  or  to million  due to a decline in the international market year over year  at a much greater pace than domestic activity 
comparable store sales comparable store sales for the week period ended january  decreased by  or million  compared to the week period ended january  comparable store sales changes during the first  second  third and fourth quarters of were   and  respectively 
the overall comparable store trends were consistent across the geographic regions 
the decline in comparable store sales reflected lower sales of discretionary items  partially offset by increased sales of core boating parts and accessories 
gross profit gross profit decreased by million  or  to million in  compared to million for  primarily due to lower sales 
however  gross profit increased as a percentage of net revenues by to in  compared to in  primarily due to a increase in product margin driven by more effective promotions  less clearance activity and a shift in revenues to higher margin core boating categories  such as maintenance 
additionally  inventory shrinkage improved by and buying and distribution costs 
table of contents leveraged by 
improvements were partially offset by the deleveraging of in occupancy expense 
occupancy is our largest fixed expense  and its impact on gross margin rate is largely driven by sales results and the fixed nature of the expense 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a expense decreased by million  or  to million in  compared to million for and decreased as a percentage of revenues by to in  compared to in the decrease in sg a expense primarily was due to million in lower support and selling overhead expense  including a million reduction in costs related to the settled sec investigation 
sg a was also lower by million for lower payroll  marketing and other variable expenses reflecting lower revenues 
decreased expenses associated with stores closed in resulted in a further reduction of million 
expenses also were lower by million due to favorable foreign currency translation gains compared to the fiscal year 
lower expenses were partially offset by million in higher accrued bonus expense reflecting performance above budgeted expectations and million in higher expense related to the additional week in fiscal store closure and other restructuring costs store closure and other restructuring costs for decreased by million compared to during  we recognized restructuring expenses of million consisting of million for store closures  million for port supply  million for closing a distribution center  million for repositioning the call center and million of severance costs for reductions in force at our watsonville  california support center 
also in  due to unfavorable macroeconomic conditions  we increased reserves for lease contract termination obligations by million for stores closed as part of our restructuring plan 
during the fourth quarter of  we reached an agreement to sublease a location which had the largest associated termination obligation 
the terms of this particular agreement were more favorable than what we originally estimated and resulted in a million reversal in of the previously accrued estimated costs 
for additional information  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets expenses related to the impairment of long lived assets were less than million in fiscal  compared to million in the non cash charge primarily was attributable to the underperforming stores  of which have been closed 
interest expense interest expense decreased million  or  to million in  compared to million in the decrease in interest expense was due to both lower interest rates and lower average outstanding bank borrowings in compared to income taxes our effective income tax rate for was a benefit of  compared to a provision of in the change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the use of net operating losses under federal legislation introduced in late which allowed companies to extend the carry back period from two to five years for periods beginning or ending in or  as well as our ability to use timing differences not previously benefited due to the valuation allowance 
the year over year difference also was due to management s decision in to increase the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets by million to bring the aggregate valuation allowance to million

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we ended with cash of million  an increase from million at the end of working capital  the excess of current assets over current liabilities  increased to million at the end of  compared to million at the end of the increase in working capital primarily was attributable to a million higher cash balance at the end of fiscal and a million increase in merchandise inventories  net of reserves  at the end of fiscal despite having a significant cash balance at the end of fiscal year  we expect to continue to borrow from our line of credit for a portion of the year due to the seasonality in our business 
increased inventory was driven by our strategy to bring in additional inventory earlier in the season this past year and to maintain safety stocks to help ensure in stock position and to help fulfill customer needs and maximize sales throughout the boating season 
neither our access to  nor the value of  our cash equivalents was materially affected by the liquidity problems experienced by certain financial institutions over the past several years 
our cash needs for working capital are supported by a secured credit facility 
there is risk to this capital resource stemming from current market conditions in that the amount we have available to borrow under our loan agreement primarily is driven by the estimated liquidation value of our inventory 
external factors  such as increased liquidations and bankruptcies in the marketplace  could put downward pressure on this liquidation value and thus our associated borrowing availability 
however  we continue to take steps to mitigate this risk 
first  we are focusing on maximizing cash flow and minimizing borrowing needs 
we expect to accomplish this by i increasing inventory turnover  which will require lower working capital to maintain fresh and adequate inventory at our stores  ii continuing to focus on expense control  including continual re engineering efforts to simplify and streamline administrative  inventory and other business processes  and to shrink or eliminate overhead costs as and when necessary or appropriate  and iii being conservative in capital spending and concentrating on investments with a demonstrable financial return 
second  we are improving the quality of our inventory by controlling the proportion of overstocked or discontinued goods 
third  we are maintaining communications with our lenders to keep them apprised of our business plans 
operating activities during  our primary source of liquidity was cash flow from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased year over year by million to million in  compared to million last year 
the major driver of this cash flow reduction was a million increase in merchandise inventories during  compared to a million reduction in the prior year as we focused in fiscal on necessary inventory reductions 
as noted above  the increased inventory in fiscal was driven by our strategy to bring in additional inventory earlier in the season and to maintain safety stocks to help ensure in stock position and to help fulfill customer needs and maximize sales throughout the boating season 
we continue to focus on inventory management and ensuring the correct product assortment in each store based on customer demographics 
a million decrease in accounts payable during  compared to a million increase in accounts payable during  also contributed to the decline in cash provided by operating activities 
capital growth in  our capital expenditures were million  primarily for new stores  store remodels  information technology and investment in supply chain efficiencies 
we opened ten new stores and remodeled four stores in during  we expect a moderate increase in capital expenditures from levels  primarily for store development activities  including new stores  store remodels and expansions  and information technology enhancements 
we intend to fund our expansion through cash generated from operations and  if necessary  credit facility borrowings 
financing arrangements net cash provided by financing activities was million in  primarily consisting of million increase in cash related to associate share based compensation plans  partially offset by million in cash used 
table of contents to pay loan costs associated with our amended and restated loan agreement that we entered into in the third quarter of  pursuant to which we have up to million in borrowing capacity 
at our option and subject to certain conditions precedent set forth in the loan agreement  we may increase our borrowing capacity up to an additional million during the term 
the amount available to be borrowed is based on a percentage of certain of our inventory excluding capitalized indirect costs and accounts receivable 
this loan agreement amends and supersedes our previous loan and security agreement that would have expired at the end of the revolving credit facility is guaranteed by west marine  inc and west marine canada corp 
an indirect subsidiary of west marine  inc and secured by a security interest in all of our accounts receivable and inventory  certain other related assets  and all proceeds thereof 
the revolving credit facility is available for general working capital and general corporate purposes 
at our election  borrowings under the revolving credit facility will bear interest at one of the following options the prime rate  which is defined in the loan agreement as the highest of a the federal funds rate  as in effect from time to time  plus one half of one percent  b the libor rate for a one month interest period plus one percent  or c the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by wells fargo as its prime rate  or the libor rate quoted by the british bankers association for the applicable interest period 
in each case  the applicable interest rate is increased by a margin imposed by the loan agreement 
the applicable margin for any date will depend upon the amount of available credit under the revolving credit facility  and the margin range is between and for option and between and for option 
the loan agreement also imposes a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility available 
for  and  the weighted average interest rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was  and  respectively 
although the loan agreement contains customary covenants  including  but not limited to  restrictions on our ability to incur liens  make acquisitions and investments  pay dividends and sell or transfer assets  it does not contain debt or other similar financial covenants  such as maintaining certain specific leverage  debt service or interest coverage ratios 
instead  our loan is asset based which means our lenders maintain a security interest in our inventory and accounts receivable which serve as collateral for the loan  and the amount we may borrow under our revolving credit facility at any given time is determined by the estimated value of these assets as determined by the lenders appraisers 
additionally  we must maintain a minimum revolving credit availability equal to the greater of million or of the borrowing base 
in addition  there are customary events of default under our loan agreement  including failure to comply with our covenants 
if we fail to comply with any of the covenants contained in the loan agreement  an event of default occurs which  if not waived by our lenders or cured within the applicable time periods  results in the lenders having the right to accelerate repayment of all outstanding indebtedness under the loan agreement before the stated maturity date and the revolving credit facility could be terminated 
these events of default include  after the expiration of any applicable grace periods  payment defaults to the lenders  material inaccuracies of representations and warranties  covenant defaults  material payment defaults other than under the loan agreement  voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy proceedings  material money judgments  material erisa events  change of control and other customary defaults 
a default under our loan agreement also could significantly and adversely affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing 
as of january   we were in compliance with the covenants under our loan agreement 
at the end of and  there were no amounts outstanding under our credit facilities  and we had million and million  respectively  available to be borrowed 
at the end of and  we had million and million  respectively  of outstanding commercial and stand by letters of credit 
we strategically manage our debt over the course of our fiscal year 
we incur seasonal fluctuations in our cash flows and  therefore  we incur debt as we build up our inventories for spring in order to maintain stock levels sufficient to fulfill customer needs and maximize sales during the main boating season 
additionally  we hire a significant number of temporary associates during the summer  our peak selling season 
our weighted average outstanding balances for the first quarters of and were million and million  respectively 
for our second quarters of and  the weighted average outstanding balances were million and 
table of contents million  respectively  and at the end of our third quarters of and  the weighted average outstanding balances were million and million  respectively 
the fourth quarter weighted average outstanding balances for both and were not material 
our aggregate borrowing base cannot exceed million 
our borrowing base at each of our last two fiscal year ends consisted of the following in millions accounts receivable availability inventory availability less reserves less minimum availability total borrowing base our aggregate borrowing base was reduced by the following obligations in millions ending loan balance outstanding letters of credit total obligations accordingly  our availability as of fiscal year end and  respectively  was in millions total borrowing base less obligations total availability contractual obligations aggregate information about our unconditional contractual obligations as of january  is presented in the following table in thousands 
payments due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual cash obligations operating leases purchase commitments bank letters of credit other long term liabilities operating lease amounts in this table represent minimum amounts due under existing agreements and exclude costs of insurance  taxes  repairs and maintenance 
all but a limited number of our purchase commitments are cancelable by us without penalty  however  we do intend to honor these commitments 
we are party to various arrangements that are conditional in nature and obligate us to make payments only upon the occurrence of certain events  such as delivery of functioning software products 
because it is not possible to predict the timing or amounts that may be due under these conditional arrangements  no such amounts have been included in the table above 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements operating leases are the only financing arrangements not reported on our consolidated balance sheets 
we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as special purpose entities or variable interest entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes 
as of january   we are not involved in any unconsolidated special purpose entities or variable interest entities 
seasonality historically  our business has been highly seasonal 
in  approximately of our net sales and all of our net income occurred during the second and third quarters  principally during the period from april through august  which represents the peak months for boat buying  usage and maintenance in most of our markets 
business trends our research and experience indicates that the us boating industry experienced a down cycle in  as evidenced by lower sales in each of our business segments compared to  lower new and used boat sales  and declines in boat registrations in key states 
early in  we began to see signs that customers were preparing their boats for usage  based on increased sales during the first quarter of and led by growth in maintenance related products 
we also saw recovery in demand for our higher priced items  such as electronics 
as we progressed through  we observed that proportionately more sales growth was coming from our port supply wholesale business  particularly in sales to port supply customers through our stores 
these particular sales increases allowed us to leverage our relatively fixed store occupancy expenses 
we experienced favorable weather conditions throughout most of the boating season  however  we believe there was a general softening in the boating equipment market after the fourth of july 
from a competitive perspective  we also believe we benefitted during the first half of from the closure of the boater s world chain of stores in mid  however  there did not appear to be any corresponding sales impact during the third and fourth quarters of in the near future  while we will continue to manage our business conservatively from an operating expense standpoint  we will also take steps to remain flexible and to maximize sales in the face of varying marketplace demand 
specifically  these actions will include making prudent strategic investments in additional core inventory items to maintain in stock levels in the event improved sales continue  and hiring additional store associates as needed to maintain customer service levels  while leveraging payroll expense as a percentage of sales 
although we believe we have seen some recent recovery in customer boat usage and demand for higher priced items  we believe that the ongoing uncertainty in economic conditions has had  and will continue to have  an adverse impact on discretionary consumer spending in an already challenging climate for the boating industry  and we believe that economic uncertainty could continue to have an impact on our sales  with corresponding risks to our earnings and cash flow in see the fiscal compared with fiscal segment revenues discussion included above 
for  it is our expectation that comparable sales will increase only slightly versus the prior year  in the range of flat to up approximately 
therefore  we will continue to control expense growth and maximize cash flow by controlling our operating expenses through variable expense management  as well as reengineering and streamlining business processes  continuing to improve the quality of our inventory by tightly controlling overstocked or discontinued goods  proceeding with our ongoing real estate optimization program  evolving to having fewer  larger stores with anticipated improved store economics  
table of contents managing the business to the budget established for  which focuses on expense control and emphasizes working capital management  and exploring methods and strategies to drive sales and market presence 
more broadly  in order to better meet the needs of our customers and provide a better customer experience  we have invested in a strategic project to replace our aging point of sale and order management systems 
the new platform is intended to enable an integrated cross channel selling experience for the customer including faster sales checkout  improved product search capability  integrated customer information and order management  and simplified policy application 
we anticipate launching the system in while we are approaching this project in a measured and methodical manner  the precise timing for company wide roll out of the system and the integrity and efficiency of the system are not assured at this time 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of west marine s financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
we believe our application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are periodically reevaluated and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  in item of this report 

table of contents management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions inventory valuation adjustments we value our merchandise inventories at the lower of the cost or market value on an average cost basis 
inventory cost is written down to market value when cost exceeds market value  which we estimate using current levels of aged and discontinued product and historical analysis of items sold below cost 
lower of cost or market adjustments included in ending inventory at january  and january  were million and million  respectively 
our lower of cost or market adjustments contain uncertainties because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding forecasted consumer demand  the promotional environment  technological obsolescence and consumer preferences 
we have not made any material changes in our inventory valuation methodology during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our lower of cost or market adjustments 
however  if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to losses that could be material 
if we had to take additional markdowns of on all items included in merchandise inventory write downs at january   net income would be affected by approximately million in the fiscal year then ended 
inventory capitalized indirect costs inventory cost includes certain indirect costs related to the purchasing  transportation and warehousing of merchandise 
capitalized indirect costs include freight charges for moving merchandise to warehouses or store locations and operating costs of our merchandising  replenishment and distribution activities 
we recognize indirect costs included in inventory value as an increase in cost of goods sold as the related products are sold 
indirect costs included in inventory value at january  and january  were million and million  respectively 
our capitalized indirect costs contain uncertainties because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment relating to factors of our cost accounting system  the soundness of the underlying principles and their consistent application 
in interim periods  the calculation of capitalized indirect costs requires management to estimate capitalized indirect costs  merchandise purchases and inventory levels for the full fiscal year 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future assumptions or estimates we use to calculate our capitalized indirect costs 
however  if our assumptions or estimates are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a difference in our expenses included in capitalized indirect costs at january  would have affected net income by approximately million in the fiscal year then ended 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions vendor allowances receivable we establish a receivable and reduce inventory cost for income generated from vendor sponsored programs  or vendor allowances  that is earned but not yet received from our vendors  which we calculate based on provisions of the programs in place 
due to the complexity of the individual agreements with vendors  we perform detailed analyses and review historical trends to determine an appropriate level for the vendor allowances receivable 
our receivable for vendor allowances at january  and january  was million and million  respectively  and is included in other current assets 
our vendor allowances receivable contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors  including our ability to collect amounts due from vendors and in interim periods requires management to estimate future inventory purchases 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our vendor allowances receivable during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our vendor allowances receivable 
however  if our assumptions or estimates are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a difference in our estimate of our ability to collect vendor allowances at january  would have affected net income by approximately million in the fiscal year then ended 
costs associated with exit activities we occasionally vacate stores prior to the expiration of the related lease 
for vacated locations that are under long term leases  we record an expense for the net present value of the difference between our future lease payments and related costs eg  real estate taxes and common area maintenance from the date of closure through the end of the remaining lease term  net of expected future sublease rental income 
our estimate of future cash flows is based on our analysis of the specific real estate market  including input from real estate firms  and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict 
costs associated with exit activities included in accrued expenses at january  and january  were million and million  respectively 
our location closing liability contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the duration of future vacancy periods  the amount and timing of future settlement payments  and the amount and timing of potential sublease rental income 
when making these assumptions  management considers a number of factors  including historical settlement experience  the owner of the property  the location and condition of the property  the terms of the underlying lease  the specific marketplace demand and general economic conditions 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our location closing liability during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our location closing liability 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a change in our location closing liability or to our estimated sub lease income at january  would have affected net earnings by approximately million in fiscal year then ended 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions impairment of long lived assets long lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  which are separately tested for impairment  are reviewed and evaluated quarterly 
when evaluating long lived assets for potential impairment  we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we calculate an impairment loss 
the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value  which may be based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value 
if we recognize an impairment loss  the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis 
we may also accelerate depreciation over the asset s revised useful life if it is identified for replacement or abandonment at a specific future date 
in fiscal years and  we recorded non cash charges of million and less than million  respectively  for impairment of long lived assets 
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment in order to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting useful lives of the assets 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluation of long lived assets can vary within a wide range of outcomes 
we believe we have approximately million in net carrying value of assets held for use where an impairment charge is reasonably possible within the next twelve months 
we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to losses that could be material 
deferred tax assets valuation allowance we recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
as we determined that it is more likely than not that the benefit from our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we have a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets of million 
if our assumptions change our valuation allowance contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the future realization of net deferred tax assets 
at year end  we determined that it remained more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would not be realized 
we apply consistent methodologies to assess the need for a valuation allowance each quarter 
although management believes that its judgments and estimates are reasonable  realization of net deferred tax assets ultimately depends on future taxable income 
actual results could differ 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions and we determine we will be able to realize these deferred tax assets the tax benefits related to any reversal of the valuation allowance will be accounted for in the period in which we make such determination 
liabilities for self insurance or high deductible losses we are self insured for certain losses  including those related to employee healthcare 
however  we obtain third party insurance coverage to limit our exposure to these claims 
in other cases  we purchase commercial insurance  such as for workers compensation and general liability claims 
we insure workers compensation losses through a high deductible program  and we recognize our liability for the ultimate payment of incurred claims and claims adjustment expenses by accruing liabilities on an actuarial basis which represent estimates of future amounts necessary to pay claims and related expenses with respect to covered events that have occurred 
when estimating our liabilities relating to self insurance or high deductible insurance programs  we consider a number of factors  including historical claims experience  severity factors and actuarial analysis 
periodically  management reviews its assumptions and the valuations provided by actuarial analysis to determine the adequacy of our self insured liabilities 
liabilities for our self insured losses or high deductible insurance programs contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate these liabilities 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a change in our self insured liabilities and loss reserves relating to high deductible insurance programs at january   would have affected net income by approximately million in the fiscal year then ended 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions share based compensation we have a share based compensation plan under which we award non qualified stock options and restricted stock 
we also have an associate stock buying plan 
for more information  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
we determine the fair value of our non qualified stock option awards at the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
we determine the fair value of our restricted stock awards and associate stock buying plan purchases using similar valuation techniques and the closing market price of our common stock 
option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price  expected dividend yield  future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine share based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to changes in share based compensation expense that could be material 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used  the share based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the share based compensation 
a change in our assumptions  such as volatility or expected term  for share based compensation expense for the fiscal year ended january   would have affected net income by approximately million in the fiscal year then ended 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not undertake any specific actions to diminish our exposure to interest rate or currency rate risk  and we are not a party to any interest rate or currency rate risk management transactions 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments 
at the end of the  we had no outstanding long term debt and as such would not be impacted by a change in interest rates 
in the third quarter of  we entered into a four year  amended and restated loan and security agreement pursuant to which the company has up to million in borrowing capacity 
there are various interest rate options available  for more information  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
a increase in the exchange rate of the us dollar versus the canadian dollar would have an effect of reducing our pre tax income and cash flows by approximately million over the next year
