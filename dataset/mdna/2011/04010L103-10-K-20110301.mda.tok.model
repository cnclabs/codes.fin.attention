our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments 
we invest primarily in first and second lien senior loans and mezzanine debt  which in some cases includes an equity component like warrants 
to a lesser extent  we also make preferred and or common equity investments  which have generally been non control equity investments  of less than million usually in conjunction with a concurrent debt investment 
however  we may increase the size or change the nature of these investments 
also  as a result of the allied acquisition  allied capital equity investments  which included equity investments larger than those we have historically made and controlled portfolio company equity investments  became part of our portfolio 
we intend to actively seek opportunities over time to dispose of certain of the assets that were acquired in the allied acquisition  particularly non yielding equity investments  as well as lower or non yielding debt investments and investments that may not be core to our investment strategy  and generally rotate them into higher yielding first and second lien senior loans and mezzanine debt investments 
however  there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful

however  there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful 
for risks relating to our equity investments  see the risk factors risks relating to our investments investments in equity securities involve a substantial degree of risk 
our investment adviser employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments 
in addition to various risk management and monitoring tools  our investment adviser grades the credit risk of all investments on a scale of to no less frequently than quarterly 
this system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment ie  at the time of acquisition  although it may also take into account under certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company business  the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors 
under this system  investments with a grade of involve the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis 
the trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable  which may include the performance of the portfolio company or a potential exit 
investments graded involve a level of risk to our initial cost basis that is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition 
this portfolio company is generally performing as expected and the risk factors to our ability to ultimately recoup the cost of our investment are neutral to favorable 
all investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a grade of investments graded indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the cost of such investment has increased materially since origination or acquisition  including as a result of factors such as declining performance and non compliance with debt covenants  however  payments are generally not more than days past due 
an investment grade of indicates that the risk to our ability to recoup the cost of such investment has substantially increased since origination or acquisition  and the portfolio company likely has materially declining performance 
for debt investments with an investment grade of  most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent 
for investments graded  it is not anticipated that we will be repaid in an amount equal to our full initial cost basis 
for investments graded or  our investment adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company 
each investment acquired in the allied acquisition was initially assessed a grade of ie  the grade we generally assign a portfolio company at origination or acquisition on april   the date of initial acquisition  reflecting the relative risk to our initial cost basis of such investments 
our investment adviser grades the investments in our portfolio at least each quarter and it is possible that the grade of certain of these portfolio investments may be reduced or increased over time 
set forth below is the grade distribution of our portfolio companies as of december  and dollar amounts in thousands as of december  as of december  dollar amounts in millions fair value number of companies fair value number of companies grade grade grade grade as of december   the weighted average grade of the investments in our portfolio excluding investments acquired in connection with the allied acquisition  the investments in our portfolio acquired in connection with the allied acquisition and the investments in our portfolio as a whole were each the weighted average grade of the investments in our portfolio as of december  was as of december  of our investments excluding investments acquired in connection with the allied acquisition at amortized cost at fair value were on non accrual status  of our investments acquired in connection with the allied acquisition at amortized cost at fair value were on non accrual status  and of the investments in our portfolio as a whole at amortized cost or at fair value were on non accrual status

interest income from investments acquired as part of the allied acquisition was approximately million for the year ended december  the remainder of the increase in interest income was due to an increase in the ares capital investments portfolio which increased from an average of billion at amortized cost for the year ended december  to an average of billion at amortized cost for the comparable period in the increase in capital structuring service fees for the year ended december  was primarily due to the increase in new investment commitments  which increased from million for the year ended december  to billion for the comparable period in the increase in management fees for the year ended december  was primarily due to the management fees earned from the sslp which increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the comparable period in as the sslp increased from approximately million aggregate principal amount of investments at december  to approximately billion principal amount of investments at december  additionally  management fees earned related to investments and management contracts acquired in the allied acquisition were million for the year ended december  the increase in dividend income for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to dividend income from iham which was million for the year ended december  and million for the comparable period in total dividend income for the year ended december  included million of dividends that are non recurring in nature from non income producing equity securities 
for the year ended december   the increase in total investment income from the year ended december  was primarily attributable to an increase in interest income  other income and management fees offset by a decline in capital structuring service fees 
the increase in interest income for the year ended december  was primarily due to the increase in the size of the portfolio as well as increases in the weighted average yield on the portfolio 
the average investments  at amortized cost  for the year increased to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the comparable period in the decrease in capital structuring service fees was primarily due to the decrease in new investment commitments  which declined from million for the year ended december  to million for the comparable period in operating expenses for the year ended december  in millions interest and credit facility fees incentive management fees base management fees professional fees and other costs related to the allied acquisition professional fees administrative fees other general and administrative total operating expenses interest and credit facility fees for the years ended december  and  were comprised of the following for the year ended december  in millions stated interest expense facility fees amortization of debt issuance costs accretion of discount related to allied unsecured notes total interest and credit facility fees stated interest expense increased due to the increase in our principal debt outstanding and an increase in our weighted average stated interest rate

incentive and base management fees increased primarily due to the increase in the size of the portfolio and in the case of the incentive fees  the related increase in net investment income as well as the net appreciation of the investment portfolio 
in we did not incur a capital gains fee under the investment advisory and management agreement  however  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we accrued million in incentive management fees as a result of the unrealized appreciation in the portfolio see note to the company consolidated financial statements

other general and administrative expenses include rent  insurance  depreciation  directors fees and other costs 
the increase in professional fees and other costs related to the allied acquisition was primarily as a result of the completion of the allied acquisition in and the occurrence of various closing and transition related costs following the allied acquisition 
the increases in professional fees  administrative fees and other general and administrative expenses were primarily due to the increase in the size of the company following the allied acquisition and the various costs of managing a larger portfolio 
for the year ended december   the decline in total expenses from the year ended december  was primarily attributable to a decline in interest and credit facility fees offset by professional fees and other costs related to the allied acquisition that were not incurred in and an increase in incentive management fees 
interest expense and credit facility fees decreased despite increases in the principal debt outstanding for the period 
the average principal debt outstanding during the year ended december  was million compared to average principal debt outstanding borrowings of million for the comparable period in the increase in principal debt outstanding was more than offset by the decline in the weighted average stated interest rate which went from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  incentive fees related to pre incentive fee net investment income increased primarily due to the increase in the size of the portfolio and the related increase in net investment income

realized gains or losses are computed using the specific identification method 
unrealized gains or losses reflect the change in investment values  including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses when gains or losses are realized 
investments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at such market quotations 
in order to validate market quotations  we look at a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value  including the source and nature of the quotations 
debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available ie  substantially all of our investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors  based on the input of our investment adviser  audit committee and independent third party valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of our board of directors to assist in the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation at least once during a trailing month period  and under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process 
the valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter  and a minimum of of our portfolio at fair value is subject to review by an independent valuation firm each quarter 
as part of the valuation process  we may take into account the following types of factors  if relevant  in determining the fair value of our investments the enterprise value of a portfolio company an estimate of the total fair value of the portfolio company debt and equity  the nature and realizable value of any collateral  the portfolio company ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow  the markets in which the portfolio company does business  a comparison of the portfolio company securities to any similar publicly traded securities  changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets generally that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future and other relevant factors 
when an external event such as a purchase transaction  public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs  we consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate our valuation 
because there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in our portfolio  we value substantially all of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors as described herein 
due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value  the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period 
additionally  the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize 
further  such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities 
if we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale  we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded it 
in addition  changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the gains or losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned 
see risk factors risks relating to our investments recent unprecedented declines in market prices and liquidity in the corporate debt markets resulted in significant net unrealized depreciation of our portfolio in the recent past  reducing our net asset value  and such conditions may occur again in the future 
our board of directors undertakes a multi step valuation process each quarter  as described below our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment in conjunction with our portfolio management team 
preliminary valuations are reviewed and discussed with our investment adviser management and investment professionals  and then valuation recommendations are presented to our board of directors 
the audit committee of our board of directors reviews these valuations  as well as the input of independent third party valuation firms with respect to the valuations of a minimum of of our portfolio at fair value 
our board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio without a readily available market quotation in good faith based on the input of our investment adviser  audit committee and where applicable  independent third party valuation firms

in the ordinary course of business  allied capital had issued guarantees on behalf of certain portfolio companies 
under these arrangements  payments would be required to be made to third parties if the portfolio companies were to default on their related payment 
as part of the allied acquisition  the company assumed such outstanding guarantees or similar obligations 
as a result  as of december   the company had outstanding guarantees or similar obligations totaling million 
as of december   one of the company portfolio companies  ciena capital llc ciena  had one non recourse securitization small business administration sba loan warehouse facility  which has reached its maturity date but remains outstanding 
ciena is working with the providers of the sba loan warehouse facility with regard to the repayment of that facility 
allied capital had previously issued a performance guaranty which ares capital succeeded to as a result of the allied acquisition whereby ares capital must indemnify the warehouse providers for any damages  losses  liabilities and related costs and expenses that they may incur as a result of ciena failure to perform any of its obligations as loan originator  loan seller or loan servicer under the warehouse facility 
as of december   there are no known issues or claims with respect to this performance guaranty 
recent developments on january   we and ares capital cp amended the revolving funding facility to  among other things  provide for a three year reinvestment period until january  with two one year extension options  subject to our and our lenders consent and extend the stated maturity date to january  with two one year extension options  subject to our and our lenders consent 
in january  we issued million of the convertible notes 
the convertible notes bear interest at rate of per year  payable semiannually 
in certain circumstances  the convertible notes will be convertible into cash  shares of ares capital common stock or a combination of cash and shares of ares capital common stock  at ares capital election  at an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of the convertible notes  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of ares capital common stock  subject to customary anti dilution adjustments 
the initial conversion price is approximately above the per share closing price of ares capital common stock on january  ares capital does not have the right to redeem the convertible notes prior to maturity 
the convertible notes will mature on february   unless repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date 
in accounting for the convertible notes  the company estimated at the time of issuance that the values of the debt and equity components of the notes were and  respectively 
the original issue discount equal to the estimated equity component of of the convertible notes will initially be recorded in capital in excess of par value in the balance sheet 
as a result  the company will record interest expense comprised of both stated interest expense as well as accretion of the original issue discount resulting in an estimated effective interest rate of 
on february  we notified the holders of our notes that we are redeeming the million aggregate principal amount of our notes remaining outstanding  together with a redemption premium  in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the notes 
we expect the redemption to be completed on march  effective as of february   we amended our charter to increase the number of shares of common stock we are authorized to issue from million to million 
as of february  we had made new investment commitments of million  all of which were funded  since december  of these new commitments  were in investments in subordinated notes of the sslp  were in second lien senior secured debt and were in equity securities

also  of the million of investments exited since december   million were investments acquired as part of the allied acquisition including million that were on non accrual status and million that were non interest earning 
additionally  we recognized net realized gains of approximately million on the investments exited that were acquired as part of the allied acquisition  including a realized gain of million from the sale of investments in collateralized loan obligations 
in addition  as of february   we had an investment backlog and pipeline of million and million  respectively 
we may syndicate a portion of these investments and commitments to third parties 
the consummation of any of the investments in this backlog and pipeline depends upon  among other things satisfactory completion of our due diligence investigation of the prospective portfolio company  our acceptance of the terms and structure of such investment and the execution and delivery of satisfactory transaction documentation 
we cannot assure you that we will make any of these investments or that we will syndicate any portion of such investments and commitments

interest and dividend income recognition interest income  adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount  is recorded on an accrual basis 
discounts from and premiums to par value on securities purchased are accreted amortized into interest income over the life of the respective security using the effective yield method 
the amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums  if any 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due days or more or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full 
accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non accrual status 
interest payments received on non accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management judgment regarding collectability 
non accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and  in management judgment  are likely to remain current 
the company may make exceptions to this if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection 
dividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected 
dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies 
payment in kind interest the company has loans in its portfolio that contain pik provisions 
the pik interest  computed at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement  is added to the principal balance of the loan and recorded as interest income 
to maintain the company status as a ric  this non cash source of income must be paid out to stockholders in the form of dividends even though the company has not yet collected the cash 
capital structuring service fees and other income the company investment adviser seeks to provide assistance to our portfolio companies in connection with the company investments and in return the company may receive fees for capital structuring services 
these fees are generally only available to the company as a result of the company underlying investments  are normally paid at the closing of the investments  are generally non recurring and are recognized as revenue when earned upon closing of the investment 
the services that the company investment adviser provides vary by investment  but generally consist of reviewing existing credit facilities  arranging bank financing  arranging equity financing  structuring financing from multiple lenders  structuring financing from multiple equity investors  restructuring existing loans  raising equity and debt capital  and providing general financial advice  which concludes upon closing of the investment 
any services of the above nature subsequent to the closing would generally generate a separate fee payable to the company 
in certain instances where the company is invited to participate as a co lender in a transaction and does not provide significant services in connection with the investment  a portion of loan fees paid to the company in such situations will be deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the loan 
the company investment adviser may also take a seat on the board of directors of a portfolio company  or observe the meetings of the board of directors without taking a formal seat 
other income includes fees for asset management  management and consulting services  loan guarantees  commitments  amendments and other services rendered by the company to portfolio companies 
such fees are recognized as income when earned or the services are rendered 
foreign currency translation the company books and records are maintained in us dollars 
any foreign currency amounts are translated into us dollars on the following basis market value of investment securities  other assets and liabilities at the exchange rates prevailing at the end of the period 
purchases and sales of investment securities  income and expenses at the exchange rates prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions  income or expenses 
results of operations based on changes in foreign exchange rates are separately disclosed in the statement of operations 
foreign security and currency translations may involve certain considerations and risks not typically associated with investing in us companies and us government securities 
these risks include  but are not limited to  currency fluctuation and revaluations and future adverse political  social and economic developments  which could cause investments in foreign markets to be less liquid and prices more volatile than those of comparable us companies or us government securities 
accounting for derivative instruments the company does not utilize hedge accounting and marks its derivatives to market through operations 
equity offering expenses the company offering costs  excluding underwriters fees  are charged against the proceeds from equity offerings when received 
debt issuance costs debt issuance costs are being amortized over the life of the related debt instrument using the straight line method  which closely approximates the effective yield method 
us federal income taxes the company has elected to be treated as a ric under subchapter m of the code and operates in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to rics 
to qualify as a ric  the company must  among other things  timely distribute to its stockholders at least of investment company taxable income  as defined by the code  for each year 
the company  among other things  has made and intends to continue to make the requisite distributions to its stockholders  which will generally relieve the company from us federal income taxes 
depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year  we may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions into the next tax year and pay a excise tax on such income  as required 
to the extent that the company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions  the company accrues excise tax  if any  on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned 
certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries are subject to us federal and state income taxes 
dividends to common stockholders dividends and distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the record date 
the amount to be paid out as a dividend is determined by our board of directors each quarter and is generally based upon the earnings estimated by management 
net realized capital gains  if any  are generally distributed at least annually  although we may decide to retain such capital gains for investment 
we have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of any distributions we declare in cash on behalf of our stockholders  unless a stockholder elects to receive cash 
as a result  if our board of directors authorizes  and we declare  a cash dividend  then our stockholders who have not opted out of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash dividends automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock  rather than receiving the cash dividend 
while we generally use newly issued shares to implement the dividend reinvestment plan especially if our shares are trading at a premium to net asset value  we may purchase shares in the open market in connection with our obligations under the dividend reinvestment plan 
in particular  if our shares are trading at a significant enough discount to net asset value and we are otherwise permitted under applicable law to purchase such shares  we intend to purchase shares in the open market in connection with our obligations under our dividend reinvestment plan 
use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of actual and contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income or loss and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates include the valuation of investments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and the valuations of our investment portfolio 
interest rate risk interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates 
because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings  our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income 
see risk factors we are exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates 
as of december   approximately of the investments at fair value in our portfolio were at fixed rates  approximately were at variable rates  were non interest earning and were on non accrual status 
additionally  for the investments at variable rates  of the investments contain interest rate floors representing of total investments at fair value 
the revolving credit facility  the revolving funding facility and the debt securitization all bear interest at variable rates with no interest rate floors  while the unsecured notes and the convertible notes bear interest at fixed rates 
we regularly measure our exposure to interest rate risk 
we assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities 
based on that review  we determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates 
while hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates  certain hedging transactions that we may enter into in the future  such as interest rate swap agreements  may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio investments 
based on our december  balance sheet  the following table shows the annual impact on net income of base rate changes in interest rates considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure in millions basis point change interest income interest expense net income up basis points up basis points up basis points down basis points down basis points down basis points based on our december  balance sheet  the following table shows the impact on net income of base rate changes in interest rates assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure and reflecting the effect of our interest rate swap agreement described above and in note of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  in millions basis point change interest income interest expense net income up basis points up basis points up basis points down basis points down basis points down basis points
