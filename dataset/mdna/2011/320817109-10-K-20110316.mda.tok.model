critical accounting policies generally accepted accounting principles require management to apply significant judgment to certain accounting  reporting and disclosure matters 
management must use assumptions and estimates to apply those principles where actual measurement is not possible or practical

on march   the corporation entered into securities purchase agreements with six groups of institutional investors  pursuant to which the corporation sold an aggregate of  shares of its common stock in exchange for gross proceeds of approximately million 
the purchase price for each share of common stock was 
the common stock was issued and registered pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed with the securities and exchange commission  in connection with a takedown from the corporation s shelf registration statement on form s file no 
 which was declared effective by the sec on may  on june   the corporation completed an exchange of  shares of the corporation s series a preferred stock held by the treasury for  in aggregate principal amount of trust preferred securities issued through the corporation s wholly owned subsidiary trust  first merchants capital trust iii 
the trust preferred securities qualify as tier capital  subject to the percent aggregate limitation on tier capital for these and similar securities 
after the completed exchange  the treasury continues to hold  shares of series a preferred stock along with warrants to purchase up to  shares of the corporation s common stock also issued pursuant to tarp 
see note exchange of preferred stock held by the treasury for trust preferred securities  to the notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k for additional information 
the preferred stock and the trust preferred securities have priority in the payment of dividends and interest over any cash dividends paid to common stockholders 
the adoption of arra permits the corporation to redeem the preferred stock without penalty and without the need to raise new capital  subject to the treasury s consultation with the occ 
the warrant has a year term and is immediately exercisable upon its issuance 
the net proceeds of the original sale were allocated between the preferred shares and the warrant based on relative fair value 
the preferred shares are accreted to liquidation value over the expected life of the shares  with accretion charged to retained earnings 
the accretion is charged to retained earnings using a level yield methodology and a discount rate of percent 
accretion was charged to retained earnings to bring the cancelled shares to liquidation value at the time of the exchange with the treasury 
management is currently evaluating various methods for repayment of cpp 
the most immediate method is through earnings growth and capital retention  as evidenced by a reduction in the dividend paid to common shareholders 
dividends per share were reduced from per share in december to per share for each quarter during the terms of the cpp also prevent the corporation from declaring a quarterly dividend on its common stock in excess of per share without the prior consent of the treasury department 
management believes that all of the above capital ratios are meaningful measurements for evaluating the safety and soundness of the corporation

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations loan quality the corporation s primary business focus is small business and middle market commercial and residential real estate  auto and small consumer lending  which results in portfolio diversification 
commercial loans are individually underwritten and judgmentally risk rated 
they are periodically monitored and prompt corrective actions are taken on deteriorating loans 
retail loans are typically underwritten with statistical decision making tools and are managed throughout their life cycle on a portfolio basis 
at december   non performing loans totaled  a decrease of  from december  loans days past due  other than non accrual and renegotiated loans  decreased by  the amount of non accrual loans totaled  at december  non performing loans will increase or decrease going forward due to portfolio growth  routine problem loan recognition and resolution through collections  sales or charge offs 
the performance of any loan can be affected by external factors  such as economic conditions  or internal factors  such as actions of a borrower s management 
the corporation s coverage ratio of allowance for loan losses to non accrual loans increased from percent at december  to percent at december  charge offs only impact the coverage ratio to the extent a charge off is recorded in the same reporting period the charged off loan is moved from accruing to non accruing 
see additional information in the provision allowance for loan losses section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form k 
in years prior to  the corporation globally included all classified loans  including substandard  doubtful and loss credits in impaired loans 
at december   management refined the definition of impaired loans to be more specific and include all non accrual loans  renegotiated loans  as well as substandard  doubtful and loss grade loans that were deemed impaired according to guidance set forth in asc a loan is deemed impaired when  based on current information or events  it is probable that all amounts due of principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected 
at december   impaired loans totaled  a specific allowance for losses was not deemed necessary for a subset of impaired loans totaling  but a specific allowance of  was recorded for the remaining balance of  and is included in the corporation s allowance for loan losses at december  the average balance of the total aforementioned impaired loans for was  in connection with economic developments during the past two years  many financial institutions have experienced unusual and significant declines in the performance of their loan portfolios 
the values of real estate collateral supporting many loans declined  one result of which was increase charge offs 
while the corporation s non performing and impaired loan totals have improved in  further deterioration of housing and real estate values may result in continued elevated levels of loan delinquencies and credit losses 
although the corporation believes its underwriting and loan review procedures are appropriate for the various kinds of loans it makes  its results of operations and its financial condition could be adversely affected in the event the quality of its loan portfolio deteriorates 
in  total net charge offs were  a decrease of  from of  the corporation incurred eight commercial loan charge offs over million in totaling  or percent  of total net charge offs for the year

five additional large recoveries totaling  were recognized during the year 
the remaining seven charge offs totaling  were made up of  in commercial and development real estate  and  real estate construction 
in  new home construction weakened  home values declined  and construction and land development continued to decline  all of which resulted in a deterioration in values and subsequently charge offs of loans to builders and developers

the provision for loan losses in was  a decrease of  from  in  reflecting a decrease of  in net charge offs during the year 
the amount actually provided for loan losses in any period may be greater than or less than net loan losses  based on management s judgment as to the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses 
the determination of the provision in any period is based on management s continuing review and evaluation of the loan portfolio  and its judgment as to the impact of current economic conditions on the portfolio 
the amount provided for loan losses and the determination of the adequacy of the allowance are based on a continuous review of the loan portfolio  including an internally administered loan watch list and an independent loan review 
the evaluation takes into consideration identified credit problems  as well as the possibility of losses inherent in the loan portfolio that are not specifically identified 
see the critical accounting policies section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form k 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio at december  the process for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is critical to the corporation s financial results 
it requires management to make difficult  subjective and complex judgments  as estimates about the effect of uncertain matters are needed 
the allowance for loan losses considers current factors  including economic conditions and ongoing internal and external examination processes and will increase or decrease as deemed necessary to ensure the allowance for loan losses remains adequate 
in addition  the allowance as a percentage of charge offs and nonperforming loans will change at different points in time based on credit performance  loan mix and collateral values 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was  a decrease of  from year end as a percent of loans  the allowance increased to percent at december  from percent at december  during  the allowance decreased due to a  decrease in specific reserves against impaired loans  partially offset by a  increase in the asc  contingencies  allocation for loans not deemed impaired according to guidance set forth in asc part ii item and item a 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provision allowance for loan losses continued the allowance as a percent of loans increased from year end reflecting the continued impact of the difficult economic environment on the corporation s loan portfolio in loans are generally secured by specific items of collateral  including real property and business assets 
the fair value for impaired loans is measured based on the value of the collateral securing those loans and is determined using several methods 
the fair value of real estate is generally determined based on appraisals by qualified licensed appraisers 
the appraisers typically determine the value of the real estate by utilizing an income or market valuation approach 
updated as is or liquidation value appraisals are obtained as individual circumstances and or market conditions warrant 
partially charged off loans measured for impairment based on their collateral value are generally not returned to performing status subsequent to receiving updated appraisals or restructure of the loan 
if an appraisal is not available  the fair value may be determined by using a cash flow analysis 
fair value on other collateral such as business assets is typically valued by using the financial information such as financial statements and aging reports provided by the borrower 
both appraised values and values based on borrower s financial information are discounted as considered appropriate based on age and quality of the information and current market conditions 
loans deemed impaired according to guidance set forth in asc are evaluated during problem loan meetings held within each reporting period by a special assets management team 
loan collateral and customer financial information are reviewed and the level of impairment is assessed to determine appropriate and accurate reserve and or charge off amounts 
loans or portions of loans are charged off when they are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as an asset is not warranted 
it is the corporation s policy to recognize losses promptly to prevent overstatement of assets  earnings and capital 
the following table summarizes loan loss reserves loan segment dollars in thousands december  allowance balances commercial commercial real estate consumer residential finance leases total individually evaluated for impairment collectively evaluated for impairment acquired with deteriorated credit quality total allowance for loan losses dollars in thousands december  allowance balances commercial commercial real estate consumer residential finance leases total individually evaluated for impairment collectively evaluated for impairment acquired with deteriorated credit quality total allowance for loan losses during  the reserve allocation for non impaired commercial criticized loans increased  from year end the historical reserve allocation for non criticized loans decreased  from december  the historical loss allocation for loans not deemed impaired according to asc is the product of the volume of loans within the non impaired criticized and non criticized risk grade classifications  each segmented by call code  and the historical loss factor for each respective classification and call code segment 
the historical loss factors are based upon actual loss experience within each risk and call code classification 
in  the historical look back period for non criticized loans was shortened from quarters to the most recent rolling four quarter average and now aligns with the look up back period for non impaired criticized loans 
each of the rolling four quarter periods used to obtain the average  include all charge offs for the previous twelve month period  therefore the historical look back period goes back quarters 
the resulting allocation is more reflective of current conditions 
criticized loans are grouped based on the risk grade assigned to the loan 
loans with a special mention grade are assigned a loss factor and loans with a classified grade but not impaired are assigned a separate loss factor 
in  the loss factor computation for this allocation was enhanced with a segmented historical loss migration analysis of non impaired criticized risk grades to charge off 
given the rapid economic decline in and the resulting increases in both non impaired criticized loans and net charge offs  this allocation adjusted upward in to reflect the increased level of risk that management associated with non impaired loans in the criticized risk category 
in addition to the specific reserves and historical loss components of the allowance  consideration is given to various environmental factors to help ensure that losses inherent in the portfolio are reflected in the allowance for loan losses 
the environmental component adjusts the historical loss allocations for commercial and consumer loans to reflect relevant current conditions that  in management s opinion  have an impact on loss recognition 
environmental factors that management reviews in the analysis include national and local economic trends and conditions  trends in growth in the loan portfolio and growth in higher risk areas  levels of  and trends in  delinquencies and non accruals  experience and depth of lending management and staff  adequacy of  and adherence to  lending policies and procedures including those for underwriting  industry concentrations of credit  and adequacy of risk identification systems and controls through the internal loan review and internal audit processes 
each environmental factor receives an individual qualitative allocation that  in management s opinion  reflects losses inherent in the portfolio that are not reflected in the historical loss components of the allowance 
at december   the allocation related to environmental considerations totaled  as mentioned in the critical accounting policies  the corporation s primary market areas for lending are central indiana and butler  franklin and hamilton counties in ohio 
when evaluating the adequacy of allowance  consideration is given to this regional geographic concentration and the closely associated effect changing economic conditions have on the corporation s customers 
in management s opinion  the allowance for loan losses at december  is reflective of both the banking environment within the corporation s footprint and the corporation s recent loan and loss trends 
part ii item and item a 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations goodwill during  the impact of deteriorating economic conditions had significantly impacted the banking industry and the financial results of the corporation 
as a result  while only required to test goodwill annually  the corporation decided to test its goodwill for impairment on three separate occasions during in  the corporation returned to its annual testing of goodwill for impairment  most recently as of november  the financial markets continue to reflect significantly lower valuations for the stocks of financial institutions  when compared to historic valuation metrics  largely driven by both the constriction in available credit and the losses suffered related to residential mortgage markets 
additionally  many bank stocks with geographic exposure in certain markets  including indiana  have been depressed 
much of the depression also seems to be related to the need for certain financial institutions to obtain fresh capital to replace capital lost due to asset write downs 
the demand for fresh capital appears to be at least temporarily affecting the valuations placed on other banks with adequate capital reserves 
the tarp program has attempted to address this inadequate capital issue  however  the markets view tarp as very temporary 
the corporation s stock activity  as well as the price  has been adversely impacted by the economic conditions affecting the banking industry in and management has concluded that trading value of the stock price is not indicative or reflective of fair value per asc  fair value measurements and disclosures for the following reasons the corporation s minimal free float driven by large index fund positions  coupled with meaningful long term retail holdings  has created unusual volatility in the stock price given modest fundamental changes in demand and appears to be impacting the price as well 
lower trading volumes have also put downward pressure on the corporation s stock price 
the average daily volume of the corporation s stock for the  as a percent of average outstanding shares  was more than percent less than the average daily volume during the two step goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of impairment loss to be recognized  if any 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the test is not necessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed to measure impairment loss  if any 
under the second step  the fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value 
this allocation is similar to a purchase price allocation performed in purchase accounting 
if the implied goodwill value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the corporation used an independent  outside firm to help determine the fair value of the corporation for purposes of the first step of the impairment test 
the discounted earnings method an income approach as well as the guideline publicly traded company method and the transaction method both market approaches that apply market multiples to various financial metrics to derive value were used and weighted to form the conclusion of fair value 
the discounted earnings method was given primary weight in the fair value analysis 
the discounted earnings method was based primarily on management projections derived from expected balance sheet and income statement assumptions  based on current economic conditions  which continue to show signs of stabilization from  improvements in and continued improvements going forward  present value factors based on an implied market cost of equity  and  historic long term price to earnings multiples for comparable companies 
determining the corporation s fair value using the discounted earnings method involves a significant amount of judgment 
the methodology is largely based on unobservable level three inputs 
the test results are dependent upon attaining actual financial results consistent with the forecasts and assumptions used in the valuation model 
the discounted earnings method relied on a terminal price earnings p e multiple 
the p e multiple used to determine terminal value was notably lower than the historic p e multiple observed for the corporation  the peer group  and the nasdaq community banking index abaq 
based on the results of the step one analysis  the fair value exceeded the corporation s carrying value  therefore  it was concluded goodwill is not impaired 
additionally  a sensitivity analysis was performed on the discounted earnings methodology by testing a range of the following metrics implied market cost of equity  and historic long term price to earnings multiples for comparable companies 
based on the sensitivity testing  at the low end of the sensitivity test range for both metrics  fair value of the corporation exceeded its carrying value 
for reasons that include but are not limited to the aforementioned  management believes the corporation s recently traded stock price is not indicative of fair value 
part ii item and item a 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity liquidity management is the process by which the corporation ensures that adequate liquid funds are available for the holding company and its subsidiaries 
these funds are necessary in order to meet financial commitments on a timely basis 
these commitments include withdrawals by depositors  funding credit obligations to borrowers  paying dividends to stockholders  paying operating expenses  funding capital expenditures  and maintaining deposit reserve requirements 
liquidity is monitored and closely managed by the asset liability committee 
the corporation s liquidity is dependent upon the receipt of dividends from the bank  which are subject to certain regulatory limitations and access to other funding sources 
liquidity of the bank is derived primarily from core deposit growth  principal payments received on loans  the sale and maturity of investment securities  net cash provided by operating activities  and access to other funding sources 
the most stable source of liability funded liquidity for both the long term and short term is deposit growth and retention in the core deposit base 
in addition  federal home loan bank fhlb advances are utilized as funding sources 
at december   total borrowings from the fhlb were  the bank has pledged certain mortgage loans and investments to the fhlb 
the total available remaining borrowing capacity from the fhlb at december  was  the bank currently has million of percent senior notes the notes that are guaranteed by the fdic under its temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp and are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states 
including the fdic fee  underwriting  legal and accounting expenses  the effective rate on the notes is percent 
the notes are due march  the notes are issued by the bank and are not obligations of  or guaranteed by  the corporation 
in connection with the fdic s tlgp  the bank entered into a master agreement with the fdic that contains  among other things  certain terms and conditions that must be included in the governing documents for any senior debt securities issued by the bank that are guaranteed pursuant to the fdic s tlgp 
for further discussion  see note borrowings  to the notes consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
the principal source of asset funded liquidity is investment securities classified as available for sale  the market values of which totaled  at december   an increase of  or percent  above december  securities classified as held to maturity that are maturing within a short period of time can also be a source of liquidity 
securities classified as held to maturity and that are maturing in one year or less totaled  at december  in addition  other types of assets such as cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell  and loans and interest bearing deposits with other banks maturing within one year are sources of liquidity 
the corporation currently has a million credit facility with bank of america  na comprised of a a term loan in the principal amount of million the term loan and b a subordinated debenture in the principal amount of million the subordinated debt 
pursuant to the terms of the underlying loan agreement the loan agreement  the term loan and the subordinated debt each mature on february  the term loan is secured by a pledge of all of the issued and outstanding shares of the bank 
the loan agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties and financial and negative covenants 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the loan agreement 
at december   the corporation has failed to comply with a financial covenant in the loan agreement requiring the corporation to maintain  on an annualized basis  a minimum return on average total assets of at least percent 
the loan agreement provides that upon an event of default as the result of the corporation s failure to comply with a financial covenant  bank of america may a declare the million outstanding principal amount of the term loan immediately due and payable  b exercise all of its rights and remedies at law  in equity and or pursuant to any or all collateral documents  including foreclosing on the collateral if payment of the term loan is not made in full  and c add a default rate of percent per annum to the term loan 
because the subordinated debt is treated as tier capital for regulatory capital purposes  the loan agreement does not provide bank of america with any right of acceleration or other remedies with regard to the subordinated debt upon an event of default caused by the corporation s breach of a financial covenant 
to date  bank of america has chosen to apply the default rate  but not to accelerate the term loan based on the corporation s failure to meet these financial covenants 
in the normal course of business  the bank is a party to a number of other off balance sheet activities that contain credit  market and operational risk that are not reflected in whole or in part in the consolidated financial statements 
such activities include traditional off balance sheet credit related financial instruments  commitments under operating leases and long term debt 
the bank provides customers with off balance sheet credit support through loan commitments and standby letters of credit 
summarized credit related financial instruments at december  are as follows december  dollars in thousands amounts of commitments loan commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit since many of the commitments are expected to expire unused or be only partially used  the total amount of unused commitments in the preceding table does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
part ii item and item a 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity continued in addition to owned banking facilities  the corporation has entered into a number of long term leasing arrangements to support ongoing activities 
the required payments under such commitments and borrowings at december  are as follows dollars in thousands and after total operating leases securities sold under repurchase agreements federal home loan bank advances subordinated debentures  revolving credit lines and term loans total interest sensitivity and disclosures about market risk asset liability management has been an important factor in the corporation ability to record consistent earnings growth through periods of interest rate volatility and product deregulation 
management and the board of directors monitor the corporation liquidity and interest sensitivity positions at regular meetings to review how changes in interest rates may affect earnings 
decisions regarding investment and the pricing of loan and deposit products are made after analysis of reports designed to measure liquidity  rate sensitivity  the corporation s exposure to changes in net interest income given various rate scenarios and the economic and competitive environments 
it is the objective of the corporation to monitor and manage risk exposure to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates 
it is the goal of the corporation s asset liability function to provide optimum and stable net interest income 
to accomplish this  management uses two asset liability tools 
gap interest rate sensitivity reports and net interest income simulation modeling are constructed  presented and monitored quarterly 
management believes that the corporation liquidity and interest sensitivity position at december   remained adequate to meet the corporation s primary goal of achieving optimum interest margins while avoiding undue interest rate risk 
the following table presents the corporation s interest rate sensitivity analysis as of december  at december  dollars in thousands days days years beyond years total rate sensitive assets federal funds sold interest bearing deposits investment securities loans federal reserve and federal home loan bank stock total rate sensitive assets rate sensitive liabilities interest bearing deposits securities sold under repurchase agreements federal home loan bank advances subordinated debentures  revolving credit lines and term loans total rate sensitive liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap by period cumulative rate sensitivity gap cumulative rate sensitivity gap ratio at december  at december  the corporation had a cumulative negative gap of  in the one year horizon at december   or percent  of total assets 
the corporation places its greatest credence in net interest income simulation modeling 
the above gap interest rate sensitivity report is believed by the corporation management to have two major shortfalls 
the gap interest rate sensitivity report fails to precisely gauge how often an interest rate sensitive product reprices  nor is it able to measure the magnitude of potential future rate movements 
net interest income simulation modeling  or earnings at risk  measures the sensitivity of net interest income to various interest rate movements 
the corporation asset liability process monitors simulated net interest income under three separate interest rate scenarios  base  rising and falling 
estimated net interest income for each scenario is calculated over a month horizon 
the immediate and parallel changes to the base case scenario used in the model are presented below 
the interest rate scenarios are used for analytical purposes and do not necessarily represent management view of future market movements 
rather  these are intended to provide a measure of the degree of volatility interest rate movements may introduce into the earnings of the corporation

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations interest sensitivity and disclosures about market risk continued the base scenario is highly dependent on numerous assumptions embedded in the model  including assumptions related to future interest rates 
while the base sensitivity analysis incorporates management best estimate of interest rate and balance sheet dynamics under various market rate movements  the actual behavior and resulting earnings impact will likely differ from that projected 
for certain assets  the base simulation model captures the expected prepayment behavior under changing interest rate environments 
assumptions and methodologies regarding the interest rate or balance behavior of indeterminate maturity products  such as savings  money market  now and demand deposits  reflect management best estimate of expected future behavior 
the comparative rising basis points and falling basis points scenarios below  as of december   assume further interest rate changes in addition to the base simulation discussed above 
these changes are immediate and parallel changes to the base case scenario 
in the current rate environment  many driver rates are at or near historical lows  thus total rate movements beginning point minus ending point to each of the various driver rates utilized by management have the following results at december  rising falling driver rates basis points basis points prime federal funds one year cmt three year cmt five year cmt cd fhlb results for the base  rising basis points  and falling basis points interest rate scenarios are listed below based upon the corporation s rate sensitive assets and liabilities at december  the net interest income shown represents cumulative net interest income over a month time horizon

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations earning assets the following table presents the earning asset mix as of december   and december  earnings assets decreased by  this decrease was driven by a decline in loans totaling  all loan segments saw declines with the largest declines in commercial and industrial  residential real estate and construction 
investments increased by approximately  as loans declined  the corporation used the liquidity to increase the investment portfolio

further discussion regarding fhlb advances is included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading liquidity 
additionally  the interest rate risk is included as part of the corporation s interest simulation discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading interest sensitivity and disclosures about market risk 
net interest income net interest income is the primary source of the corporation s earnings 
it is a function of net interest margin and the level of average earning assets 
the following table presents the corporation s asset yields  interest expense  and net interest income as a percent of average earning assets for the three year period ending in in  asset yields decreased basis points on a fully taxable equivalent basis fte and interest cost decreased basis points  resulting in a basis point increase in the interest margin compared to a decrease in earning assets  primarily due a smaller loan portfolio and a decline in interest bearing liabilities  produced a negative volume variance of  fte 
in addition  a declining interest rate environment produced a negative rate variance of  resulting in a decrease of  in net interest income 
in  asset yields decreased basis points on a fully taxable equivalent basis fte and interest cost decreased basis points  resulting in a basis point decrease in the interest margin compared to growth in earning assets  primarily due to the lincoln acquisition on december   produced a positive volume variance of  fte  and a declining interest rate environment produced a negative rate variance of  resulting in an increase of  in net interest income

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations income taxes income tax benefit totaled  for compared to a benefit of  for the corporation s federal statutory income tax rate is percent and its state tax rate varies from to percent depending on the state in which the subsidiary company is domiciled 
the corporation s effective tax rate is lower than the blended effective statutory federal and state rates primarily due to the corporation s income on tax exempt securities and loans  income generated by the subsidiaries domiciled in a state with no state or local income tax  income tax credits generated from investments in affordable housing projects  tax exempt earnings from bank owned life insurance contracts and reduced state taxes  resulting from the effect of state income apportionment 
the reconciliation of federal statutory to actual tax expense is shown in note income tax  in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
the corporation s tax asset  deferred and receivable decreased from  at december  to  at december  the corporation received net refunds during of  the refunds were a result of federal estimated tax payments being returned and the carry back of the net operating loss to the tax year 
the corporation anticipates additional refunds totaling  in the first quarter of in addition  the corporation s net deferred tax asset has decreased from  at december  to  at december  this change is primarily driven from the decrease in the timing differences associated with the deductibility of the provision for loan losses  pensions  and other employee benefits 
the corporation has recorded a valuation allowance of  related to deferred state taxes as it does not anticipate having future state taxable income sufficient to fully utilize the deferred state tax asset 
this is primarily due to the corporation s current tax structure as noted above 
no valuation allowance has been recorded against the federal deferred tax asset as the corporation anticipates full utilization 
inflation changing prices of goods  services and capital affect the financial position of every business enterprise 
the level of market interest rates and the price of funds loaned or borrowed fluctuate due to changes in the rate of inflation and various other factors  including government monetary policy 
fluctuating interest rates affect the corporation s net interest income and loan volume 
as the inflation rate increases  the purchasing power of the dollar decreases 
those holding fixed rate monetary assets incur a loss  while those holding fixed rate monetary liabilities enjoy a gain 
the nature of a financial holding company s operations is such that there will generally be an excess of monetary assets over monetary liabilities  and  thus  a financial holding company will tend to suffer from an increase in the rate of inflation and benefit from a decrease
