item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  judgment and assumptions 
you should review the risk factors section of this annual report on form k for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
certain abbreviated key terms have the meanings defined elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview heartware develops and manufactures small implantable heart pumps  or ventricular assist devices  for the treatment of advanced heart failure 
the heartware ventricular assist system the heartware system  which includes a left ventricular assist device lvad  or blood pump  patient accessories and surgical tools  is designed to provide circulatory support for patients in the advanced stage of heart failure 
the core of the heartware system is a proprietary continuous flow blood pump  the hvad pump  which is a full output device capable of pumping up to liters of blood per minute 
the heartware system is designed to be implanted adjacent to the heart  avoiding the abdominal surgery generally required to implant similar devices 
in  we have received ce marking for the heartware system in the european union allowing for commercial sale and distribution of our device 
in the us  the device is the subject of clinical trials for two indications bridge to transplant under a cap and destination therapy 
our device is also available in other countries around the world under special access programs 
recent key milestones in the development of the hvas include the following completion of enrollment in our advance trial  fda approval of a cap for the advance trial allowing for the continued enrollment of patients  submission of pma application for bridge to transplant indication  ide approval of our endurance trial for destination therapy indication  and being named to the revive it study  a study to be completed by the universities of michigan and pittsburgh on the benefits of lvad s in patients with earlier access to the device 
beyond the heartware system  we are also evaluating our next generation device  the mvad 
the mvad is based on the same technology platform as the heartware system but adopts an axial flow  rather than a centrifugal flow configuration  and is being developed in multiple configurations 
the mvad designs are currently at the preclinical stage and undergoing animal studies focused on minimally invasive implantation techniques 
each of the mvad configurations is approximately one third the size of the hvad pump 
we believe that the mvad designs will be implantable by surgical techniques that are even less invasive than those required to implant the hvad pump 
we began generating revenue from our product sales in august and have incurred net losses in each year since our inception 
we expect our losses to continue as we advance and expand our clinical trial activities in the us  continue to develop commercial markets outside of the us and expand our research and development into next generation products including the mvad 
we have financed our operations primarily through the issuance of convertible notes and the issuance of shares of our common stock 
most recently  on december   the company issued convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of million pursuant to the terms of an indenture dated as of december  the convertible senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company 
the convertible senior notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually in arrears on june and december of each year  beginning on june  the convertible senior notes will mature on december   unless earlier repurchased or converted 
in february  we closed a public offering  under a shelf registration on form s filed with the securities and exchange commission on december   of approximately million shares of our common stock at an offering price of per share for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million 
this amount includes the underwriter s exercise of their over allotment option to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock at the offering price 
in august  we sold approximately million shares of our common stock through private placements in the united states and australia  which raised net proceeds of approximately million 

table of contents we are headquartered in framingham  massachusetts 
we have an operations and manufacturing facility in miami lakes  florida  a small development and operations facility in sydney  australia and a small distribution and customer service facility in hannover  germany 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we are required to make estimates and judgments in preparing the financial statements that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we base our estimates on our historical experience to the extent practicable and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made 
if our assumptions prove inaccurate or if our future results are not consistent with our historical experience  we may be required to make adjustments in our policies that affect our reported results 
our most critical accounting policies and estimates include revenue recognition  inventory capitalization  accounting for share based compensation  measurement of fair value  income taxes and reserves 
we also have other key accounting policies that are less subjective and  therefore  their application would not have a material impact on our reported results of operations 
the following is a discussion of our most critical policies  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales in accordance with fasb asc revenue recognition 
pursuant to agreements or orders from customers  we ship product to our customers 
revenue from product sales is only recognized when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to our customers  the selling price is fixed and collection is reasonably assured 
a majority of product sales are made on a consignment basis and as such  pursuant to the terms of the consignment arrangements  revenue is recognized on the date the consigned product is implanted or otherwise consumed 
revenue from product sales not sold on a consignment basis is recognized upon customer receipt and acceptance of the product 
revenue recognized to date is from sales of our devices in connection with our us clinical trial and commercial sales in europe and to a lesser extent under special access in other countries 
inventory capitalization we expense costs relating to the production of inventories as research and development r d expense in the period incurred until such time as we believe future commercialization is considered probable and future economic benefit is expected to be recognized  which generally is reliant upon receipt of regulatory approval 
we then begin to capitalize subsequent inventory costs relating to that product 
we received a full investigational device exemption in september from the fda for the heartware system and subsequently began selling our product through our us clinical trial 
therefore  effective september   we adopted a policy for capitalizing inventory and recognizing cost of sales related to the heartware system 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on a first in  first out fifo method 
we utilize a standard costing system  which requires significant management judgment and estimates in determining and applying labor and overhead rates 
labor and overhead rates are estimated based on our best estimate of annual production volumes and labor rates and hours per manufacturing process 
these estimates are based on historical experience and budgeted expenses and production volume 
estimates are set at the beginning of the year and updated periodically 
while we believe our standard costs are reliable  actual production costs and volume changes may impact inventory  costs of sales and the absorption of production overhead expenses 

table of contents we review our inventory for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
we include in inventory materials and finished goods that are held for sale 
certain materials and finished goods held in inventory may be used in research and development activities and are expensed as part of research and development costs when consumed 
share based compensation we recognize share based compensation expense in connection with our share based awards  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  and therefore only recognize compensation cost for those awards expected to vest over the service period of the award 
we value restricted stock units rsu s at their intrinsic value on the date of grant 
we use a black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options 
calculating share based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective judgment and assumptions  including estimates of expected life of the award  stock price volatility  forfeiture rates and risk free interest rates 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
when appropriate  we estimate the expected life of an option by averaging the contractual term of the stock option grants up to years with the associated vesting term typically years 
we estimate the volatility of our shares on the date of grant considering several factors  including the historical volatility of our publicly traded shares 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on our historical experience of forfeitures and our employee retention rate 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
we estimate the risk free interest rate based on rates in effect for united states government bonds with terms similar to the expected lives of the awards  at the time of grant 
we have issued share based awards with performance based vesting criteria 
achievement of the milestones must be probable before we begin recording share based compensation expense 
at each reporting period  we review the likelihood that these awards will vest and if the vesting is deemed probable  we begin to recognize compensation expense at that time 
in the period that achievement of the performance based criteria is deemed probable  us gaap requires the immediate recognition of all previously unrecognized compensation since the original grant date 
as a result  compensation expense recorded in the period that achievement is deemed probable could include a substantial amount of previously unrecorded compensation expense related to the prior periods 
during and  we determined that achievement of certain performance based vesting criteria for awards originally granted in and was probable 
therefore  we began recording compensation expense during and in connection with certain share based awards that had been outstanding but for which we had not previously recorded any compensation expense 
if ultimately performance goals are not met  for any awards where vesting was previously deemed probable  previously recognized compensation cost will be reversed 
fair value measurements fasb asc fair value measurements and disclosures defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
fasb asc requires disclosures about the fair value of all financial instruments  whether or not recognized  for financial statement purposes 
disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments are based on pertinent information available to us as of the respective reporting dates 
accordingly  the estimates presented in our financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized on disposition of the financial instruments 
fasb asc specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable 
observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources  while unobservable inputs reflect the company s market assumptions 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurement and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurement 

table of contents the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date 
level primarily consists of financial instruments whose value is based on quoted market prices such as exchange traded instruments and listed equities 
level inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
level includes financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies 
these models consider various assumptions  including volatility factors  current market prices and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments 
substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace  can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace 
level unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
financial instruments are considered level when their fair values are determined using pricing models  discounted cash flows or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable 
calculating fair value utilizing level and level inputs requires the input of highly subjective judgment and assumptions 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of financial instruments represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  the use of different estimates or assumptions would result in a higher or lower fair value and different amounts being recorded in our financial statements 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the liability method presented by fasb asc income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws 
deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the assets or liabilities from year to year 
in providing for deferred taxes  we consider tax regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate  estimates of future taxable income  and available tax planning strategies 
if tax regulations  operating results or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary  adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required 
valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on the more likely than not criteria of fasb asc through december   we have historically concluded that a full valuation allowance is required to offset our net deferred tax assets 
fasb asc requires that we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
reserves management must make estimates and judgments to determine the amount of reserves to record in the financial statements 
if any of these decisions proves incorrect  our consolidated financial statements could be materially and adversely affected 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from an inability to collect payments owed to us for product sales 
we regularly review the allowance by considering factors such as historical experience  the age of the accounts receivable balances and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
certain patient accessories sold with the heartware system are covered by a limited warranty ranging from one to two years 
estimated contractual warranty obligations are recorded as an expense when the related revenue is recognized and are included in cost of revenues on our consolidated statements of operations 
factors that affect estimated warranty liability include the number of units sold  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims  cost per claim  and vendor supported warranty programs 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary 

table of contents results of operations the following is a description of significant components of our operations  including significant trends and challenges that we believe are important to an understanding of our business and results of operations 
fiscal years and revenue  net years ended december  change in thousands revenue  net for the year ended december   we generated revenue from commercial sales outside of the us and sales in connection with our us clinical trials 
the increase in revenue is primarily due to increased market penetration outside of the us and increased activity in our us bridge to transplant study including sales after completion of the study through a continued access protocol cap 
approximately of our product sales in were derived outside of the us as compared to in the prior year 
the increase in the portion of our revenues derived from outside of the united states is due to the continued commercial rollout of the heartware system in europe and other countries with additional implants at existing sites and the addition of new sites 
we expect to continue to generate and grow commercial revenue from product sales as we further expand our sales and marketing efforts outside of the united states  continue implanting under cap for a bridge to transplant indication  and increase the number of implants in our destination therapy clinical trial  endurance  in the us notwithstanding our plans to generally expand our us clinical programs  revenues from us sources in connection with our trials may vary from quarter to quarter as the number of implants under cap is subject to fda approval for each cohort of patients 
future product sales are dependent on many factors  including receiving and maintaining the necessary regulatory approvals in the united states and internationally  market acceptance among physicians  patients  health care payers and the medical community as well as our capacity to meet customer demand by manufacturing sufficient quantities of our products 
cost of revenues cost of revenues totaled approximately million for the year ended december  and approximately million for the year ended december  gross profit and gross margin percentage are as follows years ended december  gross profit in thousands gross margin the increase in gross margin is primarily due to the increase in unit production reducing the overhead and labor costs applied on a per unit basis 

table of contents selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses include costs associated with selling and marketing our products and the general corporate administration of the company 
these costs are primarily related to salaries and wages and related employee costs  depreciation of fixed assets  travel  external consultants and contractors  legal and accounting fees and general infrastructure costs and include all operating costs not associated with or otherwise classified as research and development costs or cost of revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses were as follows years ended december  change in thousands total selling  general and administrative expenses of operating expenses during  we experienced significant growth as we expanded european sales and distribution capabilities and increased the number of implants in the us under clinical trials 
we also experienced growth in administrative costs as we continued to manage dual listings of our securities in the united states and australia  raised additional capital and expanded our administrative capabilities to support overall corporate growth 
as a result  we experienced expansion of our staff  including in senior management  and overall growth in selling and marketing and administrative functions and experienced a related expansion in infrastructure costs 
the increase of million in selling  general and administrative costs are primarily a result of an increase in share based payment expense of million  an increase in employee costs  including salaries and wages and related costs  of million  and an increase in travel of million 
in addition  we experienced increases in costs of  related to accounting and tax matters  consultants and contractors of  office expenses of  marketing expenses of  and bad debt expense related to the establishment of a reserve for doubtful accounts of  increases in costs were partially offset by a decrease in legal fees in as compared to of approximately million associated with a failed merger transaction in the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of operating expenses is due to r d expenses comprising a higher percentage of overall costs as discussed below 
research and development research and development expenses are the direct and indirect costs associated with developing our products prior to commercialization and are expensed as incurred 
these expenses fluctuate based on project level activity and availability of funding to support new and ongoing projects and consist primarily of salaries and wages and related employee costs of our research and development and clinical and regulatory staff  external research and development costs  materials and expenses associated with clinical trials 
additional costs include travel  facilities and overhead allocations 
research and development expenses were as follows years ended december  change in thousands total research and development expenses of operating expenses as discussed above  we experienced significant growth in we achieved significant research and development milestones including enrolling a substantial number of patients in our us clinical trial  developing three design configurations for the mvad and furthering animal studies for less invasive implantable techniques related to the mvad 
the increase in research and development expenses  in total and as a percentage of total operating expenses  was primarily a result of increased clinical trial activity  continued development of next generation products  and costs associated with preparing the pma application submission to the fda 

table of contents the increase in research and development expenses of approximately million is primarily due to an increase in costs associated with our us clinical trials of million  an increase in costs associated with development projects including outside engineering  consultants and contractors of million related to mvad development and preparation for our pma application for hvad and an increase in headcount and related employee costs  including salaries and wages and related costs  of approximately million 
even with commercial approval of the heartware system in europe  we expect that research and development expenses will continue to represent a significant portion of our operating expenses for the foreseeable future related to clinical trials in the us and new product development  including costs related to the development of the mvad 
foreign exchange foreign exchange losses totaled approximately  in the year ended december   as compared to a loss of approximately  for the prior year 
in  the majority of our realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses were experienced upon the collection of certain accounts receivable that were denominated in foreign currencies  and the translation to us dollars of customer accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies at period end  primarily the euro 
we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future as the majority of our sales denominated in foreign currencies are settled in euros 
in  the majority of our foreign exchange gains and losses were due to remeasurement of our cash holdings denominated in us dollars held by our australian subsidiary as a result of movements in the exchange rate between the australian dollar and the us dollar 
during the first half of  we maintained the majority of our cash and cash equivalents in australia  denominated in both australian and us dollars 
however  beginning in the second half of  the majority of our cash and cash equivalents are in us dollars on deposit with banks located in the united states 
interest expense interest expense was approximately  for the year ended december   which consists of accrued interest incurred on the principal amount of the convertible senior notes of approximately  and non cash amortization of the related discount and deferred financing costs totaling approximately  interest expense was approximately  for the year ended december   which consists of interest incurred on the principal amount of the convertible loans from thoratec of approximately  and non cash amortization of the deferred financing costs of approximately  interest on the convertible senior notes is payable at a rate of per annum 
interest expense also includes amortization of the discount on the convertible senior notes and amortization of the deferred financing costs associated with the convertible senior notes 
we expect interest expense to significantly increase in due to the issuance of these convertible senior notes 
interest expense in consists of interest incurred on the principal amount of the convertible loans from thoratec that were drawn down in august and december and amortization of deferred non cash financing costs related to the thoratec loan agreement 
interest on the convertible loans was payable at a rate of per annum 
the deferred financing costs were being amortized over the term of the thoratec loan agreement  which was set to expire no later than november  however  with the repayment of all amounts available to be borrowed under the terms of the agreement  we effectively extinguished all debt under this agreement 
there was no such interest expense in as the convertible loans were repaid and the loan agreement terminated in the fourth quarter of interest income  net interest income is primarily derived from investments and cash and short term deposit accounts held in the us the amortization of premium on our investments is also included in interest income  net 
interest income  net was approximately  for the year ended december  as compared to approximately  for the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to higher cash balances during the period resulting from the capital raises completed in the second half of and in february however  we experienced lower interest rates in compared to 
table of contents change in fair value of derivative instrument as further discussed in note to the accompanying financial statements  we recorded the fair value of a derivative instrument on july  related to the australian dollar denominated conversion feature in the thoratec loan agreement 
we were required to initially record this derivative at fair value on july  and re measure fair value at each reporting period 
during the year ended december  we recognized aggregate non cash expenses of approximately million due to the increase in the fair value of this derivative between july  and december   the date the derivative was extinguished 
this increase in fair value was primarily due to an increase in the fair value of our common stock and is non cash in nature 
gain on early extinguishment of debt as further discussed in note to the accompanying financial statements  in  we recorded a net gain non cash on the early extinguishment of debt related to the thoratec loan agreement 
due to the repayment of all amounts borrowed under the loan agreement  our inability to re borrow amounts repaid and thoratec s inability to convert any repaid amounts into our common stock  the fair value of the derivative instrument at the repayment dates  aggregating approximately million  was recorded as a gain on the extinguishment of debt 
further  the unamortized balance of the deferred financing costs at the repayment dates  aggregating approximately million  was recorded as a reduction of the gain on early extinguishment of debt  resulting in a net gain on the early extinguishment of debt of million for the year ended december  since there are no funds held in escrow  there are no amounts remaining for us to borrow and no amounts remaining for thoratec to convert into shares of heartware common stock 
therefore  thoratec s conversion rights  and thus the derivative  have been eliminated 
income taxes we are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions 
we have incurred losses since inception 
changes in share ownership  as well as other factors  may limit our ability to utilize any net operating loss carry forwards  and as such a valuation allowance has been recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
as of december   we did not have revenues or profit which would be sufficient to allow any portion of our deferred tax assets to be recorded 
we intend to monitor closely the question of whether to record a deferred tax asset as we expand the commercialization of our products 
fiscal years and revenue  net for the year ended december   we generated net revenue from product sales of approximately million as compared to  in the year ended december  for the year ended december   we generated revenue from sales in connection with our us clinical trial and commercial sales outside of the us for the year ended  december   revenue consisted of a limited number of unit sales following commencement of our us bridge to transplant clinical trial in august with no revenue being derived during that period from sources outside the us as of december   we had enrolled of the patients we intend to enroll in the us trial 
in january  we received ce marking approval for our heartware system and began generating commercial revenue in europe 
approximately of our product sales in were derived internationally 
we expect to continue to generate and grow commercial revenue from product sales as we further expand our sales and marketing efforts outside of the united states 
notwithstanding our plans to generally expand our us clinical programs  revenues from us sources in connection with our bridge to transplant trial may wane  after the first half of as we complete enrollment of this trial and we await approvals from the fda to commence a destination therapy clinical trial and to continue implanting additional bridge to transplant patients under a continued access program  or cap  protocol in any us center that implanted a patient in the bridge to transplant trial 
future product sales are dependent on many factors  including receiving and maintaining the necessary regulatory approvals in the united states and internationally  market acceptance among physicians  patients  health care payers and the medical community as well as our capacity to meet customer demand by manufacturing sufficient quantities of our products 

table of contents cost of revenues cost of revenues totaled approximately million for the year ended december  and approximately  for the year ended december  gross profit and gross margin percentage are as follows years ended december  gross profit in thousands gross margin we began capitalizing inventory on september  prior to that time  product costs were expensed as r d costs see critical accounting policies and estimates inventories 
at september   we had product on hand that was previously expensed as r d costs but was subsequently utilized in the production and sale of finished goods 
from september through the first half of  the carrying value of our inventories and our cost of revenues were reduced by the value of product on hand that had been previously expensed as r d 
therefore  cost of revenues for the last four months of and the first half of did not include the cost of this existing or pre launch inventory and this resulted in a higher than expected gross margin until all pre launch inventory was consumed 
in addition  as we have limited manufacturing experience and we use a standard costing method for determining costs of inventory based on limited historical data  our actual results may differ from standards 
as a result  gross margins have been and may continue to be inconsistent from quarter to quarter 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses include costs associated with selling and marketing our products and the general corporate administration of the company 
these costs are primarily related to salaries and wages and related employee costs  depreciation of fixed assets  travel  external consultants and contractors  legal and accounting fees and general infrastructure costs and include all operating costs not associated with or otherwise classified as research and development costs or cost of revenues 
during  we experienced significant growth as we established european sales and distribution capabilities and sold commercially throughout europe and under special access in other countries 
we also experienced growth in the us as we initiated wider enrollment in our first human clinical trial in the united states  continued to manage dual listings of our securities in the united states and australia  raised additional capital and expanded our research and development and manufacturing activities 
as a result  we experienced expansion of our staff  including senior management  and a related expansion in infrastructure costs 
also  in  we entered into a merger agreement with thoratec corporation that ultimately was not consummated due to intervention from the us government on anti competitive grounds 
this unsuccessful merger did however result in the expenditure of substantial legal and other professional expenses 
in  selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million  or  of operating expenses  as compared to million  or of operating expenses in the increase was primarily a result of million of legal and other expenses related to the proposed merger with thoratec corporation and increased share based compensation of approximately  the increase in share based compensation was due to the issuance of additional awards and the recognition in of expense related to awards previously granted in and with performance criteria that were not previously deemed probable 
upon being deemed probable in  compensation expense was recognized from the initial grant date through the date the achievement of the performance criteria were deemed probable see note of the accompanying financial statements 

table of contents research and development research and development expenses are the direct and indirect costs associated with developing our products prior to commercialization and are expensed as incurred 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and wages and related employee costs of our research and development and clinical and regulatory staff external research and development costs  materials and expenses associated with clinical trials 
additional costs include travel  facilities and overhead allocations 
even with commercial approval of the heartware system in europe  we expect that research and development expenses will continue to represent a significant portion of our operating expenses for the foreseeable future related to clinical trials in the us and new product development  including costs related to the development of the mvad 
as discussed above  we experienced significant growth in we achieved significant research and development milestones including enrolling a substantial number of patients in our us clinical trial  developing three design configurations for the mvad and furthering animal studies for less invasive implantable techniques related to the mvad 
in  research and development expenses were million  or  of operating expenses as compared to million  or of operating expenses  in the decrease was primarily a result of recognizing the labor  material and overhead costs of manufacturing the heartware system as part of inventory  and upon sale  as costs of revenue  in subsequent to the recognition of revenue and the capitalization of inventory see critical accounting policies and estimates inventories 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in headcount and related employee costs in our research and development and clinical and regulatory groups as well as increased clinical trial costs  professional fees and other research and development expenses related to existing research projects and on going clinical trials and regulatory activities 
foreign exchange foreign exchange losses totaled approximately  in the year ended december   as compared to a gain of approximately million for the prior year 
the difference was due to fluctuations in the overall balance  proportion and value of our cash holdings denominated in us dollars held by our australian subsidiary as a result of movements in the exchange rate between the australian dollar and the us dollar 
historically  we maintained the majority of our cash and cash equivalents in australia  denominated in both australian and us dollars throughout  and as of december   the majority of our cash and cash equivalents were in us dollars on deposit with banks located in the united states 
therefore  we expect that the amount of foreign exchange gains and losses on cash holdings held by our australian subsidiary will not be as significant as historical amounts 
interest expense interest expense in consists of interest incurred on the principal amount of the convertible loans from thoratec that were drawn down in august and december and amortization of deferred non cash financing costs related to the thoratec loan agreement 
interest on the convertible loans was payable at a rate of per annum 
the deferred financing costs were being amortized over the term of the thoratec loan agreement  which was set to expire no later than november  however  with the repayment of all amounts available to be borrowed under the terms of the agreement  we effectively extinguished all debt under this agreement 
we will not incur any further amortization costs related to this agreement 
interest expense was approximately  for the year ended december  interest incurred on the principal amount of the convertible loans was approximately  and non cash amortization of the deferred financing costs totaled approximately  
table of contents interest income  net interest income is primarily derived from cash and short term deposit accounts  denominated in both australian and us dollars  held in australia and the us interest income was approximately  for the year ended december  as compared to approximately million for the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates earned and lower average daily cash balances during the period 
change in fair value of derivative instrument as further discussed in note to the accompanying financial statements  we recorded the fair value of a derivative instrument on july  related to the australian dollar denominated conversion feature in the thoratec loan agreement 
we were required to initially record this derivative at fair value on july  and re measure fair value at each reporting period 
during the year ended december  we recognized aggregate non cash expenses of approximately million due to the increase in the fair value of this derivative between july  and december   the date the derivative was extinguished 
this increase in fair value was primarily due to an increase in the fair value of our common stock and is non cash in nature 
gain on early extinguishment of debt as further discussed in note to the accompanying financial statements  in  we recorded a net gain non cash on the early extinguishment of debt related to the thoratec loan agreement 
due to the repayment of all amounts borrowed under the loan agreement  our inability to re borrow amounts repaid and thoratec s inability to convert any repaid amounts into our common stock  the fair value of the derivative instrument at the repayment dates  aggregating approximately million  was recorded as a gain on the extinguishment of debt 
further  the unamortized balance of the deferred financing costs at the repayment dates  aggregating approximately million  was recorded as a reduction of the gain on early extinguishment of debt  resulting in a net gain on the early extinguishment of debt of million for the year ended december  since there are no funds held in escrow  there are no amounts remaining for us to borrow and no amounts remaining for thoratec to convert into shares of heartware common stock 
therefore  thoratec s conversion rights  and thus the derivative  have been eliminated 
other  net other  net consists of gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets 
for the year ended december   we incurred a loss on the disposal of fixed assets of approximately  primarily in connection with the termination of our lease for administrative offices in australia 
for the year ended december   we incurred a loss on the disposal of fixed assets of approximately  primarily in connection with the termination of our lease for our prior manufacturing facility in florida 
income taxes we are subject to taxation in the united states and australia 
we have incurred losses since inception in both jurisdictions 
changes in share ownership  as well as other factors  may limit our ability to utilize any net operating loss carry forwards  and as such a valuation allowance has been recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
as of december   we did not have revenues or profit which would be sufficient to allow any portion of our deferred tax assets to be recorded 
we intend to monitor closely the question of whether to record a deferred tax asset as we expand the commercialization of our products 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our cash and cash equivalents were approximately million as compared to million at december  the increase is primarily a result of the cash proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes in december  the issuance of common stock in february and the exercise of stock options  partially offset by cash used to support our operating and investing activities 

table of contents following is a summary of our cash flow activities years ended december  in thousands net cash used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase in cash and cash equivalents cash used in operating activities cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was approximately million as compared to approximately million for the same period in the prior year 
for  this amount included a net loss of approximately million and non cash adjustments to net loss in a total amount of approximately million  which primarily consisted of million of share based compensation  and million of depreciation and amortization 
also included in cash used in operating activities in is approximately million related to an increase in accounts receivable and million for the purchase and manufacture of inventories offset by cash provided by the increase of accrued expenses and other current liabilities of approximately million

operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we have incurred operating losses to date and anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial net losses as we expand our sales and marketing capabilities  develop new products and seek regulatory approvals for the heartware system in the us in  cash on hand is expected to primarily be used to fund our ongoing operations  including expanding our sales and marketing capabilities on a global basis  continuing implants under a cap  and enrolling patients in our us destination therapy clinical study  continued product development  regulatory and other compliance functions as well as for general working capital 
we expect to experience increased cash requirements for inventory and property related to the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities to support continued growth 
we believe cash on hand and investment balances as of december  is sufficient to support our planned operations throughout and because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of medical devices and the current economic situation  we are unable to estimate the exact amounts of capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to obtain regulatory approvals in the us  fund commercial expansion outside of the us and develop new products 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the following commercial acceptance of our products  costs to manufacture our products  expenses required to operate multiple clinical trials  further product research and development for next generation products and peripherals and efforts to sustain and maintain incremental improvements to existing products  expanding our sales and marketing capabilities on a global basis  including building a team to support us commercialization should the fda approve our device for marketing in the us  broadening our infrastructure in order to meet the needs of our growing operations  and complying with the requirements related to being a public company in both the united states and australia

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of market risk sensitive instruments caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk is currently confined to interest earnings on our cash and cash equivalents that are invested in highly liquid money market funds 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
we do not presently use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
our convertible notes do not bear interest rate risk as the notes were issued with a fixed interest rate of per annum 
foreign currency rate fluctuations we conduct business in foreign countries 
for us reporting purposes  we translate all assets and liabilities of our non us entities at the period end exchange rate and revenues and expenses at the average exchange rates in effect during the periods 
the net effect of these translation adjustments is shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as a component of stockholders equity 
we generate a substantial portion of our revenues and collect receivables in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the euro  british pound and australian dollar can result in foreign currency exchange gains and losses that may significantly impact our financial results and our overall cash position 
these foreign currency transaction gains and losses are presented as a separate line item on our consolidated statements of operations 
continued fluctuation of these exchange rates could result in financial results that are not comparable from quarter to quarter 
we do not currently utilize foreign currency contracts to mitigate the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of non functional currency assets and liabilities but do hold cash reserves in currencies in which those reserves are anticipated to be expended
