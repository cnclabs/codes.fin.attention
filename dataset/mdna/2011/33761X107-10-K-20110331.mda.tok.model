table of contents management outlook our revenues consist primarily of income from our portfolio assets  loan investments and acquisition partnerships  servicing fee income and incentive income based on the performance of the portfolio assets that we manage  and income generated by our debt and equity investments consolidated and unconsolidated in privately held middle market companies 
our ability to maintain and grow revenues depends on our ability to secure investment opportunities  obtain financing for transactions  and to consummate investments and deliver attractive risk adjusted returns 
our ability to execute this strategy depends upon a number of market conditions including the strength and liquidity of us and global economies and financial markets 
while we are seeing signs of improvement and stabilization in us and global economic conditions and financial markets  these conditions and markets remain challenging and their recovery has been imbalanced 
despite substantial losses reported in the financial services sector in recent years  and continued volatility and uncertainty in us and global economies and financial markets  management remains positive on the outlook of the company and believes that current market conditions should not hinder firstcity ability to expand its business 
while disruptions and uncertainty in the markets may adversely affect our existing positions  we believe such conditions generally present significant new investment opportunities for distressed asset acquisition and special situations transactions 
currently  however  we believe that challenging market conditions and government implemented programs and regulations have reduced transaction flow in the marketplace  and that distressed asset prices have yet to fall to levels commensurate with expectations of market participants 
due to the difficulty and challenges related to servicing and resolving these underperforming and non performing assets  we believe that financial institutions and other entities will actively seek to shed these assets over time as economic conditions and financial markets stabilize and government imposed restrictions lapse 
sales of such assets improve the sellers financial position ie asset quality and capital positions  reduce overhead costs and staffing requirements  and reduce management and personnel distractions associated with the intensive and time consuming task of resolving loans and disposing of real estate 
market commentators and analysts have expressed the belief that it will take some time for the us and global economies and financial markets to fully recover  but it is not clear if adverse conditions will again intensify 
as a result  the continued challenging economic conditions could still materially and adversely impact i our ability to price and fund new distressed asset and middle market capital investment opportunities on attractive terms  ii the ability of our borrowers to repay or refinance their debt obligations to us  iii the value of the underlying real estate properties and other assets securing our purchased and originated loan investments  and or iv the financial condition  operations and liquidity of the underlying servicing and operating entities in which we have an equity investment 
there can be no assurance that the value of our portfolio assets  loan investments and other investment assets  or the performance of our equity method investees and consolidated subsidiaries  will not be negatively impacted by challenging economic conditions which could have a negative impact on our future results 
in addition to various other debt and equity investment opportunities  we continue to seek distressed asset investment opportunities under our investment agreement with v rde see note of the company consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the company involvement in these investments will come in the form of minority ownership ranging from to at firstcity determination of an acquisition entity formed by firstcity and v rde 
firstcity will also be the servicer for the acquisition entities formed with v rde 
firstcity increased holdings in the minority owned  unconsolidated acquisition entities under this investment agreement represent a shift in the company portfolio asset acquisition history over the past years which primarily consisted of consolidated portfolio assets 
as such  in the context of the company portfolio asset acquisition and resolution business segment  management expects to see a gradual shift in the composition of firstcity income attributed to distressed asset investments to equity in earnings of unconsolidated 
table of contents subsidiaries unconsolidated equity method investments from income from portfolio assets consolidated portfolio assets 
management also expects to see a gradual increase in service fee income over time related to the performance of our servicing responsibilities related to these unconsolidated acquisition entities 
refer to the heading results of operations below for additional information related to our portfolio asset acquisition and resolution operations 
our ability to make new investments is dependent on the cash leak through and overhead allowance provisions included in our term loan facility with bank of scotland see note of the company consolidated financial statements for additional information  residual cash flows from the pledged assets and equity investments after full repayment of the bank of scotland debt  our current holdings of unencumbered cash and portfolio assets  and our investment agreement in place with v rde see note of the company consolidated financial statements for additional information 
while management believes that these cash flow sources will provide firstcity with funding and liquidity to support its operations and investment activities  firstcity continues to actively seek additional sources of liquidity and alternative funding sources 
results of operations the following discussion and analysis is based on the segment reporting information presented in note to the company consolidated financial statements  and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
as a result of significant period to period fluctuations in our revenues and earnings  period to period comparisons of the results of our operations may not be meaningful 
the company financial results are impacted by many factors including  but not limited to  general economic conditions  fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  fluctuations in the underlying values of real estate and other assets  the timing and ability to collect and liquidate assets  increased competition from other market players in the industries in which we operate  and the availability  pricing and terms for portfolio assets  middle market transactions and other investments in all of the company businesses 
the company business and results of operations are also impacted by the availability of liquidity to fund our investment activity and operations  and our access to capital markets 
such factors  individually or combined with other factors  may result in significant fluctuations in our reported operations and in the trading price of our common stock

generally speaking  income recognized from our investments in consolidated portfolio assets is reported as income from portfolio assets on 
table of contents our consolidated statements of operations  whereas income from our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries that acquire portfolio assets is reported as equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries 
furthermore  since we function as the servicer for the vast majority of our domestic and latin american unconsolidated portfolio assets  we also recognize fee income related to the performance of our servicing responsibilities 
this fee income is reported as servicing fees on our consolidated statements of operations

table of contents servicing fee revenues 
servicing fee revenues decreased to million in from million in servicing fees from domestic acquisition partnerships totaled million in compared to million in  while servicing fees from latin american acquisition partnerships totaled million in and million in servicing fees from domestic acquisition partnerships are generally based on a percentage of the collections received from portfolio assets held by these unconsolidated partnerships  whereas servicing fees from latin american acquisition partnerships are generally based on the cost of servicing plus a profit margin 
the increase in servicing fees from domestic acquisition partnerships was due primarily to the impact of an increase in collections from unconsolidated domestic partnerships to million for from million for  off set partially by million of additional performance based servicing fees recognized in compared to the decline in servicing fees from the latin american acquisition partnerships was attributable to a decrease in the servicing costs related to those unconsolidated partnerships in compared to ie the lower the servicing costs incurred by these partnerships  the lower the service fee income recognized by the company 
income from portfolio assets 
income from portfolio assets decreased to million in compared to million in the net decrease in income from portfolio assets was attributed primarily to a shift in the income recognition methods used by management for certain of the company existing and newly acquired portfolio assets to non accrual income methods cost recovery or cash basis from the interest accrual income method over the past months 
we apply non accrual income recognition methods to portfolio assets  as applicable  due to uncertainties related to estimating the timing and or amount of collections as a result of the current economic environment 
as such  income accretion from portfolio assets decreased by million in compared to this income decrease was off set partially by million of additional portfolio asset liquidation income and gains recognized in compared to collections from consolidated portfolio assets decreased to million in from million in including a million decrease in domestic portfolio asset collections 
however  firstcity was able to recognize significantly higher margins on its consolidated european portfolio asset liquidations in compared to  due primarily to million of additional collections from these portfolio assets in compared to refer to note of the company consolidated financial statements for a summary of our income recognition accounting policies related to portfolio assets  and note of the consolidated financial statements for a summary of income from portfolio assets 
gain on sale of sba loans held for sale 
the company recorded million of gains on the sales of sba loans in with a million net basis in the loans sold  compared to million of gains recorded in with a million net basis in the loans sold 
gains on sba loan sales reflect the company participation in the sba guaranteed loan program 
under the sba a program  the sba guarantees up to percent of the principal on a qualifying loan 
the company generally sells the guaranteed portions of originated loans into the secondary market and retains the unguaranteed portion for investment 
at december   the company had approximately million of deferred gains on sba loans sales with a million net basis that were accounted for as secured borrowings on such date pursuant to the company adoption  effective january   of the fasb guidance on accounting for transfers of financial assets refer to note of the company consolidated financial statements 
the company did not have any deferred gains on sba loan sales at december  gain on sale of investment securities 
in  the company recognized a million gain related to the sale of its investment security that represented a beneficial interest in securitized financial assets 
no such sales were recorded in 
table of contents interest income from sba loans 
interest income from sba loans remained relatively constant at million in compared to million in firstcity average investment level in sba loans held for investment approximated million for compared to million for interest income from loans receivable affiliates 
interest income from loans receivable affiliates decreased to million for compared to million for the interest income decline is attributed primarily to a decline in firstcity average investment level in loans receivable affiliates in its paa r segment to million for compared to million for interest income from loans receivable other 
interest income from loans receivable other decreased by million for compared to the company did not recognize interest income from loans receivable other in from its non affiliated loan investments because management accounted for such loans under the non accrual method of accounting during the entire period 
firstcity average investment in loans receivable other in its paa r segment was million in accounted for under the non accrual method  compared to its average investment in such loans of million in included million accounted for under the non accrual method 
other income 
other income for increased by million in comparison to primarily due to million of due diligence fee income recognized by firstcity in under its investment agreement with v rde effective april see note of the company consolidated financial statements for additional information and million of additional other due diligence income recorded in compared to attributable to increased bidding and investment activity in compared to  off set partially by a million decrease in interest income in compared to as a result of the company selling its beneficial interest in securitized financial assets in costs and expenses 
operating costs and expenses approximated million in compared to million in the following is a discussion of the major components of the company operating costs and expenses in its paa r business segment interest expense and fees on notes payable totaled million for and million for firstcity average outstanding debt in its paa r segment increased to million in from million in primarily to finance its increased investment activity and to provide working capital to support future growth 
the company average cost of borrowings increased to in compared to in  primarily due to the higher interest and fees charged on our reducing note facility with bank of scotland closed in june compared to the interest rates and fees under the loan facilities we had in place with bank of scotland last year 
salaries and benefits increased to million in from million in  due primarily to increased costs related to base salaries  payroll taxes  employee benefits and bonuses in the paa r segment in compared to the total number of personnel within the paa r segment was and at december  and  respectively 
net provisions for loan and impairment losses on our consolidated portfolio assets and loans receivable in our paa r segment totaled million in and million in the million of net impairment provisions in were attributed primarily to declines in values of real estate properties and loan collateral related to our domestic portfolio assets and loans 
the impairment provisions were identified in connection with management quarterly evaluation of the collectibility of the company portfolio assets and loans receivable 
the process for evaluating and measuring impairment is critical to our financial results  as it requires subjective and complex judgments due to the need to make estimates about the impact of matters that are uncertain 
this process also requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
it remains unclear what impact the continuance of challenging economic conditions and disruptions in the financial  capital and real estate markets will ultimately have on our financial results 
these conditions could adversely impact our business if commercial real estate properties experience a 
table of contents significant and prolonged decline in value or if borrowers cannot refinance their loans and or continue to make payments which in turn could lead to rising loan defaults and foreclosures on loan collateral 
therefore  we cannot provide assurance that  in any particular future period  we will not incur additional impairment provisions 
asset level expenses  which generally represent costs incurred by firstcity to manage consolidated portfolio assets in its paa r business segment  support foreclosed properties and to protect its security interests in loan collateral  increased to million in from million in the increased level of expenses is attributed primarily to the company increased holdings in foreclosed real estate properties  which totaled million at december  compared to million a year ago  and an increase in the company average investment level in consolidated portfolio assets to million for from million for other costs and expenses in the company paa r segment increased to million for from million for  primarily due to million of additional foreign currency exchange losses attributed to our consolidated foreign operations in compared to attributed to our consolidated european and latin american operations 
equity in losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries 
equity in losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries acquisition partnership and servicing entities from our paa r segment increased by million in compared to equity in losses of our unconsolidated acquisition partnerships totaled million in compared to million in  whereas equity in earnings of our unconsolidated servicing entities increased to million of earnings in compared to million of losses in our share of equity in earnings and losses from these equity method investees will vary period to period depending on the profitability of the underlying entities and the composition of firstcity ownership mix in the respective entities that report earnings or losses in a period 
the following is a discussion of equity in earnings from firstcity acquisition partnerships by geographic region and servicing entities 
refer to note of the company consolidated financial statements for a summary of revenues  earnings and equity in earnings loss of firstcity equity investments by region 
domestic total combined revenues reported by our us acquisition partnerships firstcity share increased to million in compared to million in in addition  total combined net earnings reported by domestic partnerships increased to million in compared to million in the increase in total revenues and net earnings in compared to was attributable primarily to an increase in collections to million in from million in  which was off set partially by the following a million increase in net impairment provisions recorded by these partnerships in compared to  including million of additional impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of q compared to the fourth quarter of q  a million increase in service fee expense  and a million decline in interest and accretion income in compared to due primarily to an increase in the level of domestic partnership loan portfolios accounted for on a non accrual method of accounting cost recovery or cash basis instead of the interest method ie accrual method 
under us gaap  the interest method of accounting for income recognition purposes is not appropriate if management does not have the ability to develop a reasonable expectation of both the timing and amount of future cash flows to be collected 
although total revenues and net earnings reported by our domestic acquisition partnerships increased in compared to  the collective activity described above translated to a decrease in firstcity share of domestic partnership net earnings to a million loss for compared to million of earnings for this million unfavorable swing is attributed to the composition of firstcity ownership mix in the domestic acquisition partnerships that reported net earnings and losses in compared to firstcity average investment in domestic acquisition partnerships increased to 
table of contents million for from million for  due primarily to increased investment activity in newly formed domestic acquisition partnerships under firstcity investment agreement with v rde see note of the company consolidated financial statements for additional information 
in light of firstcity increased holdings in domestic portfolio assets acquired through equity method investments in unconsolidated acquisition partnerships instead of consolidated portfolio assets over the past year  the company expects equity in earnings of domestic acquisition partnerships to gradually increase over time in comparison to income from consolidated portfolio assets 
latin america total combined revenues reported by our latin american acquisition partnerships firstcity share increased to million in from million in total combined net losses reported by our latin american partnerships decreased to million in compared to million the increase in total partnership revenues and the lower net losses reported by these partnerships in compared to was attributable partly to an increase in collections to million in compared to million in while collections increased modestly  the primary reason for the increased revenues was attributed to the liquidation of a single asset with a nominal cost basis by a latin american partnership in that generated a gain of approximately million 
further contributing to the lower net losses reported by these partnerships in compared to was a million decline in property protection and servicing fee expenses recorded in compared to  and million of additional foreign currency exchange gains recorded in compared to including million of additional foreign currency exchange gains recorded in q compared to q 
the significant increase in foreign currency exchange gains recorded by these partnerships in q compared to q stemmed from the translation impact to their us dollar denominated debt due to the higher appreciation in value of the mexican peso relative to the us dollar in q compared to q 
these favorable results reported by our latin american acquisition partnerships were off set partially by the following a million decline in interest and accretion income in compared to due primarily to an increase in the level of latin american partnership loan portfolios accounted for on a non accrual method of accounting cost recovery or cash basis instead of the interest method ie accrual method  million of additional tax related expense recorded in compared to primarily related to increased income from collections in brazil combined with reversals of certain value added tax receivables in mexico  and million of additional net impairment provisions recorded in compared to the collective activity described above translated to firstcity share of latin american partnership losses totaling million in and million in firstcity average investment in latin american acquisition partnerships decreased to million for compared to million for europe total combined revenues reported by european acquisition partnerships firstcity share decreased to million in from million in in addition  total combined net earnings reported by these european partnerships decreased sharply to million in losses for from million in losses for the decrease in total partnership revenues and increase in total net losses reported by our european acquisition partnerships was attributed primarily to a decrease in collections to million in compared to million in  and million of additional impairment provisions recorded in occurring in q compared to the impairment provisions were recorded primarily by the european acquisition partnerships that were wholly acquired and consolidated by firstcity in december refer to note of the company consolidated financial statements 
these unfavorable results reported by our european acquisition partnerships were off set partially by a million decline in property protection and servicing fee expenses recorded in compared to further contributing to the 
table of contents decline in european partnership revenues was the decrease in the level of portfolio asset holdings by these acquisition partnerships over the past two years see paragraph below 
the collective activity described above translated to an unfavorable increase in firstcity share of european acquisition partnership net losses to million in losses for from million in losses for firstcity average investment in european acquisition partnerships decreased to million for from million for which contributed to a decline in european partnership collections and firstcity share of european partnership revenues as discussed above 
in light of firstcity step acquisition transactions and resulting consolidations of sixteen french entities former unconsolidated european acquisition partnerships in may and eight german entities formerly unconsolidated european acquisition partnerships in december  the company expects income from consolidated portfolio assets to off set the decline in european partnership revenues 
servicing entities total combined revenues reported by our foreign unconsolidated servicing entities firstcity share increased to million in from million in  and total combined net earnings reported by these entities improved to million in net earnings for from million of net losses for the increase in total net earnings reported by these servicing entities was attributed primarily to additional investment income of million recorded in compared to  including million of the increase in q compared to q primarily due to increased investment activity conducted by a european servicing entity in  a million decrease in net impairment provisions recorded in compared to  and a million decrease in income tax provisions in compared to as a result of our ability to recognize foreign tax benefits associated with us gaap adjustments to an unconsolidated european servicing entity local financial statements  combined with the timing of income tax payments made by the foreign servicing entity in its local jurisdiction 
while the income tax provisions decreased in compared to  the income tax provisions actually increased by million in q compared to q due primarily to increased profitability reported by our european servicing entity and recognition of temporary timing differences related to the previously established foreign tax benefit mentioned above

wfcf waived this covenant requirement of the agreement as of december  discussion of critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  the company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial position in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company consolidated financial position and results and require management most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
loan portfolio assets revenue and impairment recognition a substantial majority of the company portfolio assets include acquired loans and loan portfolios with evidence of credit deterioration purchased credit impaired loans 
the company accounts for purchased credit impaired loans at fair value on the acquisition date 
the amounts paid for purchased credit impaired loans reflect the company determination that the loans have experienced deterioration in credit quality since origination and that it is probable the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the underlying loans 
at acquisition  the company reviews each individual loan to determine whether there is evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination and if it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the loan contractual terms 
if both conditions exist  the company determines whether each such loan is to be accounted for individually or whether such loans will be assembled into static pools based on common risk characteristics primarily loan type and collateral 
static pools of individual loan accounts may be established and accounted for as a single economic unit for the recognition of income  principal payments and loss provision 
once a static loan pool is established  individual accounts are generally not added to or removed from the pool unless the company sells  forecloses or writes off the loan 
at acquisition  the company determines the excess of the scheduled contractual payments over all cash flows expected to be collected for the loan or loan pool as an amount that should not be accreted nonaccretable difference 
the excess of the cash flows from the loan or loan pool expected to be collected at acquisition over the initial investment accretable difference is recognized as interest income over the remaining life of the loan or loan pool on a level yield basis accretable yield 
the discount ie the difference between the cost of each loan or loan pool and the related aggregate contractual receivable balance is not recorded because the company does not expect to fully collect each contractual receivable balance 
as a result  these loans and loan pools are recorded at cost which approximates fair value at the time of acquisition 
the company accounts for purchased credit impaired loans using either the interest method or a non accrual method through application of the cost recovery or cash basis method of accounting 
application of the interest method is dependent on management ability to develop a reasonable expectation as to both the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected 
in the event the 
table of contents company cannot develop or establish a reasonable expectation as to both the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected  the company uses the cost recovery or cash basis method of accounting 
interest method of accounting 
under the interest method  an effective interest rate  or irr  is applied to the cost basis of the loan or loan pool 
the excess of the contractual cash flows over expected cash flows cannot be recognized as an adjustment of income or expense or on the balance sheet 
the irr that is calculated when the loan is purchased remains constant as the basis for subsequent impairment testing performed at least quarterly and income recognition 
significant increases in actual  or expected future cash flows  are used first to reverse any existing valuation allowance for that loan or loan pool  and any remaining increase may be recognized prospectively through an upward adjustment of the irr over the remaining life of the loan or loan pool 
any increase to the irr then becomes the new benchmark for impairment testing and income recognition 
subsequent decreases in projected cash flows do not change the irr  but are recognized as an impairment of the cost basis of the loan or loan pool to maintain the then current irr  and are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations through provisions charged to operations  with a corresponding valuation allowance offsetting the loan or loan pool in the consolidated balance sheets 
firstcity establishes valuation allowances for loans and loan pools acquired with credit deterioration to reflect only those losses incurred after acquisition that is  the cash flows expected at acquisition that are no longer expected to be collected 
income from loans and loan pools accounted for under the interest method is accrued based on the irr of each loan or loan pool applied to their respective adjusted cost basis 
gross collections in excess of the interest accrual and impairments will reduce the carrying value of the loan or loan pool  while gross collections less than the interest accrual will increase the carrying value 
the irr is calculated based on the timing and amount of anticipated cash flows using the company proprietary collection models 
cost recovery method of accounting 
if the amount and timing of future cash collections on a loan are not reasonably estimable  the company accounts for such asset on the cost recovery method 
under the cost recovery method  no income is recognized until the company has fully collected the cost of the loan  or until such time as the company considers the timing and amount of collections to be reasonably estimable and begins to recognize income based on the interest method as described above 
at least quarterly  the company performs an evaluation to determine if the remaining amount that is probable of collection is less than the carrying value of the loan or loan pool  and if so  recognizes impairment through provisions charged to operations  with a corresponding valuation allowance offsetting the loan or loan pool in the consolidated balance sheets 
the carrying value of purchased credit impaired loans accounted for under the cost recovery method approximated million at december   and million including million of loans pending management post purchase evaluation at december  cash basis method of accounting 
if only the amount of future cash collections on a loan is reasonably estimable  the company accounts for such asset on an individual loan basis under the cash basis method of accounting 
under the cash basis method  no income is recognized unless collections are received during the period  or until such time as the company considers the timing of collections to be reasonably estimable and begins to recognize income based on the interest method as described above 
income is recognized for the difference between the collections and a pro rata portion of cost on a loan 
cost allocation is based on a proration of actual collections divided by total projected collections on the loan 
significant increases in future cash flows may be recognized prospectively as income over the remaining life of the loan through increased amounts allocated to income when collections are subsequently received 
subsequent decreases in projected cash flows are recognized as impairment of the loan cost basis to maintain a constant cost allocation based on initial projections 
the company evaluates the projected cash flows for these loans and loan pools at least quarterly to determine if impairment exists  and if so  recognizes the impairment through provisions charged to 
table of contents operations  with a corresponding valuation allowance offsetting the loan or loan pool in the consolidated balance sheets 
management implemented the cash basis method of accounting for such eligible loans in as a result of increased uncertainty in the timing of future collections attributable primarily to the borrowers inability to obtain financing to refinance the loans 
the carrying value of purchased credit impaired loans accounted for under the cash basis method approximated million at december   and million at december  real estate portfolio assets valuation and impairment recognition real estate portfolio assets consist of real estate properties purchased from a variety of sellers or acquired through loan foreclosure 
rental income  net of expenses  is generally recognized when received 
the company accounts for its real estate properties on an individual asset basis as opposed to a pool basis 
real estate properties acquired through  or in lieu of  loan foreclosure are initially recorded at the lower of cost ie the underlying loan carrying value or estimated fair value less disposition costs at the date of foreclosure establishing a new cost basis 
the amount  if any  by which the carrying value of the underlying loan exceeds the property fair value less estimated disposition costs at the foreclosure date is charged as a loss against operations 
expenditures for repairs  maintenance  and other holding costs are charged to operations as incurred 
real estate properties acquired through loan foreclosure are classified as held for sale  and carried on the company consolidated balance sheet at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated disposition costs 
real estate is not depreciated while it is classified as held for sale 
impairment losses are recorded if a property fair value less estimated disposition costs is less than its carrying amount  and charged to operations in the period the impairment is identified 
real estate properties acquired through a purchase transaction are initially recorded at the cost of the acquisition 
the cost of acquired property includes the purchase price of the property  legal fees  and certain other acquisition costs 
subsequent to acquisition  the company capitalizes capital improvements and expenditures related to significant betterments and replacements  including costs related to the development and improvement of the property for its intended use 
expenditures for repairs  maintenance  and other holding costs are charged to operations as incurred 
real estate held for investment is carried on the company consolidated balance sheet at cost less depreciation and amortization  as applicable 
the company periodically reviews its property held for investment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of property held for investment is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the property 
if the property is considered impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the property exceeds its fair value 
fair value is determined by discounted cash flows or market comparisons 
loans receivable valuation and impairment recognition loans held for sale the portions of us small business administration sba loans that are guaranteed by the sba are classified by management as loans held for sale 
these loans are recorded at the lower of aggregate cost or estimated fair value 
the fair value of sba loans held for sale is based primarily on what secondary markets are currently offering for loans with similar characteristics  or the contractual price for loan sales already consummated but which cannot be recognized as accounting sales until the expiration of a recourse period 
net unrealized losses  if any  are recognized through a valuation allowance through a charge to income 
the carrying value of sba loans held for sale is net of premiums as well as deferred origination fees and costs 
premiums and net origination fees and costs 
table of contents are deferred and included in the basis of the loans in calculating gains and losses upon sale 
sba loans are generally secured by the borrowing entities assets such as accounts receivable  property and equipment  and other business assets 
the company generally sells the guaranteed portion of each loan to a third party investor and retains the servicing rights 
the non guaranteed portion of sba loans is classified as held for investment discussed below 
as discussed under the heading effects of newly adopted accounting standards below  effective january   the company adopted new accounting guidance that requires sba loan transactions subject to the sba premium recourse provision to be accounted for initially as secured borrowings rather than asset sales 
after the premium recourse provisions have elapsed  the transaction will be recorded as a sale and the resulting net gain on sale will be recognized which is based on the difference between the proceeds received and the allocated carrying value of the loan sold 
it should be noted that effective january   the sba removed the recourse provisions contained in its loan sales agreements for guaranteed portions of sba loans 
as a result  sba loan sales transacted by the company under these revised agreements will be accounted for initially as a sale  with the corresponding gain or loss recognized at the time of sale 
loans held for investment loans receivable consisting of loans made to affiliated entities including acquisition partnerships and other equity method investees and non affiliated entities  and the non guaranteed portions of sba loans  are classified by management as held for investment 
these loans are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income  charge offs  unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans  and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans 
loan origination fees and costs  as well as purchase premiums and discounts  are amortized as level yield adjustments over the respective loan terms 
unamortized net fees  costs  premiums or discounts are recognized upon early repayment or sale of the loan 
repayment of the loans is generally dependent upon future cash flows of the borrowers  future cash flows of the underlying collateral  and distributions made from affiliated entities 
interest is accrued when earned in accordance with the contractual terms of the loans 
interest is recognized on an accrual basis at the applicable interest rate on the principal amount outstanding 
the company has established an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable  estimable losses inherent in its portfolio of loans receivable held for investment 
this allowance for loan losses includes specific allowances  based on individual evaluations of certain loans and loan relationships  and allowances for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics 
management determination of the adequacy of the allowance is a quarterly process and is based on evaluating the collectibility of the loans in light of various factors  as applicable  such as quality and composition of the loan portfolio segments  estimated future cash receipts of the borrower operations or underlying collateral  historical experience  estimated value of underlying collateral  prevailing economic conditions  industry concentrations and conditions  and other relevant factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
actual losses experienced in the future may vary from management estimates 
management attributes portions of the allowance to loans that it evaluates and determines to be impaired and to groups of loans that it evaluates collectively 
in determining the appropriate level of allowance  management uses information to stratify its portfolio of loans receivable held for investment into loan pools with common risk characteristics 
classes in the affiliated and non affiliated portfolio asset and commercial loan portfolio segments are generally disaggregated by accrual status which is generally based on management assessment on the probability of default 
classes in the non guaranteed sba commercial loan portfolio segment are disaggregated based upon underlying credit quality 
certain portions of the allowance are attributed to loan pools based on various factors and analyses  including but not limited to  current and historical loss experience trends  collateral  region  current economic conditions  and industry concentrations and 
table of contents conditions 
loans deemed to be impaired  including loans with an increased probability of default as determined by management  are evaluated individually rather than on a pool basis as described above 
we consider a loan to be impaired when  based on current information and events  we determine it is probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the loan contractual terms including scheduled interest payments 
when management identifies a loan as impaired  we measure the impairment based on discounted future cash flows  except when foreclosure is probable or the source of repayment is the operation or liquidation of the collateral 
in these cases  we use the current fair value of the collateral  less estimated selling costs  instead of discounted cash flows 
when a loan is determined to be impaired  we cease to accrue interest on the note and interest previously accrued but not collected becomes part of our recorded investment in the loan and is collectively reviewed for impairment 
when ultimate collectibility of the impaired note is in doubt  all collections are applied to reduce the principal amount of such notes until the principal has been recovered  and collections thereafter are recognized as interest income 
we return a loan to accrual status when we determine that the collectibility of principal and interest is reasonably assured 
impairment losses are charged against an allowance account through provisions charged to operations in the period impairment is identified 
loans are written off against the allowance when all possible means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
deferred tax assets valuation the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities in both us and foreign jurisdictions based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
accordingly  the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed periodically by the company based on the more likely than not realization threshold criterion 
in the assessment  appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets 
this assessment considers  among other factors  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  excess of appreciated asset value over the tax basis of net assets  the duration of statutory carryforward periods  the company experience with utilizing available operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  and tax planning strategies 
this process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws between our projected operating performance  our actual results and other factors 
for purposes of evaluating the need for a deferred tax valuation allowance  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
at december  and  the company established a full valuation allowance for its us deferred tax assets due to the lack of sufficient objective evidence regarding the realization of these assets in the foreseeable future 
regardless of the deferred tax valuation allowance established at december   the company continues to retain net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million available to offset future federal taxable income  if any  through the year to the extent that the company generates taxable income in the future to utilize the tax benefits of the related deferred tax assets  subject to certain potential limitations  it may be able to reduce its effective tax rate by reducing the valuation allowance 

table of contents we believe that the accounting estimate for the valuation of deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because judgment is required in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and  in certain cases  business plans and other expectations about future outcomes 
changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results and future business results  including further market deterioration  may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
changes that are not anticipated in our current estimates could have a material period to period impact on our financial position or results of operations 
estimates of cash receipts on portfolio assets the company uses estimates to determine future cash receipts from portfolio assets 
these estimates of future cash receipts from portfolio assets are utilized in four primary ways i to calculate the allocation of cost of certain non performing portfolios assets  ii to determine the effective yield of performing portfolios assets  iii to determine the reasonableness of settlement offers received in the liquidation of the portfolio assets  and iv to determine whether or not there is impairment in our portfolio assets 
the company uses proprietary programs and collection models to manage the portfolio assets it owns and services 
each asset within a pool is analyzed by an account manager who is responsible for analyzing the characteristics of each asset within a pool 
the account manager projects future cash receipts and expenses related to each asset  the sum of which provides the total estimated future cash receipts related to a particular purchased asset pool 
these estimates are routinely monitored by the company to determine reasonableness of the estimates provided 
consolidation policy the company consolidated financial statements include the accounts of firstcity  its wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries  and certain variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary as prescribed by the financial accounting standards board the fasb accounting guidance on variable interest entities 
if we determine that we have a controlling financial interest in an entity  then we must consolidate the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the entity in our consolidated financial statements 
a controlling financial interest typically arises as a result of ownership of a majority of the voting interests of an entity 
however  we may also have a controlling financial interest in an entity through an arrangement that does not involve voting interests  such as a variable interest entity vie 
in general  a vie is an entity that has one or more of the following characteristics the entity has total equity at risk that is not sufficient to finance its principal activities without additional subordinated financial support from other entities  the group of equity owners does not have the ability to make significant decisions about the entity activities  the group of equity owners does not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive residual returns generated by its operations  or both  or the voting rights of some investors are not proportional to their obligations to absorb the losses or the right to receive residual returns of the entity  or both  and substantially all of the entity activities either involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights 
if any of these characteristics is present  the entity is subject to a variable interests consolidation analysis  and consolidation is based on variable interests  and not solely on ownership of the entity outstanding voting stock 
variable interests are generally defined as contractual  ownership or other economic interests in an entity that change with fluctuations in the entity net asset value 
the company consolidates any vie of which it is the primary beneficiary 
the 
table of contents primary beneficiary of a vie is the party that has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the entity 
the assessment of the party that has the power to direct the activities of the vie may require significant management judgment when more than one party has power  or more than one party is involved in the design of the vie but no party has the power to direct the ongoing activities that could be significant 
refer to note of the company consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company investments in vies 
the company does not consolidate equity investments in to owned entities that are not vies where the company does not have an effective controlling interest  or equity investments in to owned entities that are vies where the company is not the primary beneficiary 
rather  such investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting since the company has the ability to exercise significant influence over the investees operating and financial policies 
the company also accounts for its unconsolidated equity investments in less than owned entities under the equity method of accounting 
firstcity has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of these entities  despite its comparatively smaller ownership percentage  due primarily to its active participation in the policy making process as well as its involvement in the daily management activities 
these entities are formed generally to share in the risks and rewards in developing new markets as well as to pool resources 
under the equity method of accounting  the company investment in these unconsolidated entities is carried at the cost of acquisition  plus the company share of equity in undistributed earnings or losses since acquisition 
effects of newly adopted accounting standards consolidation of variable interest entities vies effective january   the company adopted the fasb accounting guidance on the consolidation of vies issued in june 
this new guidance eliminates the exemption for qspes  revises previous guidance by replacing the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise  if any  has a controlling financial interest in a vie with a qualitative approach focused on identifying which enterprise has both the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impacts the entity economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the entity  requires reconsideration of whether an entity is a vie when any changes in facts and circumstances occur such that the holders of the equity investment at risk  as a group  lose the power from voting rights or similar rights of those investments to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity economic performance  and requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie and additional disclosures about an enterprise involvement in vies 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
transfers of financial assets effective january   the company adopted the fasb guidance on accounting for transfers of financial assets issued in june 
this guidance amends previous guidance which  among other changes  eliminates the concept of a qspe  changes the requirements for de recognizing financial assets  defines the term participating interest to establish specific conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale  and requires additional disclosures 
the recognition and measurement provisions are effective for transfers occurring on or after january  the new accounting guidance delays the company recognition of the sale of guaranteed portions of sba loans until expiration of the premium recourse provisions  and requires such transactions to be accounted for initially as a secured borrowing 
as such  the company did not recognize any gains related to sba loan sales for the first three months of once the premium recourse provisions have elapsed  the 
table of contents transaction will be recorded as a sale with the guaranteed portion of the sba loan and the secured borrowing removed from the balance sheet and the resulting gain on sale recorded 
it should be noted that effective january   the sba removed the recourse provisions contained in its loan sales agreements for guaranteed portions of sba loans 
as a result  sba loan sales transacted by the company under these revised agreements will be accounted for initially as a sale  with the corresponding gain or loss recognized at the time of sale 
fair value measurements disclosure in january  the fasb issued new accounting guidance that amended existing guidance for fair value disclosures 
this guidance requires separate disclosures of significant transfers of items in and out of levels and in the fair value hierarchy  and to describe the reasons for the transfers 
the updated guidance also clarifies  among other things  that fair value measurement disclosures should be provided for each class of assets and liabilities  and that disclosures of inputs and valuation techniques should be provided for both recurring and non recurring level and level fair value measurements 
we adopted this new guidance for the quarterly period ended march  since this guidance is disclosure only in nature  our adoption of the guidance did not significantly impact the company consolidated financial statements 
finance receivables and allowance for credit losses disclosure in july  the fasb issued accounting guidance related to disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses 
the amended guidance applies to all financing receivables except for short term trade receivables and receivables measured at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value 
the objective of the amendment is disclosure of information that enables financial statement users to understand the nature of inherent credit risks  the entity method of analysis and assessment of credit risk in estimating the allowance for credit losses  and the reasons for changes in both the receivables and allowances when examining a creditor portfolio of financing receivables and its allowance for losses 
under the new guidance  the disaggregation of financing receivables will be disclosed by portfolio segment or by class of financing receivable 
the company adopted the period end disclosure requirements of this guidance related to an entity credit quality of financing receivables and the related allowance for loan losses in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the company will adopt the activity related provisions of this guidance in the first quarter of the disclosure requirements regarding troubled debt restructurings have been delayed by the fasb 
while the provisions of this guidance require significant expansion of the company disclosures on the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for loan losses  the period end provisions did not have an impact on the company financial condition and results of operations  and the company does not expect the adoption of the remaining disclosure provisions to have a material effect on the company financial condition and results of operations 
loan modifications and loan pool accounting in april  the fasb issued guidance that clarifies the accounting for loan modifications when the loan is part of a pool that is accounted for as a single asset 
the new guidance provides that modifications of loans that are accounted for within a pool do not result in the removal of those loans from the pool even if the modification of those loans would otherwise be considered a troubled debt restructuring 
an entity will continue to be required to consider whether the pool of assets in which the loan is included is impaired if expected cash flows for the pool change 
this guidance does not affect the accounting for loans that are not accounted for within pools 
loans accounted for individually continue to be subject to the troubled debt restructuring accounting provisions 
the new guidance also allows entities to make a one time election to terminate accounting for loans in a pool  which may be 
table of contents made on a pool by pool basis  upon adoption of this new guidance 
we early adopted the provisions of this new guidance  as permitted  effective april  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
effect of newly issued accounting standards in january  the fasb issued updated guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures  which requires a reporting entity to disclose separately  a reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements that is  on a gross basis rather than one net number 
the updated guidance is effective for interim or annual financial reporting periods beginning after december  and for interim periods within the fiscal year 
since this guidance is disclosure only in nature  management does not expect the adoption of this updated guidance to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations
