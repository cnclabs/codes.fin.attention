an exploration stage enterprise notes to consolidated financial statements all amounts in tables are in thousands of us dollars  except per share amounts and number of shares  unless noted otherwise nature of operations we evaluate  acquire and explore gold exploration and potential development projects 
as such  we are considered an exploration stage enterprise 
our approach to acquisitions of gold projects has generally been to seek projects within political jurisdictions with well established mining  land ownership and tax laws  which have adequate drilling and geological data to support the completion of a third party review of the geological data and to complete an estimate of the gold mineralization 
in addition  we look for opportunities to improve the value of our gold projects through exploration drilling  and or reengineering the operating assumptions underlying previous engineering work 
we are continuing to move our more advanced projects through advanced and pre feasibility studies in preparation for mine development so that production decisions can be made on those projects significant accounting policies and united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap we have  since our inception  reported to security regulators in both canada and the us using canadian gaap financial statements with a reconciliation to us gaap 
however  a change in sec position in late required canadian companies such as vista gold that do not qualify as foreign private issuers  to file their financial statements in the us using us gaap after december  we therefore have adopted us gaap as of january  for all subsequent us and canadian filings 
canadian securities regulators have announced that they will continue to accept us gaap financial statements 
significant accounting policies a generally accepted accounting principles the consolidated financial statements of vista gold and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in canada 
for the purposes of these financial statements  these principles conform  in all material respects  with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  except as described in note b principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of vista gold and its subsidiaries

table of contents vista gold corp 
an exploration stage enterprise notes to consolidated financial statements all amounts in tables are in thousands of us dollars  except per share amounts and number of shares  unless noted otherwise c use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant areas requiring the use of estimates include mine closure and reclamation obligations  useful lives for asset depreciation purposes  impairment of mineral properties  the calculation of stock based compensation  the calculation of the equity component of our notes and the calculation of the value of warrants issued 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
d foreign currency translation all of our foreign subsidiaries are considered to be integrated foreign operations 
the accounts of our integrated foreign operations are translated using the temporal method 
under this method  monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the year end rate of exchange  non monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates prevailing at the respective transaction dates  and revenue and expenses  except for depreciation  are translated at the average rate of exchange during the year 
translation gains and losses are reflected in the loss for the year 
e cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand  demand balances held with banks  and certificates of deposit all with maturities of three months or less when purchased 
f allowance for accounts receivable we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivables based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of an entity s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
g marketable securities all available for sale securities are measured at fair value 
gains and losses associated with these available for sale securities are separately recorded as unrealized within other comprehensive income until such time the security is disposed of or becomes impaired  at which time any gains or losses will then be realized and reclassified to the statement of loss 
all regular way purchases of financial assets are accounted for at trade date 
transaction costs on available for sale financial assets are treated as part of the investment cost 
effective september   we adopted the emerging issues committee abstract eic  income statement presentation of a tax loss carryforward recognized following an unrealized gain in other comprehensive income 
eic provides guidance on whether the tax benefit from the recognition of previously unrecognized tax loss carryforwards consequent to the recording of unrealized gains in other comprehensive income  such as unrealized gains on available for sale financial assets  should be recognized in net income or in other comprehensive income 
eic should be applied retrospectively  with restatement of prior periods from january   the date of adoption of cica as defined below section  financial instruments recognition and measurement 
h mineral properties mineral property acquisition costs and exploration expenditures are recorded at cost and are deferred until the viability of the property is determined 
no properties have reached the development stage at this time 
general overhead  administrative and holding costs to maintain a property on a care and maintenance basis are expensed in the period they are incurred 
if a project is put into production  capitalized costs are depleted on the unit of production basis 
option payments and reimbursements received are treated as a recovery of mineral property costs 
option payments are at the discretion of the optionee and accordingly are accounted for on a cash basis or when receipt is reasonably assured 
our management regularly reviews the net carrying value of each mineral property 
where information and conditions suggest impairment  estimated future net cash flows from each property are calculated using estimated future 
table of contents vista gold corp 
an exploration stage enterprise notes to consolidated financial statements all amounts in tables are in thousands of us dollars  except per share amounts and number of shares  unless noted otherwise prices  proven and probable reserves and value beyond proven and probable reserves  and operating  capital and reclamation costs on an undiscounted basis 
if it is determined that the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value  a write down to the estimated fair value is made with a charge to loss for the period 
where estimates of future net cash flows are not available and where other conditions suggest impairment  management assesses if the carrying value can be recovered 
management s estimates of gold prices  recoverable proven and probable reserves  probable outcomes  operating capital and reclamation costs are subject to risks and uncertainties that may affect the recoverability of mineral property costs 
although management has made their best estimate of these factors based on current conditions  it is possible that changes could occur in the near term that could adversely affect management s estimate of net cash flows expected to be generated and the need for possible asset impairment write downs 
although we have taken steps to verify title to mineral properties in which we have an interest  these procedures do not guarantee our title 
such properties may be subject to prior undetected agreements or transfers and title may be affected by such defects 
i property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  ranging primarily from three to ten years 
significant expenditures  which increase the life of an asset  are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset 
upon sale or retirement of assets  the costs and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the respective accounts and any resulting gains or losses are reflected in operations 
j asset retirement obligation and closure costs the fair value of a liability for our legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets is recognized in the period in which it is incurred 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset unless the asset has been previously written off  in which case the amount is expensed 
the liability will be adjusted for changes in the expected amounts and timing of cash flows required to discharge the liability and accreted to the full value over time through periodic charges to income 
k loss per share loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss for the year by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year 
the effect of potential issuances of common share equivalents under options and warrants would be anti dilutive and therefore  basic and diluted losses per share are the same 
l stock based compensation we record compensation expense on the granting of all stock based compensation awards  including stock options grants  restricted stock units grants and restricted stock awards grants  calculated using the fair value method 
we use the hull white trinomial method of determining the fair value of the stock option on the date of the grant 
when an employee or non employee is granted stock options  the fair value of the immediately vested portion is expensed and included within the stock options balance within equity 
as to the options vesting  the fair value is amortized using the straight line method over the vesting period and expensed on a monthly basis 
when an employee or non employee exercises stock options  then the fair value of the options on the date of the grant is transferred to common stock 
when options are cancelled  the vested fair value balance of the stock options is transferred to contributed surplus 
when stock options are forfeited prior to becoming fully vested  any expense previously recorded is reversed through income 
when options expire  the related fair value is transferred to contributed surplus 
we use the intrinsic method of determining the fair value of restricted stock units and restricted stock awards on the date of grant 
the fair value is amortized using the straight line method over the vesting period and expensed on a monthly basis 
on the date of vesting  the fair value of the restricted stock units or restricted stock awards on the date of grant is transferred to common stock 
when restricted stock units or restricted stock awards are forfeited prior to vesting  any expense previously recorded is reversed through income

an exploration stage enterprise notes to consolidated financial statements all amounts in tables are in thousands of us dollars  except per share amounts and number of shares  unless noted otherwise financial instrument risk exposure and risk management we are exposed in varying degrees to a variety of financial instrument related risks 
management approves and monitors the risk management processes 
the types of risk exposure and the way in which such exposure is managed is provided as follows credit risk our credit risk is primarily attributable to our cash and cash equivalents 
we monitors our cash and cash equivalents in order to limit our exposure to credit risk 
we do not have any financial assets that are invested in asset backed commercial paper 
liquidity risk we ensure that there is sufficient capital in order to meet short term business requirements  after taking into account our holdings of cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from financing activities 
we believe that these sources will be sufficient to cover the likely short and long term cash requirements 
our cash and cash equivalents are held in interest bearing liquid savings accounts 
market risk the significant market risk exposure to which we are exposed is interest rate risk 
our policy is to invest cash at floating rates of interest in short term highly liquid cash savings accounts in order to maintain liquidity 
fluctuations in interest therefore have little impact on the value of cash equivalents and short term investments 
with respect to financial liabilities  the convertible notes are not subject to interest rate risk because they bear interest at a fixed rate and are not subject to fluctuations in interest 
capital disclosures our objectives when managing capital are to safeguard our access to sufficient funding as needed to continue our development of mineral properties and to maintain a flexible capital structure which optimizes the costs of capital at an acceptable level of risk 
in the management of capital  we include the components of shareholders equity and debt 
we manage the capital structure and make adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets 
to maintain or adjust the capital structure  we may issue new shares  issue new debt  acquire or dispose of assets or adjust the amount of investments 
we have no restrictions or covenants on our capital structure as of the end of in order to facilitate the management of our capital requirements  we prepare annual expenditure budgets which project expected cash and debt positions over several years and which are updated as necessary depending on various factors  including successful capital deployment and general industry conditions 
the annual and updated budgets are approved by the board of directors 
in order to maximize cash available for development efforts  we do not pay dividends 
our cash investment policy is to invest our cash in highly liquid short term interest bearing investments with maturities of three months or less when acquired  selected with regards to the expected timing of expenditures from operations

when proven and probable reserves are determined for a property and a bankable feasibility study is completed  then subsequent development costs on the property would be capitalized 
total capitalized cost of such properties is measured periodically for recoverability of carrying value under asc property  plant and equipment 
under canadian gaap  all such costs are permitted to be capitalized 
b under canadian corporate law  we underwent a capital reduction in connection with the amalgamation of granges  inc granges and hycroft resources development  inc whereby share capital and contributed surplus were reduced to eliminate the consolidated accumulated deficit of granges as of december   after giving effect to the estimated costs of amalgamation 
under us corporate law  no such transaction is available and accordingly is not allowed under us gaap 
c in accordance with us gaap asc compensation stock expense  the fair value of all options granted after january  is calculated at the date of grant and expensed over the expected vesting period 
on transition to this new standard  the unvested portion of options granted to employees before january  is expensed over the remaining vesting period using the fair value on the date of grant 
prior to january   we did not record any compensation cost on the granting of stock options to employees and directors as the exercise price was equal to or greater than the market price at the date of grants for us gaap purposes under apb opinion no 
asc compensation stock expense essentially aligns us gaap with canadian gaap for accounting for stock based compensation 
d in accordance with us gaap  the entire amount of convertible debt is classified as a liability and recorded at fair value on the date of issuance and issuance costs are classified as a deferred asset and amortized over the life of the convertible debt 
under canadian gaap  the fair value of the conversion feature of the convertible debt is classified as equity and the residual balance is classified as a liability 
under canadian gaap  issuance costs are netted against the debt and equity portions pro rata 
the liability portion is accreted each period in amounts which will increase the liability to its full face amount of the convertible instrument as of the maturity date 
e in accordance with us gaap asc income taxes  the reversal of a valuation allowance which is directly related to the gain or loss of available for sale securities  when a corporation has no expectations of taxable income in future periods  is recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
under canadian gaap  we adopted eic  effective september  this standard requires the recognition of the tax benefit or loss of previously unrecognized tax loss carryforwards associated with the unrealized holding gains and losses of available for sale securities to be recognized in net income or net loss 
this abstract required retrospective restatement of all prior periods beginning with january  the adoption of eic resulted in a future income tax expense being recorded as part of our net loss  whereas under asc income taxes the future income tax expense would be recorded as part of our comprehensive loss

these new standards amend the evaluation criteria to identify the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and require ongoing reassessment of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity

these standards became effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal the adoption of the new standards will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 fair value measurements disclosures  which amends subtopic of the fasb accounting standards codification to require new disclosures for fair value measurements and provides clarification for existing disclosure requirements 
more specifically  this update will require a an entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of levels and fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers  and b information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements to be presented separately ie present the activity on a gross basis rather than net in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant  unobservable inputs level inputs 
this update clarifies existing disclosure requirements for the level of disaggregation used for classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value  and requires disclosure about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements using level and level inputs 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will materially expand our consolidated financial statement footnote disclosures
