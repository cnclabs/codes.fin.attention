critical accounting policies the corporation s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing the corporation s financial statements management makes estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
our significant accounting policies are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the most significant subjective judgments that it makes include the following allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principals of accounting i accounting standards codification asc no 
contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable and ii asc  receivables  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
an allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based upon industry standards  known risk characteristics  and management s evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of loan activity 
such evaluation considers among other factors  the estimated market value of the underlying collateral  and current economic conditions 
for further information about our practices with respect to allowance for loan losses  please see the subsection allowance for loan losses below 
other than temporary impairment of investment securities the bank s investment portfolio is classified as available for sale 
the estimated fair value of the portfolio fluctuates due to changes in market interest rates and other factors 
changes in estimated fair value are recorded in stockholders equity as a component of comprehensive income 
securities are monitored to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporary 
management evaluates the investment portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine the collectability of amounts due per the contractual terms of the investment security 
a decline in the fair value of an investment below its amortized cost attributable to factors that indicate the decline will not be recovered over the anticipated holding period of the investment is considered other than temporarily impaired 
other than temporary impairments result in reducing the security s carrying value by the amount of the estimated credit loss 
the credit component of the other than temporary impairment loss is realized through the statement of income and the remainder of the loss remains in other comprehensive income 
at december  there were no securities in the securities portfolio with other than temporary impairment 
income taxes the corporation uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
this method results in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities that are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled 
as changes in tax laws or rates are enacted  deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes 
the deferred provision for income taxes is the result of the net change in the deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability balances during the year 
this amount combined with the current taxes payable or refundable results in the income tax expense for the current year 
our evaluation of the deductibility or taxability of items included in the corporation s tax returns has not result ed in the identification of any material  uncertain tax positions 
fair value fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions 
fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates  credit risk  prepayments and other factors  especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items 
changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect the estimates 
the fair value estimates of existing on and off balance sheet financial instruments do not include the value of anticipated future business or the values of assets and liabilities not considered financial instruments 
for additional information about our financial assets carried at fair value  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
executive summary the corporation completed its eleventh year of operation and recorded net income of million or per diluted common share in compared to million or per diluted common share in the decrease in net income over last year was due to record performance during by our mortgage subsidiary that was not repeated in due to a decline in refinancing activity 
in the dollar volume of mortgage loan originations excluding brokered loans decreased which contributed to a decrease in income before taxes of for the mortgage segment 
income before taxes from the banking segment increased from to  partially due to a million decrease in the provision for loan losses as credit quality issues improved 
the target federal funds rate remained at basis points during the impact of this historically low interest rate environment has negatively affected yields of variable loans and the securities portfolio however the lower cost of funds was favorable 
despite the low interest rate environment net interest margin in was consistent with at december  assets totaled million compared to million at december  total loans held for investment were million at december  an increase of approximately million over last year 
while the overall increase in total loans held for investment is nominal  our commercial loan portfolio increased million or in this increase is due in part to our focus on small to medium sized businesses and providing credit facilities in conjunction with the us small business administration s sba guaranteed loan program 
the bank was recognized by the sba as the leading bank provider of sba loans originated in the washington metropolitan area for the fiscal year ended september  the sba lending activity is an import ant component of our focus on small businesses and expanding our core business relationships 
investment securities totaled million at december  compared to million at december  the growth in the investment portfolio is attributable to excess liquidity provided by deposit growth and modest net loan growth during all of the securities purchased in were government agencies 
deposits totaled million at december  compared to million at december  noninterest bearing deposit balances totaled approximately million compared to million at december   a increase 
non performing assets npa totaled approximately million or of assets at december   down from million or of assets at december  npa are comprised of non accrual loans totaling million and other real estate owned of million 
the allowance for loan losses totaled million or of total loans held for investment as of december   compared to million or at december  during the fourth quarter  access national mortgage reached settlement arrangements with its two largest mortgage investors wherein payments of million were made to these investors to release the mortgage corporation from known and unknown repurchase obligations associated with approximately billion of mortgage loans 
one agreement covers all loans originated prior to and the other agreement covers all loans originated through december  loans covered under the agreements included a disproportionate share of the non prime and wholesale channel loans sold by the company during the applicable period that pose  in the company s estimation and experience  the greatest repurchase potential 
the wholesale and non prime loan programs were terminated by the company in after remova l of loans covered under the referenced settlement agreements and accounting for repayments  the company estimates there is approximately billion of loans sold with remaining balances outstanding for which there may be potential liability  consisting of billion in government insured loans  million in prime loans and less than million in non prime loans 
with respect to ongoing repurchase liability  the mortgage corporation s loss experience in order of magnitude has been greatest to lowest in non prime loans  prime loans and government loans  respectively 
the mortgage corporation has undertaken an extensive analysis of historical run off rates  claim rates and loss rates given validated claims  in order to formulate a methodology for evaluating loss potential of claims 
the million settlement was paid from the existing allowance for loan losses on mortgage loans sold 
the mortgage corporation estimates that its remaining reserve of approximately million is adequate for all current and future exposure on previous period loan sales that are not covered under the referenced agreements 
the mortgage corporation continues to apply a loss reserve methodology to current production that results in a provision expense in each period 
since adoption of representation and warranty loss reserve accounting in  the reserve has proven adequate in each period to absorb all validated claims 
while we continue to see signs of improvement in the economy  the health of the residential real estate market remains critical to any economic recovery 
the resale housing market is stabilizing across most of the greater washington dc metropolitan area although price gains have been largely confined to northern virginia with average sales prices up by approximately percent from last year 
fairfax county s unemployment rate at is the third lowest of the major jurisdictions making up the greater washington metropolitan dc area 
the unemployment rate for the surrounding counties of arlington and loudoun was and respectively 
although we believe that the credit quality of our primary business and professional customers has stabilized and has begun to improve  we will continue to focus on improving the credit quality of our loan portfolio and reducing non performing assets 
the corporation is optimistic going into with a strong capital base and positioned for continued growth 
results of operations net income for totaled million  or per diluted common share compared to million or per diluted common share in earnings in were impacted by a decrease in income generated from the mortgage banking segment as a result of a decrease in gains on sale of loans resulting from decline in mortgage loan originations from to interest and dividend income for totaled million  down from million in primarily due to changes in the composition of earning assets 
during average loans held for investment decreased million and average investment securities increased million 
average interest bearing balances and federal funds sold increased million from to net income for totaled million  or

net interest income improved from million in to million in due to lower rates on deposits and borrowings 
net interest income net interest income is the amount of income generated by earning assets primarily loans and investment securities less the interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities primarily deposits used to fund earning assets 
net interest income and margin are influenced by many factors  primarily the volume and mix of earning assets  funding sources  yields on earning assets and interest rate fluctuations 
net interest income totaled million in  up from million in average earning assets increased million from million in to million in average interest bearing deposits and liabilities increased million in net interest margin was in and in the weighted average yield on earning assets decreased basis points while the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points 
average earning assets were impacted during by a million increase in investment securities combined with a million increase in interest bearing balances and federal funds sold and a decrease in loans held for investment 
the increase in lower yielding investment securities and interest bearing deposits contributed to the basis points decrease in yield on earning assets 
during the target federal funds rate remained in a range of to and the prime rate was unchanged at 
this low rate environment contributed to the basis points decrease in funding costs

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses charged to operating expense in was million compared million in and million in in the provision for loan losses decreased from as the volume of net charge offs dropped and the rate of increase in the allowance for loan losses declined as dictated by the allowance for loan loss methodology employed by the bank 
the amount is determined by management to restore the allowance for loan losses to a level believed to be adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio based on evaluations as of december  noninterest income noninterest income consists of revenue generated from service fees on deposit accounts  gains on sale of loans and other charges  and fees 
the mortgage corporation provides the most significant contributions towards noninterest income and is subject to wide fluctuations due to the general interest rate environment and economic conditions 
total noninterest income was million in compared to million in gains on the sale of loans originated by the mortgage corporation totaled million in compared to million in gains on the sale of loans decreased in  as a result of a million decrease in mortgage loan originations 
other income decreased million in as a result of losses incurred on hedging activities associated with the origination of mortgage loans held for sale 
when losses occur on instruments used to hedge interest rate risk the value of the loans being hedged increases proportionately and are recognized in gains on the sale of loans

the decrease is due to the decrease in volume of mortgage loan originations in and corresponding reductions in performance based compensation 
other operating expense totaled million in  down from million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
the decrease is attributable to the following expense categories 
the provision for losses on mortgage loans sold decreased million  due in part to the decrease in loan originations and other factors considered by management in determining the level of the allowance for losses on mortgage loans sold 
as detailed in the executive summary of this report  settlements with the mortgage corporation s two largest counterparties were made in the fourth quarter of that released the mortgage corporation from any future known and unknown claims related to approximately billion of mortgage loans sold which significantly decreased the amount of required reserves at year end management fees associated with the operation of certain offices of the mortgage corporation  decreased million largely due to the decrease in mortgage loans originated 
advertising expense decreased million due to a reduction in direct mail marketing 
noninterest expense totaled million in compared to million in compensation and employee benefits  the largest component of noninterest expense  totaled million in compared to million in  an increase of million 
the increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in compensation and benefits at the mortgage corporation and relates to the increased volume of loan originations in other operating expense totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million in  an increase of million 
the increase is attributable to the following expense categories advertising expense million primarily at the mortgage corporation  million in investor fees paid in co njunction with selling mortgage loans  million in management fees associated with the operation of certain offices of the mortgage corporation  million in the provision for losses on mortgage loans sold  million in fdic premiums

interest bearing deposits in other banks and federal funds sold at december  interest bearing balances in other banks totaled million compared to million december  these balances are maintained at the frb and the fhlb of atlanta and provide liquidity for managing daily cash inflows and outflows from deposits and loans 
investment securities the corporation s investment securities portfolio is comprised of us treasury securities  us government agency securities  municipal securities  cra mutual fund  and mortgage backed securities issued by us government sponsored agencies 
the investment portfolio is used to provide liquidity and as a tool for managing interest sensitivity in the balance sheet  while generating income 
at december   the balance of us government agency securities included approximately million of securities that were purchased during as a result of excess liquidity due to securities that were called  weak loan demand  and growth in deposits

charge offs are taken when a loan is identified as uncollectible 
the methodology by which we systematically determine the amount of our allowance is set forth by the board of directors in our loan policy and implemented by management 
the results of the analysis are documented  reviewed and approved by the board of directors no less than quarterly 
the level of the allowance for loan losses is determined by management through an ongoing  detailed analysis of historical loss rates and risk characteristics 
during each quarter  management evaluates the collectability of all loans in the portfolio and ensures an accurate risk rating is assigned to each loan 
the risk rating scale and definitions commonly adopted by the federal banking agencies is contained within the framework prescribed by the bank s loan policy 
any loan that is deemed to have potential or well defined weaknesses that may jeopardize collection in full is then analyzed to ascertain its level of weakness 
if appropriate  the loan may be charged off or a specific reserve may be assigned if the loan is deemed to be impaired 
during the risk rating verification process  each loan identified as inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged is considered impaired and is placed on non accrual status 
on these loans  management analyzes the potential impairment of the individual loan and may set aside a specific reserve 
any amounts deemed uncollectible during that analysis are charged off 
for the remaining loans in each segment  the bank calculates the probability of loss as a group using the risk rating for each of the following loan types commercial real estate  residential real estate  commercial  real estate construction  and consumer 
management calculates the historical loss rate in each group by risk rating using a period of at least three years 
this historical loss rate may then be adjusted based on management s assessment of internal and external environmental factors 
this adjustment is meant to account for changes between the historical economic environment and current conditions  and for changes in the ongoing management of the portfolio which affects the loans potential loss 
once complete  management compares the condition of the portfolio using several different characteristics  as well as its experience  to the experience of other banks in its peer group in order to determine if it is directionally consistent with others experience in our area and line of business 
based on that analysis  management aggregates the probabilities of loss of the remaining portfolio based on the specific and general allowances and may provide additional amounts to the allowance for loan losses as needed 
since this process involves estimates  the allowance for loan losses may also contain an amount that is non material which is not allocated to a specific loan or to a group of loans but is deemed necessary to absorb additional losses in the portfolio 
management and the board of directors subject the reserve adequacy and methodology to review on a regular basis to internal auditors  external auditors and bank regulators  and such reviews have not resulted in any material adjustment to the reserve

the loans are carried at the current net realizable value after consideration of million in specific reserves 
included in non accrual loans at december  are restructured loans which consisted of two commercial loans totaling thousand and one commercial real estate loan in the amount of thousand 
there were no restructured loans prior to the bank considers restructurings of loans to troubled borrowers when it is deemed to be beneficial to the borrower and improves the prospects for complete recovery of the debt 
the accrual of interest is discontinued at the time a loan is days delinquent unless the credit is well secured and in process of collection 
when a loan is placed on non accrual  accrued and unpaid interest is reversed from interest income 
subsequent receipts on non accrual loans are recorded as a reduction to the principal balance 
interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured 
the loss potential for each loan has been evaluated and in management s opinion the risk of loss is adequately reserved against 
management actively works with the borrowers to maximize the potential for repayment and reports on the status to the board of directors monthly 
at december   oreo was composed of one single family property located in northern virginia carried at a value of thousand  and two contiguous office buildings located in baltimore  maryland carried at a value of thousand 
each of the properties is being actively marketed in an effort to liquidate these assets 
deposits deposits totaled million at december  and were comprised of noninterest bearing demand deposits in the amount of million  savings and interest bearing deposits in the amount of million  and time deposits in the amount of million 
total deposits increased approximately million from december  noninterest bearing deposits increased million from million at december  to million at december  this increase in noninterest bearing accounts is due to a combination of new accounts and increased balances in existing commercial accounts at year end 
savings and interest bearing deposit accounts increased million from million at december  to million at december  time d eposits increased million and totaled million at december  compared to million in the increase in time deposits occurred primarily in cdars 
we use wholesale funding or brokered deposits to supplement traditional customer deposits for liquidity and to maintain our desired interest rate risk position 
together with fhlb borrowings we use brokered deposits to fund the short term cash needs associated with the lhfs activities discussed under loans as well as other funding needs 
brokered deposits totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  and include cdars deposits 
we participate in the certificate of deposit account registry service 
through cdars our depositors are able to obtain fdic insurance of up to million 
the fdic currently includes cdars deposits with brokered deposits even though the deposits originate from our customers 
these deposits are placed at other participating financial institutions to obtain fdic insurance and we receive a reciprocal amount in return from these financial institutions 
reciprocal cdars deposits were million and million at december  and  respectively  accounting for and of total brokered deposits 
we anticipate that this category of deposits will continue to expand in the future 
true brokered deposits have declined from million at december  to million at december  these deposits are not at premium rates and are frequently below retail interest rates 
brokered deposits are viewed by many as being volatile and unstable  however unlike retail certificates of deposit  there are no early withdrawal options on brokered certificates of deposit for any reason other than death of the underlying depositors 
brokered deposits provide funding flexibility and can be renewed at maturity  or allowed to roll off or increased or decreased without any impact on core deposit relationships 
we manage the roll over risk of all deposits by maintaining liquid assets in the form of interest bearing balances at the frb and fhlb as well as investment securities available for sale and loans held for sale 
in addition we also maintain lines of credit with the fhlb  frb  and correspondent banks 
at december  there was million available under these lines of credit 
depositors have been reluctant to extend maturities on certificates of deposits due to the low interest rate environment which has resulted in an increase in certificates of deposits maturing in the one year or less category 
we anticipate that we will renew these certificates of deposits depending on our current funding needs 
our funds management committee monitors the level of re pricing assets and liabilities and establishes pricing guidelines to maintain net interest margins

banking regulators have defined minimum regulatory capital ratios that the corporation and the bank are required to maintain 
these risk based capital guidelines take into consideration risk factors  as defined by the banking regulators  associated with various categories of assets  both on and off the balance sheet 
both the corporation and bank are classified as well capitalized  which is the highest rating

the liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
liquidity management involves maintaining the corporation s ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of both depositors and borrowers 
asset and liability management functions not only serve to assure adequate liquidity in order to meet the needs of the corporation s customers  but also to maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities so that the corporation can earn an appropriate return for its shareholders 
the asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through loan principal repayments and maturities of investment securities 
other short term investments such as federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with other banks are additional sources of liquidity funding 
at december   overnight interest bearing balances totaled million and securities available for sale totaled million 
the liability portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity through various interest bearing and noninterest bearing deposit accounts  federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreement to repurchase and other short term borrowings 
at december   the bank had a line of credit with the fhlb totaling million and million in term loans outstanding at fixed rates ranging from to leaving approximately million available on the line 
in addition to the line of credit at the fhlb  the bank and mortgage corporation issue repurchase agreements and commercial paper 
as of december   outstanding repurchase agreements totaled million and commercial paper issued amounted to million 
the interest rate on these instruments is variable and s ubject to change daily 
the bank also maintains federal funds lines of credit with its correspondent banks and  at december   these lines amounted to million 
the corporation also has million in subordinated debentures to support the corporation s operations 
the bank relies on deposits and other short and long term resources for liquidity from a variety of sources that substantially reduces reliance upon any single provider 
the corporation expects its short and long term sources of liquidity and capital to remain adequate to support expected growth 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the corporation s significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to make future payments as of december  payments due by period december  less than more than year years years total in thousands certificates of deposit fhlb advances securities sold under agreements to repurchase fhlb long term borrowings senior unsecured term note commercial paper us treasury demand notes subordinated debentures leases total the corporation generates sufficient cash flows and has adequate resources to meet its contractual obligations 
we anticipate that substantially all of the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed with the exception of certain brokered deposits that we intentionally will not be renewing 
we will be reducing borrowings by paying down the fhlb borrowings and us demand notes 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase and commercial paper are likely to remain substantially the same as these items represent funds from over night sweep agreements with our commercial checking customers 
off balance sheet items during the ordinary course of business  the bank issues commitments to extend credit and  at december   these commitments amounted to million 
these commitments do not necessarily represent cash requirements  since many commitments are expected to expire without being drawn on 
at december  the bank had approximately million in unfunded lines and letters of credit 
the mortgage corporation had open forward contracts at december  totaling million and million at december  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the mortgage corporation has agreements with a variety of counterparties to whom mortgage loans are sold on a non recourse basis 
as customary in the industry  the agreements require the mortgage corporation to extend representations and warranties with respect to program compliance  borrower misrepresentation  fraud  and early payment performance 
under the agreements  the counterparties are entitled to make loss claims and repurchase requests of the mortgage corporation for loans that contain covered deficiencies 
the overall economic conditions  rising unemployment  and weak values in the housing market has created a heightened risk of loss due to the representations and warranties associated with sold mortgage loans 
the mortgage corporation has adopted a reserve methodology whereby provisions are made to an expense account to fund a reserve maintained as a liability account on the balance sheet for potential losses 
the amount of the provision and adequacy of the reserve is recommended by management and approved by the board of the mortgage corporation no less than quarterly 
management estimates the reserve based upon an analysis of historical loss experiences and actual settlements with our counterparties 
a schedule of expected losses on loans with claims or indemnifications is maintained to ensure the reserve equals or exceeds the estimate of loss 
claims in process are recognized in the period received  actively monitored and subject to validation prior to payment 
often times  claims are not factually validated and the claim is rescinded 
once claims are validated and the actual or potential loss is agreed upon with the counterparty  the reserve is charged and a cash payment is made to settle the claim 
the loan performance data of sold loans is not made available to the mortgage co rporation by the counterparties  thereby making it impossible to estimate the timing and amount of claims until such time as claims are actually presented 
through careful monitoring and conservative estimates  the balance of the reserve has adequately provided for all claims since established 
at december  and the balance in this reserve totaled approximately million and million respectively 
during the fourth quarter of  the mortgage corporation reached settlement arrangements with its two largest mortgage investors wherein payments of million were made to these investors to release the mortgage corporation from known and unknown repurchase obligations associated with approximately billion of mortgage loans 
recent accounting pronouncements refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the corporation s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
the funds management committee is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position and establishes policies to monitor and coordinate the corporation s sources  uses  and pricing of funds 
interest rate sensitivity management the corporation uses a simulation model to analyze  manage and formulate operating strategies that address net interest income sensitivity to movements in interest rates 
the simulation model projects net interest income based on various interest rate scenarios over a twelve month period 
the model is based on the actual maturity and re pricing characteristics of rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the model incorporates certain assumptions which management believes to be reasonable regarding the impact of changing interest rates and the prepayment assumption of certain assets and liabilities as of december  the model assumes changes in interest rates without any management intervention to change the composition of the balance sheet 
according to the model run for the peri od ended december   over a twelve month period an immediate basis points increase in interest rates would result in an increase in net interest income by 
an immediate basis points increase in interest rates would result in an increase in net interest income by 
a basis points decrease in interest rates would result in a negative variance in net interest income and is considered unlikely given current interest rate levels 
while management carefully monitors the exposure to changes in interest rates and takes actions as warranted to decrease any adverse impact  there can be no assurance about the actual effect of interest rate changes on net interest income 
the corporation s net interest income and the fair value of its financial instruments are influenced by changes in the level of interest rates 
the corporation manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies established by its funds management committee 
the funds management committee meets monthly and has responsibility for formulating and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and earnings and reviewing interest rate sensitivity 
the mortgage corporation is party to mortgage rate lock commitments to fund mortgage loans at interest rates previously agreed locked by both the corporation and the borrower for specified periods of time 
when the borrower locks his or her interest rate  the corporation effectively extends a put option to the borrower  whereby the borrower is not obligated to enter into the loan agreement  but the corporation must honor the interest rate for the specified time period 
the corporation is exposed to interest rate risk during the accumulation of interest rate lock commitments and loans prior to sale 
the corporation utilizes either a best efforts sell forward or a mandatory sell forward commitment to economically hedge the changes in fair value of the loan due to changes in market interest rates 
failure to eff ectively monitor  manage  and hedge the interest rate risk associated with the mandatory commitments subjects the corporation to potentially significant market risk 
throughout the lock period the changes in the market value of interest rate lock commitments  best efforts and mandatory sell forward commitments are recorded as unrealized gains and losses and are included in the consolidated statement of income under other noninterest income 
the corporation utilizes a third party and its proprietary simulation model to assist in identifying and managing the risk associated with this activity 
impact of inflation and changing prices a bank s asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of a non financial company in that virtually all assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature 
the impact of inflation on financial results depends upon the bank s ability to react to changes in interest rates and  by such reaction  reduce the inflationary impact on performance 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction  or at the same magnitude  as the prices of other goods and services 
management seeks to manage the relationship between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation
