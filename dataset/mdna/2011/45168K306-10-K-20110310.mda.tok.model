item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are engaged in the discovery and development of dna and rna based drug candidates targeted to toll like receptors  or tlrs  to treat infectious diseases  autoimmune and inflammatory diseases  cancer  and respiratory diseases  and for use as vaccine adjuvants 
drug candidates are compounds that we are developing and that have not been approved for any commercial use 
tlrs are specific receptors present in immune system cells that recognize the dna or rna of bacteria or viruses and initiate an immune response 
relying on our expertise in dna and rna chemistry  we have designed and created proprietary tlr agonists and antagonists to modulate immune responses 
a tlr agonist is a compound that stimulates an immune response through the targeted tlr 
a tlr antagonist is a compound that blocks activation of an immune response through the targeted tlr 
our business strategy is to advance applications of our tlr targeted drug candidates in multiple disease areas simultaneously 
we are advancing some of these applications through internal programs  and we seek to advance 
table of contents other applications through collaborative alliances with pharmaceutical companies 
collaborators provide the necessary resources and drug development experience to advance our compounds in their programs 
upfront payments and milestone payments received from collaborations help to provide us with the financial resources for our internal research and development programs 
our internal programs are focused on developing tlr targeted drug candidates for the potential treatment of infectious diseases  autoimmune and inflammatory diseases  cancer  and respiratory diseases  and for use as vaccine adjuvants 
we have completed two phase clinical trials of imo  a tlr agonist  in patients with chronic hepatitis c virus  or hcv  infection and intend to initiate enrollment in a week phase randomized clinical trial of imo plus ribavirin in treatment na ve hcv patients in the second quarter of we have completed two phase clinical trials of imo  an antagonist of tlr and tlr  in healthy subjects and we expect to complete ongoing nonclinical studies of imo during the first half of and intend to submit to the fda a protocol for a phase clinical trial of imo in a selected disease indication during the third quarter of in addition to our internal programs  we currently are collaborating with two pharmaceutical companies to advance other applications of our tlr targeted compounds 
we are collaborating with merck kgaa for the use of tlr agonists in cancer treatment  excluding cancer vaccines 
merck kgaa is conducting one phase clinical trial and three phase b clinical trials of imo  which merck kgaa refers to as emd  in combination with other cancer therapy agents in several cancer indications 
we also are collaborating with merck sharpe dohme corp  or merck  for the use of tlr  tlr  and tlr agonists as vaccine adjuvants in the fields of cancer  infectious diseases  and alzheimer s disease 
merck kgaa and merck are not related 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur substantial operating losses in future periods 
we do not expect to generate significant funds or product revenue until we successfully complete development and obtain marketing approval for drug candidates  either alone or in collaborations with third parties  which we expect will take a number of years 
in order to commercialize our drug candidates  we need to address a number of technological challenges and to comply with comprehensive regulatory requirements 
critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition and stock based compensation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we regard an accounting estimate or assumption underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate where the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
not all of these significant policies  however  fit the definition of critical accounting policies and estimates 
we believe that our accounting policies relating to revenue recognition and stock based compensation fit the description of critical accounting estimates and judgments 

table of contents revenue recognition our corporate strategy includes entering into collaborative license and development agreements with pharmaceutical companies for the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
the terms of our agreements have included non refundable license fees  funding of research and development  payments based upon achievement of clinical and preclinical development milestones and royalties on product sales 
our policy for recognizing revenue requires that four basic criteria are met before we can recognize revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  services have been rendered or obligations have been satisfied  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
determination of the last three criteria are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered or products delivered and the collectability of these fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for any future transactions  revenues recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
when evaluating multiple element arrangements  we consider whether the components of the arrangement represent separate units of accounting 
we recognize revenue from non refundable upfront fees received under collaboration agreements  not specifically tied to a separate earnings process  ratably over the term of our contractual obligation or our estimated continuing involvement under the research arrangement 
if the estimated period of continuing involvement is subsequently modified  we will modify the period over which the upfront fee is recognized  accordingly  on a prospective basis 
we recognize revenue from reimbursements earned in connection with our research and development collaboration agreements as related research and development costs are incurred  and our contractual services are performed  provided collectability is reasonably assured 
we include amounts contractually owed us under these research and development collaboration agreements  including any earned but unbilled receivables  in trade accounts receivable in our balance sheets 
our principal costs under these agreements are generally for our personnel and related expenses of conducting research and development  as well as for research and development performed by outside contractors or consultants or related research and development materials provided by third parties or for clinical trials we conduct on behalf of a collaborator 
for payments that are specifically associated with a separate earnings process  we recognize revenue when the specific performance obligation is completed 
performance obligations typically consist of significant milestones in the development life cycle of the related technology  such as initiating clinical trials  filing for approval with regulatory agencies and obtaining approvals from regulatory agencies 
we recognize revenue from milestone payments received under collaboration agreements when earned  provided that the milestone event is substantive  its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  we have no further performance obligations relating to the event and collectability is reasonably assured 
in the event that the agreement provides for payment to be made subsequent to our standard payment terms  we recognize revenue when payment becomes due 
amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in our balance sheets 
we classify amounts that we expect to recognize in the next twelve months as short term deferred revenue 
we classify amounts that we do not expect to recognize within the next twelve months as long term deferred revenue 
although we follow detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
for example  in connection with our existing collaboration agreements  we classify any deferred revenue recorded on our balance sheets as short term and long term deferred revenue based on our best estimate of when such revenue will be recognized 
however  these estimates are based on our collaboration agreements and our 
table of contents then current operating plan and  if either should change  we may recognize a different amount of deferred revenue over the subsequent twelve month period 
our estimates of deferred revenue also reflect management s estimate of the periods of our involvement in our collaborations and the estimated periods over which our performance obligations will be completed 
in some instances  the timing of satisfying these obligations can be difficult to estimate 
accordingly  our estimates may change in subsequent periods 
such changes to estimates would result in a change in revenue recognition amounts 
if these estimates and judgments change over the course of these agreements  it may affect the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize and record in subsequent periods 
stock based compensation we recognize all share based payments to employees as expense in our financial statements based on their fair values 
we record compensation expense over an award s vesting period based on the award s fair value at the date of grant 
our policy is to charge the fair value of stock options as an expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
we are also required to record compensation cost for the non vested portion of stock based awards granted prior to january   when we adopted accounting standards codification  or asc  stock compensation  over the requisite service periods for the individual awards based on the estimated fair value adjusted for forfeitures 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants 
the black scholes model relies on a number of key assumptions to calculate estimated fair values  including assumptions as to average risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield  expected life and expected volatility 
for the assumed risk free interest rate  we use the us treasury security rate with a term equal to the expected life of the option 
our assumed dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends to common stockholders and have no present intention to pay cash dividends 
for options granted during and  we use an expected option life based on the average of the option term and the option vesting period for standard options and based on actual experience of options held by employees holding options with similar characteristics for those options that do not meet the criteria for using the simplified method 
for options granted after december   we use an expected option life based on actual experience 
our assumption for expected volatility is based on the actual stock price volatility over a period equal to the expected life of the option 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the stock based compensation expense we recognize in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income loss  net income loss and earnings loss per share 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
these characteristics are not present in our option grants 
although the black scholes option pricing model is widely used  existing valuation models  including the black scholes valuation model  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
we included charges of   and  in our statements of operations for the years ended december   and  respectively  representing the stock compensation expense attributable to share based payments made to employees and directors 
the increase in stock compensation expense for  as compared to  was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year s amortization of the  fair value of options to purchase an aggregate of  shares granted in december in the period as compared to the period which reflected less than one month s amortization of those options 
the modification of stock options during in connection with the adoption of policies on the treatment of options in connection with director or employee retirement also contributed to the increase in stock compensation expense during the options to purchase an aggregate of  shares granted in december did not impact our expense significantly but the amortization of the  fair value of the options will impact our expense 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued accounting standard update no 
 multiple element revenue arrangements asu no 
 which updates the existing multiple element revenue arrangements guidance currently included in accounting standards codification no 
in two ways 
the first change relates to the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting 
this is significant as it will likely result in the requirement to separate more deliverables within an arrangement  ultimately leading to less revenue deferral 
the second change modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables 
asu no 
also significantly expands the disclosures required for multiple element revenue arrangements 
asu no 
will be effective for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after june   and may be applied retrospectively for all periods presented or prospectively to arrangements entered into or materially modified after the adoption date 
since our period of continuing involvement in the research portions of our current collaboration agreements was completed during and since all of the up front payments received under these collaborations have been fully amortized as of december   asu no 
will have no effect on our financial position and results of operations through december  we will evaluate the effect that asu no 
may have on our policy for recognizing revenue under any future collaboration agreements 
in april  the fasb issued accounting standard update no 
 milestone method of revenue recognition asu no 
 which provides guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research or development transactions 
prior to the issuance of asu no 
 authoritative guidance on the use of the milestone method did not exist 
asu no 
is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after june  with early adoption permitted 
alternatively  asu no 
can be adopted retrospectively for all prior periods 
since we have not elected early adoption and we do not intend to elect retrospective adoption  asu no 
will have no effect on our financial position and results of operations through december  we will evaluate the effect that asu no 
may have on our policy for recognizing revenue on any milestones that we receive in future periods 
results of operations years ended december   and alliance revenue our alliance revenues are comprised primarily of revenue earned under various collaboration and licensing agreements which include license fees  research and development revenues  including reimbursement of internal and third party expenses  milestones and patent related reimbursements 
the following table is a summary of our alliance revenue earned under our collaboration and licensing agreements year ended december  annual percentage change in millions license fees research and development milestones other total alliance revenue license fees 
license fees primarily include license fee revenue recognized under our collaborations with merck kgaa  merck and novartis 
license fee revenue during  and was comprised of amortization of the upfront license fee payments and  if applicable  any research period extension payments we recognized from 
table of contents collaborative alliances  with which we were still involved during the period 
we recognize license fee revenue ratably over the expected period of our continuing involvement in the collaborations  which generally represents the estimated research period of the agreement 
since we have completed the research portion of our current collaborations  all of the upfront license fee payments have been amortized to revenue 
as a result  we do not expect to recognize any additional license fee revenue under these collaborations 
the following table is a summary of license fees recognized under our three principal collaborations year ended december  collaborator in millions merck kgaa merck novartis we received a million upfront payment from merck kgaa in euros in february of which we received million due to foreign currency exchange rates in effect at the time 
we recognized the million upfront payment as revenue over the twenty eight month research term that ended in june we received a million upfront payment from merck in december we recognized the million upfront payment as revenue over the two year initial research term and the two year extension period that ended in december we received a million upfront payment from novartis in july and an additional million payment in may to extend the research portion of the agreement 
the amount of license fee revenue we recognized under our may research collaboration with novartis decreased in because we completed our research obligations in the amount of license fee revenue that we recognized under our merck kgaa collaboration increased in from reflecting a full year of involvement 
the amount of license fee revenue that we recognized under merck kgaa and merck decreased in as we completed our research obligations under these agreements 
research and development 
research and development revenue decreased by million in as a result of decreased reimbursement of costs for the phase b clinical trials of imo and the phase clinical trial of imo in healthy subjects  merck assumed sponsorship of both of these trials by march research and development revenue increased by million in compared to due to the reimbursement in of clinical trial costs associated with the three clinical trials that we conducted under our collaboration agreement with merck kgaa 
this increase was offset by a decrease in revenue from research reimbursements under our collaboration with merck as we had fewer employee expenses that were reimbursed under our collaboration with merck 
we do not expect to record significant research and development revenue under either the merck kgaa or merck collaborations in milestones 
milestone revenue decreased in  as compared to  and increased in  as compared to  reflecting primarily the timing of recognition of milestone payments received under our collaboration with merck kgaa 
we recognized milestone revenue of million in as a result of the milestone earned in connection with the initiation by merck kgaa of a phase b clinical trial of emd merck kgaa s reference for imo in first line treatment of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck 
the milestone payments of million recognized in resulted from the initiation of a phase b clinical trial of emd in patients with colorectal cancer and the initiation by merck kgaa of a phase clinical trial of imo in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck 
our milestone revenue was attributable to million earned under our collaboration with novartis relating to the initiation of a phase clinical trial of qax by novartis and million earned under our collaboration with merck relating to a preclinical milestone achieved by merck with one of our novel tlr agonists used as an adjuvant in a cancer vaccine under preclinical study 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in and increased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in the increase in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to increased clinical trial  manufacturing and nonclinical safety study costs associated with imo and imo 
table of contents the increase in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to increased imo clinical trial expenses associated with the three clinical trials that we conducted under our merck kgaa agreement  which expenses were reimbursed by merck kgaa  increased nonclinical safety studies and manufacturing of imo in preparation for imo clinical trials  and increased discovery research expenses 
these increases were offset  in part  by a decrease in nonclinical safety studies and manufacturing of imo year ended december  annual percentage change in millions imo external development expense imo external development expense imo external development expense other drug development expense basic discovery expense in the preceding table  research and development expense is set forth in the following five categories imo external development expenses 
these expenses include external expenses that we have incurred in connection with imo these external expenses include payments to independent contractors and vendors for drug development activities conducted after the initiation of imo clinical development but exclude internal costs such as payroll and overhead expenses 
we commenced clinical development of imo in may and since then we have incurred approximately million in external development expenses through december   including costs associated with our phase clinical trials and related nonclinical studies and manufacturing and related process development 
external development expenses for imo increased by million  or  from million in to million in the increase in imo expenses in compared to was primarily due to increased expenses resulting from the progression of our phase clinical trial in null responder hcv patients  which we initiated in september  the initiation and progression of our phase clinical trial in treatment naive hcv patients  which we initiated in october  manufacture of additional supplies of imo in  conduct of additional nonclinical safety studies of imo  and million associated with the preparation for a phase clinical trial in non responder hcv patients which we subsequently determined not to conduct as we instead plan to conduct a phase clinical trial in treatment na ve hcv patients 
external development expenses for imo decreased by million  or  from million in to million in the decrease in imo expenses in compared to was primarily attributable to higher manufacturing costs in associated with producing imo in anticipation of our phase i clinical trials and a decrease in costs for nonclinical safety studies of imo  which decreased because a lower level of nonclinical safety and manufacturing activity was required to support the clinical trials ongoing during this decrease was partially offset by an increase in costs related to our phase clinical trial to assess the safety of imo in combination with ribavirin in treatment na ve hcv patients  which we initiated in october in may  we submitted an investigational new drug  or ind  application for imo to the united states food and drug administration  or fda 
in september  we initiated a phase clinical trial of imo in patients with genotype chronic hcv infection who had no response to a prior regimen of the current standard of care therapy specified by the protocol as patients who failed to achieve a log 
reduction in hcv viral load after at least weeks of treatment with the current standard of care therapy 
hcv viral load refers to the concentration of virus in the blood 
a log 
reduction means a decrease in virus concentration to of the original concentration 
a log 
reduction means a decrease to of the original concentration 
we refer to these patients as null responder hcv patients 
the clinical trial was conducted at a total of eleven sites in the united states with a total of patients 
in the trial  we enrolled cohorts of ten patients at escalating imo dose levels of mg kg week  mg kg week  mg kg week  mg kg week  and mg kg week 
of the ten patients in a cohort  eight were randomized to receive imo treatment and 
table of contents two were randomized to receive placebo treatment 
patients received a single dose of imo or placebo once per week by subcutaneous injection for four weeks 
based on interim results from these cohorts  we enrolled seven additional patients who received mg kg of imo twice weekly for four weeks 
the primary objective of the trial was to assess the safety of imo at each dose level 
we also evaluated the effects of imo on hcv rna levels and on immune system activation in this trial 
we presented results from the phase clinical trial of imo in null responder hcv patients at scientific meetings in april and in october we also conducted a phase clinical trial of imo in combination with ribavirin  an antiviral medication approved for use in combination with interferon alpha in the treatment of hcv infection  in treatment na ve patients with genotype chronic hcv infection 
we initiated the trial in october in this clinical trial  a total of patients received imo or a control article by subcutaneous injection once per week for four weeks at escalating dose levels in combination with daily oral administration of standard doses of ribavirin 
fifteen patients were enrolled in the first cohort  with randomized to receive imo at mg kg week and ribavirin and three randomized to receive placebo and ribavirin as the control 
eighteen patients were enrolled in the second cohort  with randomized to receive imo at mg kg week and ribavirin and six randomized to receive pegylated recombinant alfa a interferon and ribavirin as the control 
the third cohort enrolled patients randomized to receive imo at mg kg week  imo at mg kg twice per week  or pegylated recombinant alfa a interferon  respectively  all with ribavirin 
the primary objective of the trial was to assess the safety and tolerability of imo in combination with ribavirin 
in addition  we monitored the effect of treatment on hcv rna levels 
the clinical trial was conducted at sites in france  russia  and hungary 
in december  we announced preliminary data from the phase clinical trial of imo in treatment na ve hcv patients 
we are planning a week phase clinical trial of imo plus ribavirin with a control arm of pegylated recombinant alfa a interferon plus ribavirin in approximately treatment na ve hcv patients 
our objectives of the phase clinical trial will be to determine optimal dosing  provide longer term safety data  and generate additional antiviral activity data 
we intend to initiate enrollment in the phase clinical trial in the second quarter of we intend for the trial to provide the basis for subsequent clinical development of imo as an alternative to recombinant interferon in combination therapy with direct acting antiviral agents 
imo external development expenses 
these expenses include external expenses that we have incurred in connection with imo since november  when we commenced clinical development of imo these external expenses include payments to independent contractors and vendors for drug development activities conducted after the initiation of imo clinical development but exclude internal costs such as payroll and overhead expenses 
since november  we have incurred approximately million in external development expenses through december   including costs associated with the single dose phase clinical trial in healthy subjects we initiated in january and the multiple dose phase clinical trial in healthy subjects we initiated in july  manufacturing and process development activities related to the production of imo  and conduct of additional nonclinical safety studies 
external development expenses for imo increased by million  or  from million in to million in the increase in imo expenses in compared to was primarily due to expenses associated with our single dose phase clinical trial  which we initiated in january  and with our multiple dose phase clinical trial  which we initiated in july  nonclinical safety studies  the manufacture of additional supplies of imo in  and million associated with the cancellation of two previously planned nonclinical chronic toxicology studies 
in november  we submitted to the fda an ind application for the clinical evaluation of imo in autoimmune diseases 
in january  we initiated a phase clinical trial of imo in healthy subjects 
in this single dose  dose escalation phase trial  imo was administered by subcutaneous injection at dose levels of     and mg kg to a total of subjects 
at each dose level  six subjects received imo an additional six subjects received placebo treatment 
the primary objective of the trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of imo secondary objectives were to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of imo and to assess the pharmacodynamic mechanism of action of imo the pharmacodynamic mechanism of action is how imo engages the immune system in the targeted manner  which we assessed through 
table of contents measurement of the inhibition of tlr and tlr mediated cytokine induction in peripheral blood mononuculear cells  or pbmcs 
the trial was conducted at a single us site 
in october we announced results from the single dose phase clinical trial of imo imo was well tolerated at all dose levels in the trial 
we have also conducted a four week multiple dose phase clinical trial of imo in healthy subjects that we initiated in july and completed in the third quarter of we intend to present results of the multi dose phase clinical trial at a scientific meeting in the second quarter of we intend for the next step in the clinical development of imo to be a phase clinical trial in a selected autoimmune disease indication 
we are currently conducting nonclinical studies of imo  in light of some reversible immune responses that were observed in the week nonclinical toxicology studies we had conducted to support the initiation of phase clinical trials and that were inconsistent with observations in our other nonclinical studies of imo we expect to complete these nonclinical studies during the first half of and intend to submit to the fda the results of these nonclinical studies and a protocol for a phase clinical trial of imo in a selected autoimmune disease indication during the third quarter of imo external development expenses 
imo is being developed for cancer  excluding vaccines  under our collaboration with merck kgaa 
merck kgaa refers to imo as emd external development expenses include payments to independent contractors and vendors for drug development activities conducted after the initiation of imo clinical development but exclude internal costs such as payroll and overhead expenses 
since  when we commenced clinical development of imo and through december   we have incurred approximately million in external expenses in connection with imo under our collaboration  merck kgaa is responsible for developing emd for the treatment of cancer excluding vaccines 
prior to march  we conducted clinical trials of emd under the collaboration and merck kgaa reimbursed us 
as of september  merck kgaa assumed sponsorship of the emd phase b clinical trials 
as of march  merck kgaa assumed sponsorship of the one remaining ongoing clinical trial of emd for the treatment of cancer and responsibility for all further clinical development of emd in the treatment of cancer  excluding vaccines 
as a result of merck kgaa s assumption of sponsorship of the trials  we did not incur significant expenses for emd development in  and do not expect to incur significant emd development expense in or thereafter 
emd external development expenses decreased by million  or  in  as compared to  as a result of merck kgaa assuming sponsorship of the trials in september and in march emd external development expenses increased by million  or  from million in to million in the increase from to was primarily attributable to increases in costs  which costs are reimbursed by merck kgaa  associated with our phase b clinical trials of emd in patients with non small cell lung cancer  which we initiated in december  and emd in patients with colorectal cancer  for which we commenced dosing in january  and our phase clinical trial in healthy subjects that we initiated in april this increase was offset  in part  by a decrease in emd expenses associated with our phase stage a clinical trial in patients with metastatic or recurrent clear cell renal cancer which we completed in the second quarter of approximately million and million of expenses in and  respectively  were reimbursed by merck kgaa 
additional imo external development expenses were incurred for specified projects initiated prior to the effective date of the collaboration during other drug development expenses 
these expenses include external expenses associated with preclinical development of identified compounds in anticipation of advancing these compounds into clinical development 
in addition  these expenses include internal costs  such as payroll and overhead expenses  associated with preclinical development and products in clinical development 
the external expenses associated with preclinical compounds include payments to contract vendors for manufacturing and the related stability studies  preclinical studies  including animal toxicology and pharmacology studies  and professional fees 
expenses associated with products in clinical development include costs associated with our hepatitis c clinical advisory board and our autoimmune disease scientific advisory board 

table of contents the decrease in other drug development expenses in compared to  was primarily due to the inclusion of imo expenses incurred after the commencement of clinical development in november in the imo external development expense category shown separately above 
prior to november  nonclinical safety and pharmacology study expenses related to imo and costs to manufacture imo were included in the other drug development expenses category 
the increase in from was primarily due to increases in manufacturing and other pre ind direct external expenses  including nonclinical safety studies  related to imo that we incurred through november when we submitted the ind for imo to the fda 
basic discovery expenses 
these expenses include our internal and external expenses relating to the discovery of our tlr targeted programs  including agonists and antagonists of tlrs   and  and tlr antisense 
these expenses reflect payments for laboratory supplies  external research  and professional fees  as well as payroll and overhead expenses 
the increase in basic discovery expenses in from is primarily attributable to higher employee expenses  including higher stock compensation expense associated with stock options granted after september  and the addition of a vice president of biology to our discovery staff in july  and higher allocated facilities costs  offset by a decrease in research supplies related to decreased research conducted under our collaboration agreements and lower external nonclinical research costs 
the increase in as compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in laboratory supply costs and allocated facility costs and higher stock based compensation for employees 
we do not know if we will be successful in developing any drug candidate from our research and development programs 
at this time  without knowing the results of our ongoing clinical trials and without an established plan for future clinical tests of drug candidates  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing  and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of  or the period  if any  in which material net cash inflows may commence from  any drug candidate from our research and development programs 
moreover  the clinical development of any drug candidate from our research and development programs is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the duration and cost of clinical trials  which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of unanticipated events arising during clinical development 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in and decreased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary expense  stock compensation expense  consulting fees and professional legal fees associated  in part  with our patent applications and maintenance  our regulatory filing requirements  and business development 
the million increase from to was primarily due to higher stock compensation expense primarily resulting from stock options granted after september  and the modification of stock options during  higher employee expenses  higher legal fees related to patent maintenance and corporate matters  and increased consulting fees associated with business and strategic initiatives  offset  in part  by a decrease in allocated facilities costs 
the million decrease from to was primarily due to lower consulting fees and lower external patent expenses and stock based compensation for consultants in this decrease was offset by increased employee costs in this area  including higher stock based compensation expense for employees 
investment income  net investment income amounted to million in and  and decreased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in the decrease from to is primarily attributable to lower interest rates on our money market funds  lower yields on our investments  and lower average funds earning interest during 
table of contents interest expense interest expense was negligible in and interest expense in reflected interest through our march repayment in full of our note payable to general electric capital corporation  or ge  and a prepayment premium associated with the note repayment 
as a result of our repayment  the note was cancelled 
income tax expense in  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately  which was primarily related to the carry back of net operating losses to recover alternative minimum tax as a result of the enactment of the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of during  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately  which was primarily related to refundable research and experimental tax credits 
foreign currency exchange loss foreign currency exchange loss was million in  negligible in and million in foreign currency exchange gains and losses may result from amounts received under our merck kgaa collaboration agreement and payments under our clinical trial agreements that are denominated in euros 
in  we earned a milestone  denominated in euros  under our merck kgaa collaboration  for which we had a million receivable at december  merck kgaa paid us for this milestone in february and we received million based on foreign exchange rates in effect at the time of payment as a result of the strengthening value of the us dollar 
in the third quarter of  we earned a million milestone  denominated in euros  under our merck kgaa collaboration for which we received million based on foreign exchange rates in effect at the time of payment as a result of the weakening value of the us dollar 
the remaining million foreign currency exchange loss in is attributable to the foreign exchange rates in effect at the time of payments made under our clinical trial agreements that are denominated in euros 
in february  merck kgaa paid us a million upfront license fee denominated in euros 
we received million us dollars due to foreign currency exchange rates in effect at the time we received the payment as a result of the strengthening value of the us dollar  which resulted in the foreign currency exchange loss 
net loss income as a result of the factors discussed above  we had a net loss of million for the year ended december  we had net income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we have incurred losses of million since january  we incurred net losses of million prior to december  during which time we were involved in the development of antisense technology 
since our inception  we had an accumulated deficit of million through december  we may incur substantial operating losses in future periods 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   we had cumulative net operating loss carryforwards  or nols  of approximately million and million available to reduce federal and state taxable income which expire through in addition  we had cumulative federal and state tax credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively  available to reduce federal and state income taxes  which expire through and  respectively 
the tax reform act of contains provisions  which limit the amount of nols and credit carryforwards that companies may utilize in any one year in the event of cumulative changes in ownership over a three year period in excess of 
we have completed several financings since the effective date of the tax reform act of  which as of december   have resulted in ownership changes in excess of and that will significantly limit our ability to utilize our nol and tax credit carryforwards 
ownership changes in future periods may place additional limits on our ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity we require cash to fund our operating expenses  to make capital expenditures and to pay debt service 
historically  we have funded our cash requirements primarily through the following equity and debt financing  license fees  research funding and milestone payments under collaborative and license agreements  interest income  and lease financings

funding requirements we have incurred operating losses in all fiscal years except  and  and we had an accumulated deficit of million at december  we expect to incur substantial operating losses in future periods 
these losses  among other things  have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders equity  total assets and working capital 
we have received no revenues from the sale of drugs 
to date  almost all of our revenues have been from collaboration and license agreements 
we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development  including clinical trials  and we have not completed development of any drugs 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses  whether or when any of our products will become commercially available  or when we will become profitable  if at all 
we do not expect to generate significant additional funds internally until we successfully complete development and obtain marketing approval for products  either alone or in collaboration with third parties  which we expect will take a number of years 
in addition  we have no committed external sources of funds 
we had cash  cash equivalents  and investments of million at december  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  and investments will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through march  based on our current operating plan  including a phase clinical trial of imo in hcv patients for which we intend to initiate enrollment in the second quarter of and nonclinical studies to support the initiation of a phase clinical trial of imo in an initial autoimmune disease indication during this period 
we expect to need to raise additional funds to operate our business beyond march  we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans 
we expect to seek additional funding through collaborations  the sale or license of assets or financings of equity or debt securities 
we believe that the key factors that will affect our ability to obtain additional funding are the success of our clinical and preclinical development programs  the success of our existing strategic collaborations with merck kgaa and merck  
table of contents the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  competitive and potentially competitive products and technologies and investors receptivity to our drug candidates and the technology underlying them in light of competitive products and technologies  the receptivity of the capital markets to financings by biotechnology companies generally and companies with drug candidates and technologies such as ours specifically  and our ability to enter into new strategic collaborations with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and the success of such collaborations 
in addition  increases in expenses or delays in clinical development may adversely impact our cash position and require additional funds or further cost reductions 
additional financing may not be available to us when we need it or may not be available to us on favorable terms 
we could be required to seek funds through collaborative alliances or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies  drug candidates or drugs that we would otherwise pursue on our own 
in addition  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our then existing stockholders will experience dilution 
debt financing  if available  may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions  such as incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures or declaring dividends  and are likely to include rights that are senior to the holders of our common stock 
any additional debt financing or equity that we raise may contain terms  such as liquidation and other preferences  or liens or other restrictions on our assets  which are not favorable to us or our stockholders 
the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of existing stockholders 
if we are unable to obtain adequate funding on a timely basis or at all  we may be required to significantly curtail one or more of our discovery or development programs and possibly relinquish rights to portions of our technology or products

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange gains and losses may result from amounts received under our merck kgaa collaboration agreement and payments under our clinical trial agreements that are denominated in euros

all other assets and liabilities are in us dollars  which is our functional currency 
we maintain investments in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment
