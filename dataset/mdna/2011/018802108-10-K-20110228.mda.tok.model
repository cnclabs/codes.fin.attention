environmental matters overview alliant energy  ipl and wpl are subject to regulation of environmental matters by federal  state and local authorities as a result of their current and past operations 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl monitor these environmental matters and address them with pollution abatement programs 
these programs are subject to continuing review and are periodically revised due to various factors  including changes in environmental regulations  litigation of environmental requirements  construction plans and compliance costs 
there is currently significant regulatory uncertainty with respect to the various environmental rules and regulations discussed below 
given the dynamic nature of environmental regulations and other related regulatory requirements  alliant energy  ipl and wpl have established an integrated planning process that is used for environmental compliance for their operations 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl anticipate future expenditures for environmental compliance will be material  including significant capital investments 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl anticipate that prudent expenditures incurred by ipl and wpl to comply with environmental requirements likely would be recovered in rates from their customers 
refer to strategic overview environmental compliance plans for details of alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s environmental compliance plans  including estimated capital expenditures 
the following are major environmental matters that could potentially have a significant impact on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s financial condition and results of operations 
air quality the caa and its amendments mandate preservation of air quality through existing regulations and periodic reviews to ensure adequacy of these provisions based on scientific data 
as part of the basic framework under the caa  the epa is required to establish naaqs  which serve to protect public health and welfare 
these standards address six criteria pollutants  four of which are particularly relevant to alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s electric utility operations  including nox  so  particulate matter pm  and ozone 
ozone is not directly emitted from alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s generating facilities  however  nox emissions may contribute to its formation in the atmosphere 
fine particulate matter pm may also be formed in the atmosphere from so and nox emissions 
state implementation plans sips document the collection of regulations that individual state agencies will apply to maintain naaqs and related caa requirements 
the epa must approve each sip and if a sip is not acceptable to the epa or if a state chooses not to issue separate state rules  then the epa can assume enforcement of the caa in that state by issuing a federal implementation plan fip 
areas that comply with naaqs are considered to be in attainment  whereas routinely monitored locations that do not comply with these standards may be classified by the epa as non attainment and require further actions to reduce emissions 
additional emissions standards may also be applied under the caa regulatory framework beyond naaqs 
the specific federal and state air quality regulations that may affect alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s operations include cair  catr  clean air visibility rule cavr  utility mact rule  wisconsin state mercury rule  wisconsin ract rule  industrial boiler and process heater mact rule and naaqs rules 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl also monitor various other potential environmental matters related to air quality  including litigation of various federal rules issued under the caa statutory authority  revisions to the new source review psd permitting programs and nsps

in the interim  cair obligations became effective for nox on jan 
 and so on jan 
 and remain in place until the epa issues a final cair replacement rule 
catr in july  the epa issued its proposed cair replacement rule  referred to as the catr 
the catr would require so and nox emissions reductions from emission sources located in states in the eastern half of the us as well as the district of columbia 
the catr would affect ipl s and wpl s fossil fueled egus with greater than mw of capacity located in iowa  minnesota and wisconsin 
existing cair compliance requirements remain effective until the final catr compliance requirements supersede them  which the epa currently estimates will occur in beginning in  the catr would establish state emission caps for so and nox phase i 
these so emission caps would be lowered further in for iowa and wisconsin  but not minnesota phase ii 
while the nox emission caps are not lowered further in the catr  the epa indicates that it will likely lower these caps in the final version of the catr or subsequent rulemakings 

table of contents in the catr  the epa identifies one preferred and two alternative approaches 
all three approaches establish state emission caps  however  they allow varying degrees of limited  if any  emissions trading to meet compliance requirements 
in addition  the emission allowances used for acid rain and cair program compliance cannot be used for compliance with the catr 
refer to note b of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of ipl s forward contracts to purchase so emission allowances  which may be impacted by catr 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl continue to implement their environmental compliance plans to meet the currently effective cair requirements  which include investments in emission controls for egus as well as use of emission allowances 
the final catr is expected to be issued by the epa in mid alliant energy  ipl and wpl will monitor future developments relating to the catr and update their environmental compliance plans as needed 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict the final outcome of the epa s catr as a replacement rule for cair  but expect that capital investments and or modifications to meet compliance requirements of the rule could be significant 
cavr cavr requires states to develop and implement sips to address visibility impairment in designated national parks and wilderness areas across the country with a national goal of no impairment by proposed cavr sips for iowa  wisconsin and minnesota have been submitted to the epa for review and approval 
these sips include best available retrofit technology rule bart emission controls and other additional measures needed for reducing state contributions to regional haze 
the epa has not issued responses on these cavr sips 
if a cavr sip is found to be deficient  then the epa is required to promulgate a cavr fip to address these requirements in the interim until the cavr sip is approved 
the cavr sips will determine required compliance actions and deadlines 
there are uncertainties in the applicability of and compliance outcomes of bart control approaches that will be approved by the epa for inclusion in cavr sips 
egu emissions of primary concern for bart and regional haze regulation include so  nox and pm 
there are pending obligations under the epa s cavr to complete bart determinations that would evaluate control options to reduce these emissions at certain wpl and ipl egus that were built between and the dc circuit court remand of cair to the epa in may have an indirect impact on the cavr and bart sip implementation approach because the epa allowed bart obligations for so and nox emissions to be fulfilled by cair 
the proposed catr does not address the epa s prior decision related to cair being sufficient to meet compliance obligations for units subject to bart emissions reduction requirements for so and nox under the cavr often referred to as cair equals bart 
the epa s revised assessment of the relationship for the cavr s bart requirements and the proposed catr remains pending  including whether the epa s compliance approach and final rule will allow for catr equals bart for so and nox 
in addition  there are uncertainties whether additional emission reductions could be required to address regional haze impacts beyond bart 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are unable to predict the impact that cavr might have on the operations of their existing egus until the epa final approval of state cavr plans  which is currently expected in utility mact rule in  the epa announced its intention to develop mact rules for egus pursuant to section of the caa 
when developing a mact rule  the epa looks at the current level of emissions control achieved by best performing similar sources 
these emissions control levels set a baseline  often referred to as the mact floor  used in determination of the performance standards required under the new rule 
each regulated egu must demonstrate performance with the standards adopted in the final rule 
the caa requirements of section state that these standards become effective upon promulgation of the final rule and that compliance is required no later than three years after the effective date of the standards 
in january  the epa issued an information collection request for coal and oil fired egus over mw in order to develop a proposed utility mact rule for the control of mercury and other federal haps 
the purpose of the proposed information collection request was to collect data necessary to identify affected categories of egus that will be subject to a utility mact rule and to define the mact floor 
in february  the epa entered into a consent decree that requires the agency to propose utility mact rules for coal and oil fired egus no later than march and promulgate final rules no later than november based upon the timeline set forth in the consent decree  compliance with the utility mact rule is expected to be required by november alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict the final outcome of a utility mact rule to regulate mercury and other federal haps from egus  but expect that capital investments and or modifications could be significant to comply with any such regulations 
wisconsin state mercury rule the wisconsin state mercury rule requires electric utility companies in wisconsin to meet compliance requirements to reduce annual mercury emissions by from a historic baseline beginning in phase i 
in addition  the wisconsin state mercury rule requires large coal fired egus with greater than mw of capacity to either achieve a annual mercury emissions reduction standard or limit the annual concentration of mercury emissions to pounds of mercury per gigawatt hour beginning in phase ii 
small coal fired egus between mw and mw of capacity must install best available control technology bact by january to reduce mercury emissions 
as an alternative  this rule allows large and small egus to achieve compliance through averaging 
there is also an alternative multi pollutant option that extends the time for compliance with the annual mercury reduction requirement until 
table of contents however  this requires the affected facilities to achieve nox and so reductions beyond those currently required by federal and state regulations 
in december  wpl filed its compliance plan with the wisconsin department of natural resources dnr 
wpl s plan states that it will utilize large and small egu averaging to comply with the additional mercury rule emissions reduction requirements that commence in and not use the multi pollutant option 
alliant energy and wpl continue to evaluate the impact of this state mercury rule and the federal utility mact rule discussed above to determine further mercury emission reductions that will be required 
refer to strategic overview environmental compliance plans wpl s emission control projects for discussion of proposed wpl emission controls that support compliance with the requirements of this rule 
wisconsin ract rule in  the epa designated counties in southeastern wisconsin as non attainment areas for the ozone naaqs 
this designation includes sheboygan county  where wpl operates the sheboygan falls energy facility and edgewater 
in  the wisconsin dnr issued a ract rule that requires nox emission reductions at egus as part of the federal ozone sip submittal to address non attainment areas in wisconsin 
facility modifications are not necessary at the sheboygan falls energy facility to comply with this rule 
as part of its environmental compliance plan  wpl completed investments for installation of nox emission control technologies at edgewater to meet the to compliance requirements phase i 
additional investments will be needed at edgewater to achieve compliance with the requirements that include facility boiler nox rate limitations and a mass emissions cap phase ii 
refer to strategic overview environmental compliance plans wpl s emission control projects for discussion of proposed emission controls for further nox emission reductions at edgewater to meet compliance deadlines 
ozone naaqs rule in  the epa announced reductions in the primary naaqs for eight hour ozone to a level of parts per million ppm from the previous standard of ppm 
in january  the epa issued a proposal to reduce the primary standard to a level within the range of to ppm and establish a new seasonal secondary standard 
the final rule is expected to be issued by july depending on the level and location of non attainment areas  alliant energy  ipl and wpl may be subject to additional nox emissions reduction requirements to meet the new ozone standard

alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict the impact of any potential changes to the ozone naaqs on their financial condition and results of operations 
fine particle naaqs rule the epa lowered the hour fine particle primary naaqs pm naaqs from micrograms per cubic meter ug m to ug m in in  the epa announced final designation of pm non attainment areas 
ipl and wpl do not have any generating facilities in the non attainment areas announced in however  in  the dc circuit court issued a decision for litigation regarding the epa s determination not to lower the annual pm naaqs in in response to the litigation decision  the epa must re evaluate its justification for not tightening the annual standard related to adverse effects on health and visibility 
if the annual pm standard becomes more stringent  it could require so and nox emission reductions in additional areas not currently designated as non attainment 
the schedule for compliance with this rule has not yet been established 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict the potential impact of the re evaluation of the annual pm naaqs on their financial condition and results of operations 
nitrogen dioxide no naaqs rule in january  the epa issued a final rule to strengthen the primary naaqs for nox as measured by no the final rule establishes a new one hour naaqs for no of ppb and associated ambient air monitoring requirements  while maintaining the current annual standard of ppb 
the epa is expected to designate non attainment areas for the new no naaqs by january the final rule is currently being challenged by several groups in the dc circuit court 
the schedule for compliance with this rule has not yet been established 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict the impact of any potential no naaqs changes on their financial condition or results of operations 
so naaqs rule in june  the epa issued a final rule that establishes a new one hour naaqs for so at a level of ppb

alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict the impact of any potential so naaqs changes on their financial condition or results of operations 
industrial boiler and process heater mact rule the initial industrial boiler and process heater mact rule issued by the epa contained compliance requirements beginning in related to haps from fossil fueled egus with less than mw capacity as well as certain auxiliary boilers and process heaters operated at egus 
in  a court decision vacated the initial rule 
in february  the epa promulgated a revised industrial boiler and process heater mact rule 
the revised industrial boiler and process heater mact rule will be effective days after it is published in the federal register 
the caa requirements of section state that the standards become effective upon promulgation of the final rule and that compliance is required no later than three years after 
table of contents the effective date of the standards 
based on this requirement  the anticipated deadline for compliance with this rule is the federal caa generally requires affected facilities to submit to state permitting authorities an application for a case by case mact determination for all potentially affected egus under this rule 
case by case mact determinations are the compliance measures that are in effect until revised final federal regulations can replace these interim requirements 
ipl and wpl submitted case by case permit application information in the outcome of the case by case mact determinations by the iowa dnr and wisconsin dnr are uncertain at this time 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl will monitor future developments relating to this rule and update their environmental compliance plans as needed 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict the outcome of the industrial boiler and process heater mact rule  but expect that capital investments and or modifications to meet compliance requirements of the rule could be significant 
emission standards for internal combustion engines in march  the epa issued a final rule establishing national emission standards for haps for existing diesel fired stationary reciprocating internal combustion engines rice  including compression ignition engines

in some cases  the epa has responded to these comments and petitions with orders to the wisconsin dnr to reconsider the air operating permits of wpl s generating facilities 
wpl has received renewed air permits for columbia  edgewater and nelson dewey from the wisconsin dnr  which considered all public comments received as part of the renewal process 
columbia in  the sierra club submitted a notice of intent to sue the epa for failure to respond to its petition encouraging the epa to challenge the air permit issued by the wisconsin dnr for columbia 
in  the epa responded to the sierra club petition and granted one of three issues from the sierra club petition  objecting to that portion of the permit issued by the wisconsin dnr 
in july  wpl received a copy of a notice of intent to file a civil lawsuit noi by the sierra club against the epa based on what the sierra club asserts is unreasonable delay in the epa performing its duties related to the granting or denial of the columbia air permit 
specifically  the sierra club alleges that because the wisconsin dnr has exceeded its day timeframe in which to respond to the epa s order  the epa must now act on the permit 
in september  the wisconsin dnr proposed a construction permit and a revised operation permit for columbia 
in october  wpl submitted comments objecting to the appropriateness of the proposed draft permits 
in november  the comment period closed  and in february  the wisconsin dnr made the determination not to issue either of the permits 
alliant energy and wpl believe the previously issued air permit for columbia is still valid 
alliant energy and wpl are currently unable to predict the outcome of this matter and its impact on their financial condition or results of operations 
edgewater in  the sierra club petitioned the epa to object to a proposed title v air permit for edgewater that the wisconsin dnr had submitted to the epa for review

table of contents water quality section b of federal clean water act the federal clean water act requires the epa to regulate cooling water intake structures to assure that these structures reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts to fish and other aquatic life 
the second phase of this epa rule is generally referred to as section b 
section b applies to existing cooling water intake structures at large steam egus 
in  a court opinion invalidated aspects of the section b  which allowed for consideration of cost effectiveness when determining the appropriate compliance measures 
as a result  the epa formally suspended section b in in  the us supreme court granted the epa authority to use a cost benefit analysis when setting technology based requirements under section b 
a revised section b rule reflecting the us supreme court s decision is anticipated to be proposed by the epa in and a final rule is expected in ipl and wpl have identified six prairie creek unit  fox lake units and  lansing units  dubuque units and  ml kapp unit  burlington unit and two nelson dewey units and edgewater units generating facilities  respectively  which may be impacted by the revised section b rule 
the schedule for compliance with this rule has not yet been established 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict the final requirements from section b  but expect that capital investments and or modifications resulting from the rule could be significant 
wisconsin state thermal rule section a of federal clean water act requires the epa to regulate thermal impacts from wastewater discharges of industrial facilities  including those from egus 
states have authority to establish standards for these discharges in order to minimize adverse environmental impacts to aquatic life 
all ipl and wpl facilities are subject to these standards upon state promulgation  which become applicable upon their incorporation into a facility s wastewater discharge permit 
in january  the wisconsin natural resources board adopted its state standard for regulating the amount of heat that facilities can discharge into wisconsin waters 
this rule was necessary because the epa determined that wisconsin had not developed a state thermal standard consistent with section a of the federal clean water act 
the wisconsin state thermal rule was approved by the epa in october compliance with the thermal rule will be evaluated on a case by case basis as wastewater discharge permits for wpl s generating facilities are renewed in the future 
alliant energy and wpl continue to evaluate the thermal rule regulatory requirements and the compliance options available to meet the heat limitations for discharges from wpl s egus 
alliant energy and wpl are unable to predict the final requirements of this rule until wastewater discharge permits for impacted facilities are renewed 
if capital investments and or modifications are required  alliant energy and wpl believe these investments could be significant

in december  wpl completed the installation of the agency approved fish protective device 
wpl continues to work with the agencies to design and install the fish passage 
the us fish and wildlife service and the wisconsin dnr have requested additional information to support the conceptual plan for the fish passage and extended the required completion date to dec 
 wpl currently expects to request an additional extension from ferc in alliant energy and wpl believe the required capital investments and or modifications to comply with the ferc order for the fish passage at wpl s prairie du sac hydro plant could be significant 
land and solid waste ccrs alliant energy  ipl and wpl are monitoring potential regulatory changes that may affect the rules for operation and maintenance of ash surface impoundments ash ponds and or landfills  in the wake of a structural failure in the containment berm of an ash surface impoundment at a different utility 
in  ipl and wpl responded to information collection requests from the epa for data on coal ash surface impoundments at certain of their facilities 
the epa continues to evaluate the responses and conducted on site follow up inspections at certain ipl and wpl sites in in june  the epa issued a proposed rule seeking comment regarding two potential regulatory options for management of ccrs regulate as a special waste under the federal hazardous waste regulations when the ccr is destined for disposal  but continue to allow beneficial use applications of ccrs as a non hazardous material  or regulate as a non hazardous waste for all applications subject to new national standards 
these proposed regulations include additional requirements with significant impact for ccr management  beneficial use applications and disposal 
ipl and wpl have nine and four current or former coal generating facilities  respectively  with one or more existing ash surface impoundments 
in addition  ipl and wpl each have two active ccr company owned landfills 
all of these ccr disposal units would be subject to the proposed rule anticipated to be final in the schedule for compliance with this rule has not yet been established 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict the impact of these information collection requests  site inspections  or potential regulations resulting from such requests for the management of ccrs  but expect that capital investments  operating expenditures and or modifications to comply with ccr rules could be significant 

table of contents closed ash landfill sites in  ipl received communication from the iowa dnr regarding an evaluation of groundwater monitoring results for four of its closed ash landfills and a request to further evaluate potential offsite groundwater impacts at two of its closed landfills 
the iowa dnr approved ipl s plans to evaluate potential offsite groundwater impacts at these two landfills in work was completed at one of the landfills in work at the other landfill has not been completed pending additional analysis from the installation of an additional groundwater monitoring well

ghg emissions climate change continues to garner public attention along with support for policymakers to take action to mitigate global warming 
there is considerable debate regarding the public policy response that the us should adopt  involving both domestic actions and international efforts 
several members of congress have proposed legislation to regulate ghg emissions  primarily targeting reductions of carbon dioxide co emissions 
the epa is responding to a court ruling that requires issuance of federal rules to reduce ghg emissions under the existing caa 
associated regulations to implement these federal ghg rules are also underway in the states covering ipl s and wpl s service territories 
given the highly uncertain outcome and timing of future regulations regarding the control of ghg emissions  alliant energy  ipl and wpl currently cannot predict the financial impact of any future climate change regulations on their operations but believe the expenditures to comply with any new emissions regulations could be significant 
significant uncertainty exists surrounding the final implementation of the epa s ghg regulations 
furthermore  while implementation of these regulations continues to proceed  the impacts of these regulations remain subject to change as a consequence of the complexity and magnitude of determining how to effectively control ghgs under the existing legal framework of the caa  which may include the epa and state agency interpretations of appropriate permitting and emission compliance requirements 
the outcome of these regulations and challenges will determine whether and how ghg stationary sources  including electric utility operations  will be regulated under the caa 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict the timing and nature of stationary source rules for ghg emissions including future issuance of regulations that would mandate reductions of ghgs at electric utilities 
in  the epa issued a final endangerment and cause or contribute findings for ghg under the caa with an effective date of january this final action includes two distinct findings regarding ghg emissions under the caa 
first  the current and projected concentrations of ghg emissions in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations 
this is referred to as the endangerment finding and includes the six key ghg emissions identified in the epa s mandatory ghg reporting rule 
second  the combined emissions of co  methane ch  nitrous oxide no  and hydrofluorocarbons hfcs from new motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines contribute to the atmospheric concentrations of these key ghg emissions and hence to the threat of climate change 
this is referred to as the cause or contribute finding 
in april  the epa  under authority from the ghg endangerment and cause or contribute findings  also issued a final rule that regulates ghg emissions from motor vehicles as a pollutant under the caa 
this finding and rule are subject to legal challenges in the dc circuit court 
these actions by the epa enable it to regulate ghg stationary sources  including electric utility operations and natural gas distribution operations 
the primary ghg emitted from alliant energy s utility operations is co from the combustion of fossil fuels at its larger egus 
alliant energy s annual co emissions from its larger egus  in terms of total mass  ranged from million tons or million metric tons to million tons or million metric tons during the through period 
these amounts represent emissions from ipl s and wpl s ownership portion of fossil fueled egus with a design nameplate of mw or greater that are required to be equipped with continuous emissions monitoring systems 

table of contents epa mandatory ghg reporting rule in december  the final epa mandatory ghg reporting rule became effective 
the final rule does not require control of ghg emissions  rather it requires that sources above certain threshold levels monitor and report emissions 
the epa anticipates that the data collected by this rule will improve the us government s ability to formulate a set of climate change policy options 
the ghg emissions covered by the final epa reporting rule include co  ch  no  sulfur hexafluoride  hfcs  perfluorocarbons and other fluorinated gases 
emissions of ghg will be reported at the facility level in coe and include those facilities that emit  metric tons or more of coe annually 
the final rule applies to electric utility and natural gas distribution operations at ipl and wpl 
the annual reporting compliance requirement begins for calendar year  with the first ghg emissions reports due by march  alliant energy continues to maintain and update its emissions monitoring methodologies and data collection procedures to capture all the ghg emissions data required to comply with the epa s mandatory ghg reporting rule 
this rule is subject to legal challenge in the dc circuit court 
epa nsps for ghg emissions from electric utilities in december  the epa announced the future issuance of ghg standards for electric utilities under the caa 
the ghg emission limits are to be established as nsps for new and existing fossil fueled egus 
the epa is expected to propose nsps by july and finalize nsps by may for existing egus  the nsps issued by the epa is expected to include emission guidelines that states must use to develop plans for reducing egu ghg emissions 
the guidelines will be established based on demonstrated controls  ghg emission reductions  costs and expected timeframes for installation and compliance 
under existing epa regulations  states must submit their plans to the epa within nine months after publication of the guidelines unless the epa sets a different schedule 
states have the ability to apply less or more stringent standards  or longer or shorter compliance schedules 
the implications of the epa s nsps rule for ghg emissions from egus are highly uncertain  including the nature of required emissions controls and compliance timeline for mandating reductions of ghgs 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict the final outcome  but expect that expenditures to comply with any regulations to reduce ghg emissions could be significant 
epa ghg tailoring rule in june  the epa issued the ghg tailoring rule  which became effective on jan 
 the rule establishes a ghg emissions threshold for major sources under the psd construction permit and title v operation permit programs at  tons per year tpy of coe 
the rule also establishes a threshold for what will be considered a significant increase in ghg emissions 
new major sources and significantly modified existing sources of ghg will be required to obtain psd construction permits that demonstrate bact emissions measures to minimize ghg 
the rule establishes a phased in implementation schedule for compliance with these ghg permitting requirements 
through june  ghg requirements only apply to sources that are already obtaining caa permits for other non ghg pollutants 
in july  ghg requirements will apply to all new major sources and modifications at existing major sources that would increase ghg emissions by at least  tpy for coe 
the rule is subject to legal challenges in the dc circuit court 
the implications of the epa s ghg tailoring rule are highly uncertain  and alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict the impact on their financial condition or results of operations  but expect that expenditures to comply with these regulations to reduce ghg emissions could be significant

legislative matters recent legislative developments federal tax legislation in  the sbja and the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of the act were enacted 
the most significant provisions of the sbja and the act for alliant energy  ipl and wpl were provisions related to the extension of bonus depreciation deductions for certain expenditures for property that are incurred through dec 
 based on capital projects placed into service in and capital projects expected to be placed into service in  alliant energy currently estimates its total bonus depreciation deductions to be claimed in its and us federal income tax returns will be approximately million includes million for ipl and million for wpl and million includes million for ipl and million for wpl  respectively 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to estimate their bonus depreciation deductions to be claimed on their us federal income tax return but believe bonus depreciation deductions will likely contribute to annual federal net operating losses through alliant energy s federal net operating losses carryforwards including mixed service costs are currently expected to offset future federal taxable income through resulting in minimal federal cash tax payments to the irs by alliant energy  ipl and wpl through refer to note of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the sbja and the act 

table of contents federal health care legislation in march  the patient protection and affordable care act  and health care and education reconciliation act of federal health care legislation were enacted 
one of the most significant provisions of the federal health care legislation for alliant energy  ipl and wpl requires a reduction in their tax deductions for retiree health care costs beginning in  to the extent their drug expenses are reimbursed under the medicare part d retiree drug subsidy program 
the reduction in the future deductibility of retiree health care costs accrued as of dec 
 required alliant energy  ipl and wpl to record deferred income tax expense of million  million and million  respectively  in in addition  alliant energy  ipl and wpl currently anticipate increased annual tax expense beginning in of approximately million  million  and million  respectively  as a result of this legislation 
the federal health care legislation also contains provisions that may impact future benefits costs for alliant energy  ipl and wpl 
these provisions include the elimination of annual and lifetime caps for certain benefits beginning in and the implementation of an excise tax for health insurance plans with annual premiums in excess of certain thresholds beginning in refer to notes and a of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the federal health care legislation 
federal regulatory reform legislation in july  the dodd frank act was enacted 
one of the most significant financial provisions of the dodd frank act for alliant energy  ipl and wpl is a commercial end user exemption that is expected to allow utilities to continue trading derivatives over the counter without having to make such trades through cleared exchanges with collateral requirements 
as a result of this commercial end user exemption  alliant energy  ipl and wpl currently do not believe the dodd frank act will have a material impact on their financial condition and results of operations

 alliant energy s results of operations overview executive summary provides an overview of alliant energy s  and earnings and the various components of alliant energy s business 
additional details of alliant energy s  and earnings are discussed below 
utility electric margins electric margins are defined as electric operating revenues less electric production fuel  energy purchases and purchased electric capacity expenses 
management believes that electric margins provide a more meaningful basis for evaluating utility operations than electric operating revenues since electric production fuel  energy purchases and purchased electric capacity expenses are generally passed through to customers  and therefore  result in changes to electric operating revenues that are comparable to changes in electric production fuel  energy purchases and purchased electric capacity expenses 
electric margins and mwh sales for alliant energy were as follows revenues and costs dollars in millions mwhs sold mwhs in thousands a b a b residential commercial industrial retail subtotal sales for resale wholesale bulk power and other other total revenues sales electric production fuel expense energy purchases expense purchased electric capacity expense margins a reflects the change from to b reflects the change from to vs

the cost of fossil fuels used during each period is included in electric production fuel expense 
alliant energy also purchases electricity to meet the demand of its customers and charges these costs to energy purchases expense 
alliant energy s electric production fuel expense decreased million in and million  or  in the decrease was primarily due to lower costs of natural gas swap contracts used to mitigate pricing volatility for fuel used to supply ipl s emery generating station  substantially offset by higher coal volumes burned at its generating facilities resulting from increased generation needed to serve the higher electricity demand in the decrease was primarily due to lower coal volumes burned at its generating facilities resulting from reduced generation needed to serve the lower electricity demand in alliant energy s energy purchases expense decreased million  or  in and increased million  or  in the decrease was primarily due to lower energy volumes purchased and lower energy prices 
the increase was primarily due to higher energy purchased volumes and higher costs in related to derivative instruments used to mitigate pricing volatility for the electricity purchased to supply to its customers 
the impact of the changes in energy purchases volumes were largely offset by the impact of changes in bulk power sales volumes discussed below 
due to ipl s rate recovery mechanisms for fuel related costs  changes in fuel related costs resulted in comparable changes in electric revenues and  therefore  did not have a significant impact on ipl s electric margins 
wpl s rate recovery mechanism for wholesale fuel related costs also provides for adjustments to its wholesale electric rates for changes in commodity costs  thereby mitigating impacts of changes to commodity costs on wpl s electric margins

liquidity and capital resources overview alliant energy  ipl and wpl believe they have  and expect to maintain  an adequate liquidity position to operate their businesses as a result of available capacity under their revolving credit facilities  operating cash flows generated by their utility business  and available cash and cash equivalents 
based on their liquidity positions and capital structures  alliant energy  ipl and wpl believe they will be able to secure the additional capital required to implement their strategic plans and meet their long term contractual obligations 
access by alliant energy  ipl and wpl to capital markets to fund their future capital requirements at reasonable terms is largely dependent on their respective credit quality and on developments in those capital markets 
liquidity position at dec

capital structure alliant energy  ipl and wpl plan to maintain consolidated debt to total capitalization ratios that are consistent with investment grade credit ratings in order to facilitate ongoing and reliable access to capital markets on reasonable terms and conditions 
alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s capital structures at dec 
 were as follows dollars in millions alliant energy consolidated ipl wpl common equity preferred stock noncontrolling interest long term debt incl 
current maturities short term debt in addition to capital structures  other important financial considerations used to determine the characteristics of future financings include financial coverage ratios  flexibility regarding the generation plans  state regulations and the levels of debt imputed by rating agencies 
the most significant debt imputations include operating leases  a portion of the daec  kewaunee and riverside ppas  and postretirement benefits obligations 
the pscw explicitly factors certain imputed debt adjustments in establishing a regulatory capital structure as part of wpl s retail rate cases  particularly those related to operating leases and ppas 
the iub and mpuc do not make any explicit adjustments for imputed debt in establishing capital ratios used in determining customer rates  although such adjustments are considered by ipl in recommending an equity ratio 

table of contents alliant energy  ipl and wpl intend to manage their respective capital structures and liquidity positions in such a way that they do not compromise their ability to raise the necessary funding required to enable them to continue to provide utility services reliably and at reasonable costs  while maintaining financial capital structure targets consistent with those approved by regulators 
key considerations include maintaining access to the financial markets on the terms  in the amounts and within the timeframes required to fund alliant energy s strategic plan  retaining a prudent level of financial flexibility and maintaining ipl s and wpl s investment grade credit ratings 
the capital structure is only one of a number of components that needs to be actively managed in order to achieve these objectives 
both ipl and wpl currently expect to maintain a capital structure in which total debt would not exceed to  and preferred stock would not exceed to  of total capital 
these targets may be adjusted depending on subsequent developments and on their potential impact on ipl s and wpl s investment grade credit ratings 
credit and capital market developments alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s ability to provide reliable and cost effective utility services depends on their access to cost effective capital 
financial markets that were subjected to considerable strain since have shown signs of selective recovery 
certain sectors of the equity and debt capital markets  including the regulated utility sector  have attracted and retained investor interest 
however  areas of concern remain  including certain issues in the us and overseas  which have impacted the availability of credit and the liquidity of financial assets 
there is also concern about the level of spending by the us federal government and the temporary monetary policies of the federal reserve system intended to spur economic growth  with potential implications over time for inflation and interest rate levels 
the evolving profile and impact of financial market re regulation  both in the us and overseas  contributes to the unsettled tone of the various market sectors 
these developments translate into uncertainties regarding the availability of capital and for the terms and conditions of capital raised to meet funding requirements 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are aware of the potential implications that these credit and capital market developments might have on their ability to raise the external funding required for their respective operations and capital expenditure plans 
the strategic implications include protecting their respective liquidity positions and avoiding over reliance on short term funding to meet ipl s and wpl s long term asset profile 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl maintain revolving credit facilities to provide backstop liquidity to their commercial paper programs and a committed source of alternative liquidity in the event the commercial paper market becomes disrupted  retain sufficient cash and cash equivalents at the parent company to help meet alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s current operating and capital requirements in the event of credit market disruptions  and extended ipl s and wpl s respective long term debt maturity profiles  avoiding undue concentrations of maturities over the next few years as ipl and wpl execute their capital investment program 
in addition  alliant energy and ipl maintain a sales of accounts receivable program at ipl as an alternative financing source 
as discussed below  ipl and wpl retain flexibility in undertaking their capital expenditure programs  particularly with respect to capital expenditures to fund the investment programs within their strategic plans 
primary sources and uses of cash alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s most significant source of cash is from electric and gas sales to their utility customers 
cash from these sales reimburses ipl and wpl for prudently incurred expenses to provide service to their utility customers and provides ipl and wpl a return on the rate base assets required to provide such services 
utility operating cash flows are expected to cover the majority of ipl s and wpl s capital expenditures required to maintain their current infrastructure and dividends paid to alliant energy s shareowners 
capital requirements needed to retire debt and fund capital expenditures related to environmental compliance programs and new generating facilities are expected to be met primarily through external financings 
ongoing monitoring of credit and capital market conditions allows management to evaluate the availability of funding and the terms and conditions attached to such financing 
in order to maintain debt to total capitalization ratios that are consistent with investment grade ratings  alliant energy  ipl and wpl may periodically fund such capital requirements with additional debt and equity

other matters market risk sensitive instruments and positions alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s primary market risk exposures are associated with commodity prices  investment prices and interest rates 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl have risk management policies to monitor and assist in controlling these market risks and use derivative instruments to manage some of the exposures 
refer to notes i and of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s derivative instruments 
commodity price alliant energy  ipl and wpl are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of commodities they procure and market 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl employ established policies and procedures to mitigate their risks associated with these market fluctuations including the use of various commodity derivatives and contracts of various durations for the forward sale and purchase of these commodities 
alliant energy s exposure to commodity price risks in its utility business is also significantly mitigated by current rate making structures in place for recovery of its electric production fuel and purchased energy expenses fuel related costs as well as its cost of natural gas purchased for resale 
ipl s and wpl s electric and gas tariffs provide for subsequent adjustments to their rates for changes in prudently incurred commodity costs 
ipl s and wpl s rate mechanisms  combined with commodity derivatives  significantly reduce commodity risk associated with their electric and gas margins 
wpl s retail electric margins have the most exposure to the impact of changes in commodity prices for alliant energy and wpl due largely to the current retail recovery mechanism in place in wisconsin for fuel related costs  which became effective on jan 
 the cost recovery mechanism applicable for wpl s retail electric customers is based on forecasts of fuel related costs expected to be incurred during forward looking test year periods and fuel monitoring ranges determined by the pscw during each electric retail rate proceeding or in a separate fuel cost plan approval proceeding 
in december  the pscw approved annual forecasted fuel related costs per mwh of based on million of variable fuel costs for wpl s test period and left unchanged the annual fuel monitoring range of plus or minus 
under the new cost recovery mechanism  if wpl s actual fuel related costs fall outside this fuel monitoring range during the test period  wpl is authorized to defer the incremental over or under collection of fuel related costs from electric retail customers that are outside the approved ranges 
any over or under collection of fuel related costs for each year are reflected in future billings to customers 
based on this new cost recovery mechanism in wisconsin and the annual forecasted fuel related costs and fuel monitoring range approved by the pscw in december  alliant energy and wpl currently estimate the commodity risk exposure to wpl s electric margins in is approximately million 
refer to rate matters and note h of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details of utility cost recovery mechanisms that significantly reduce commodity risk for ipl and wpl

new accounting pronouncements refer to note t of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of new accounting pronouncements impacting alliant energy  ipl and wpl 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements 
based on historical experience and various other factors  alliant energy  ipl and wpl believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to their business and the understanding of their financial results as they require critical assumptions and judgments by management 
the results of these assumptions and judgments form the basis for making estimates regarding the results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual financial results may differ materially from these estimates 
alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s management has discussed these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of their board of directors 
refer to note of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s accounting policies and the estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
contingencies alliant energy  ipl and wpl make assumptions and judgments each reporting period regarding the future outcome of contingent events and record loss contingency amounts for any contingent events that are both probable and reasonably estimated based upon current available information 
the amounts recorded may differ from the actual income or expense that occurs when the uncertainty is resolved 
the estimates that alliant energy  ipl and wpl make in accounting for contingencies  and the gains and losses that they record upon the ultimate resolution of these uncertainties  could have a significant effect on the results of operations and the amount of assets and liabilities in their financial statements 
note of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements provides discussion of contingencies assessed at dec 
 including various pending legal proceedings that may have a material impact on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s financial condition or results of operations 
regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities alliant energy s utility subsidiaries ipl and wpl are regulated by various federal and state regulatory agencies 
as a result  they are subject to accounting guidance for regulated operations  which recognizes that the actions of a regulator can provide reasonable assurance of the existence of an asset or liability 
regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities arise as a result of a difference between gaap and the accounting principles imposed by the regulatory agencies 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred as they are probable of recovery in future customer rates 
regulatory liabilities represent obligations to make refunds to customers and amounts collected in rates for which the related costs have not yet been incurred 
ipl and wpl recognize regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities in accordance with the rulings of their federal and state regulators and future regulatory rulings may impact the carrying value and accounting treatment of alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl make assumptions and judgments each reporting period regarding whether their regulatory assets are probable of future recovery and their regulatory liabilities are probable of future obligations by considering factors such as regulatory environment changes  rate orders issued by the applicable regulatory agencies and historical decisions by applicable regulatory agencies regarding similar regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities 
the assumptions and judgments used by regulatory authorities have an impact on the recovery of costs  the rate of return on invested capital and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates 
a change in these assumptions may result in a material impact on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s results of operations and the amount of assets and liabilities in their financial statements 
note b of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements provides details of the nature and amounts of alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities assessed at dec 
 long lived assets alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s consolidated balance sheets include long lived assets  which are not yet being recovered from their customers or may cease to be recovered from their customers as a result of regulatory decisions in the future 
as a result  alliant energy  ipl and wpl must determine whether they will be able to generate sufficient future cash flows from such assets to ensure recovery of the carrying value of the long lived assets 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl assess the carrying amount and potential impairment of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered in determining if an impairment review is necessary include a significant underperformance of the assets relative to historical or projected future operating results  a significant change in the use of the acquired assets or business strategy related to such assets  and significant negative industry  regulatory or economic trends 
when an impairment review is deemed necessary  a comparison is made between the expected undiscounted future cash flows and the carrying amount of the asset 
if the carrying amount of the 
table of contents asset is the larger of the two balances  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the fair value is determined by the use of quoted market prices  appraisals  or the use of valuation techniques such as expected discounted future cash flows 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl make assumptions and judgments each reporting period regarding the recoverability of certain long lived assets including assets held for sale and assets not yet being recovered from their customers 
alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s assets assessed at dec 
 include the iea business currently held for sale  and wind sites and wind turbine generators currently expected to be used to develop future wind projects

unbilled revenues unbilled revenues are primarily associated with alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s utility operations 
energy sales to individual customers are based on the reading of customers meters  which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month 
amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated at the end of each reporting period and the corresponding estimated unbilled revenue is recorded 
the unbilled revenue estimate is based on daily system demand volumes  estimated customer usage by class  weather impacts  line losses and the most recent customer rates 
such process involves the use of various judgments and assumptions and significant changes in these judgments and assumptions could have a material impact on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s results of operations

 sold to a third party financial institution under an amended and restated receivables purchase and sale agreement that became effective in april pensions and other postretirement benefits alliant energy  ipl and wpl sponsors various defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits plans that provide benefits to a significant portion of their employees 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl make assumptions and judgments periodically to estimate the obligations and costs related to their retirement plans 
there are many judgments and assumptions involved in determining an entity s pension and other postretirement liabilities and costs each period including employee demographics including age  life expectancies and compensation levels  discount rates  assumed rate of returns and funding 
changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future benefits costs 
judgments and assumptions are supported by historical data and reasonable projections and are reviewed annually 
as of dec 
 alliant energy s most recent measurement date  future assumptions for alliant energy included the following defined benefit pension plans other postretirement benefits plans discount rate to calculate benefit obligations a future annual expected rate of return on plan assets b a in selecting an assumed discount rate  management reviews various corporate aa bond indices

income taxes alliant energy  ipl and wpl are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl make assumptions and judgments each reporting period to estimate their income tax assets  liabilities  benefits and expenses 
judgments and assumptions are supported by historical data and reasonable projections 
significant changes in these judgments and assumptions could have a material impact on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s financial condition and results of operations 
alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s critical assumptions and judgments for include projections of alliant energy s future taxable income used to determine its ability to utilize federal net operating loss and credit carry forwards prior to their expiration and the interpretation of tax laws regarding uncertain tax positions 
federal net operating loss carryforward utilization alliant energy s federal tax returns for calendar years and have included net operating losses primarily due to a change in tax method of accounting for repair expenditure deductions included in its tax return and bonus depreciation deductions allowed in its tax return 
alliant energy also currently anticipates a federal net operating loss on its federal tax returns for calendar years through primarily due to additional bonus depreciation deductions eligible under new tax legislation enacted in federal net operating losses for each calendar year can be utilized to offset federal taxable income in other years by generally carrying the losses back two years or forward years 
alliant energy carried back a portion of the net operating losses generated in and and currently plans to utilize the remaining portion of its federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately million at dec 
 to offset federal taxable income in the future 
based on current projections of alliant energy s future federal taxable income  alliant energy currently plans to utilize its current net operating loss carryforwards prior to their expiration  therefore no valuation allowances have been recorded by alliant energy  ipl and wpl for deferred tax assets associated with their federal net operating loss carryforwards as of dec 
 changes in assumptions regarding alliant energy s future taxable income could have a material impact on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s financial condition and results of operations 
federal tax credit carryforward utilization alliant energy generates federal tax credits each year primarily based on the amount of electricity generated by wind projects at ipl and wpl and the amount of its research and development activities 
in addition  in prior years  alliant energy generated significant non conventional source fuel credits 
federal tax credits reduce alliant energy s federal income tax obligations in calendar years that alliant energy generates sufficient federal taxable income to utilize the tax credits 
if alliant energy does not generate sufficient federal taxable income to utilize the federal tax credits generated for that year  the federal tax credits can be carried back and carried forward to be utilized to reduce federal income tax in prior or subsequent years 
the federal tax credits have different expiration periods with the most stringent limiting the carry forward period to years 
alliant energy currently plans to utilize the remaining portion of its federal tax credit carryforward of approximately million at dec 
 to offset federal tax obligations in the future 
based on current projections of alliant energy s future federal taxable income  alliant energy currently plans to utilize all current federal tax credit carryforwards prior to their expiration  therefore no valuation allowances have been recorded by alliant energy  ipl and wpl for deferred tax assets associated with their federal tax credit carryforwards as of dec 
 changes in assumptions regarding alliant energy s future taxable income could have a material impact on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s financial condition and results of operations 
state net operating loss carryforward utilization alliant energy generated significant state net operating losses over the past years that are currently being carried forward 
at dec 
  the state net operating losses being carried forward had expiration dates ranging from to with expiring after due to uncertainty in the realization of these state net operating losses being carried forward  alliant energy established deferred tax asset valuation allowances related to state net operating loss carryforwards of million at dec 
 changes in assumptions regarding alliant energy s ability to utilize state net operating loss carryforwards could have a material impact on alliant energy s financial condition and results of operations

the attachment o rate is based on itc s projected net revenue requirement for the upcoming calendar year ie the year the rates will be billed as well as a true up adjustment for any over or under recovered amounts from the previous calendar year ie two years prior to the year the rates will be billed 
because attachment o is a ferc approved formula rate  itc can implement new rates each calendar year without filing a request with ferc 
however  new rates are subject to challenge by ferc if the rates proposed by itc are determined by ferc to be unjust or unreasonable or another mechanism is determined by ferc to be just and reasonable 
in september  itc filed with miso the attachment o rate it proposes to charge its customers in for electric transmission services 
the proposed rate was based on itc s net revenue requirement for as well as the impact of a million true up adjustment related to amounts that itc under recovered from its customers in the attachment o rate filed with miso is approximately the same as the rate itc charged its customers in  which included the impact of a million true up adjustment related to amounts that itc under recovered from its customers in in january  the iub issued an order authorizing ipl to defer the iowa retail portion of the under recovered costs billed in and amortize these deferred costs over a five year period with an equal and offsetting amount of amortization of ipl s regulatory liability related to its electric transmission assets sale 
in january  the iub issued an order authorizing ipl to use million of the regulatory liability related to its electric transmission assets sale to offset the iowa retail portion of the under recovered costs expected to be billed to ipl by itc in excluding the impact of the under recovered costs from and that will be offset with regulatory liabilities  ipl currently estimates the electric transmission service costs expected to be billed in will be approximately million to million higher than the comparable costs billed in ipl expects to recover a significant portion of these higher transmission service costs in with the implementation of an automatic transmission cost recovery rider approved by the iub in the first quarter of refer to rate matters for additional details of the transmission cost recovery rider approved by the iub and a proposal made by ipl in to the mpuc to implement an automatic transmission cost recovery rider for electric transmission service costs incurred by ipl to serve its minnesota retail electric customers 
in  ipl filed a ferc complaint against itc concerning certain cost components included in itc s proposed rates 
itc requested that the ferc complaint be dismissed on the grounds that the asset sale agreement between ipl and itc barred ipl from challenging the rate elements for a seven year period 
ipl maintains that its complaint does not take issue with the use of forward looking data to set rates and instead is challenging how these rates were implemented 
in april  ferc denied ipl s ferc complaint filed against itc 
ferc concluded that ipl had not presented adequate evidence that itc s formula rate implementation produced unjust and unreasonable rates with respect to operations and maintenance and administrative and general expenses for ferc also rejected ipl s allegations that itc had not been adequately forthcoming with information about its projected rates and true up 
in may  ipl filed a request for rehearing with ferc 
in june  ferc granted ipl s request for rehearing  however  it is unknown when ferc will take final action on the complaint 
miso transmission cost allocation in july  miso filed a proposed revised tariff with ferc for a new category of transmission projects called multi value projects mvps 
mvps include new large scale transmission projects that enable the reliable and economic delivery of energy in support of documented energy policy mandates or provide economic value across multiple pricing zones within miso 
the mvp category is intended to facilitate the integration of large amounts of location constrained resources including renewable resources  support miso member and customer compliance with evolving state and federal energy policy requirements  enable miso to address multiple reliability needs and provide economic opportunities through regional transmission development 
the proposed revised tariff would allow certain costs of mvps to be socialized across the entire miso footprint based on energy usage by the miso participants to ensure that areas within the miso footprint that have large amounts of generation and a small share of load are not allocated a disproportionate amount of the costs for mvps 
in december  ferc conditionally approved miso s proposal for the mvp transmission cost allocation 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to determine the ultimate impact that the revised tariff may have on their financial condition and results of operation  but believe the outcome could be material to their future electric transmission service expense 

table of contents government incentives for wind projects alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s corporate strategy includes building wind projects to produce electricity to meet customer demand and renewable portfolio standards 
in addition to producing electricity  these wind projects may also generate material incentives depending on when they begin generating electricity 
the arra enacted in february provided incentives to owners of wind projects placed into service between jan 
 and dec 
 the incentive options available to qualified wind projects under the arra include production tax credits for a year period based on the electricity output generated by the wind project  an investment tax credit equal to of the qualified cost basis of the wind project  or a government grant equal to of the qualified cost basis of the wind project 
in december  the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of modified the requirements for the government grant incentive 
the government grant incentive is now available for qualified wind projects that are placed into service in  or and qualified wind projects that began construction in  and and are placed into service by dec 
 alliant energy s generation plan has four wind projects that currently qualify  or may qualify  for one of the government incentives 
the four wind projects are wpl s cedar ridge wind project mw capacity that began generating electricity in late  ipl s whispering willow east wind project mw capacity that began generating electricity in late  wpl s bent tree phase i wind project mw capacity that began generating electricity in the fourth quarter of  and a proposed mw capacity wind project currently under evaluation 
based on an evaluation of the most beneficial alternative for customers  alliant energy  ipl and wpl have chosen to recognize production tax credits for the three eligible wind projects that are already generating electricity 
the amount of production tax credits is dependent on the level of electricity output generated by each wind project  which is impacted by a variety of operating and economic parameters including transmission availability 
any incentives for ipl s and wpl s wind projects are expected to be utilized in determining customers rates 
production tax credits earned for and along with estimates of production tax credits currently expected to be earned in for these wind projects are as follows in millions whispering willow east wind project ipl cedar ridge wind project wpl bent tree phase i wind project wpl tax accounting for mixed service costs in september  alliant energy filed a request with the irs for a change in its tax method of accounting for mixed service costs 
the requested change would allow alliant energy to currently deduct a portion of its mixed service costs  which have historically been capitalized for tax purposes 
if approved by the irs  this proposed change could be applied retroactively to mixed service costs incurred since alliant energy recently completed an assessment of its eligible mixed service costs for the period from through and currently believes it will include approximately million million for ipl and million for wpl of mixed service costs deductions for these years in its federal income tax return if the proposed change is approved by the irs 
these mixed service cost deductions are expected to contribute to a federal net operating loss in alliant energy s federal net operating losses incurred through including the impacts of mixed service costs deductions are currently expected to offset future federal taxable income resulting in minimal federal cash tax payments to the irs by alliant energy  ipl and wpl through in accordance with accounting rules  alliant energy  ipl and wpl will not reflect the impact of this proposed change to mixed service costs in its financial statements until they receive consent from the irs for the change in tax method of accounting for mixed service costs 
refer to rate matters recent retail base rate filings ipl s iowa retail electric rate case test year for discussion of a customer cost management plan that includes ipl using cash flows realized from this project to refund to its iowa retail customers 
alliant energy and ipl currently expect any cash flow tax benefits from this project will be refunded to ipl s iowa retail customers in and retirement plan costs alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s net periodic benefit costs related to their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits plans are currently expected to be lower in than by approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in expected net periodic benefit costs are primarily due to lower amortization of actuarial losses and higher expected returns on plan assets resulting from increases in retirement plan assets during approximately to of net periodic benefit costs are allocated to capital projects each year 
as a result  the decrease in net periodic benefit costs is not expected to result in a comparable decrease in other operation and maintenance expenses

table of contents electric sales projections alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently expecting modest approximately to increases in weather normalized retail electric sales in compared to largely due to a slow economic recovery  low customer growth and limited new ethanol production facilities in their service territories 
ethanol production ethanol production in the us experienced growth since largely due to a mandate for ethanol usage in the energy policy act of and the promotion of e  a blend of ethanol and gasoline  used to fuel vehicles 
ethanol production facilities in the us are concentrated in the corn growing regions in the midwest given corn is the primary raw material used to produce ethanol 
electricity demand from new ethanol production facilities located in alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s utility service territories has resulted in an increase in electric sales volumes in the last decade 
demand from ethanol plants is estimated to be approximately mw approximately mw in ipl s service territory and approximately mw in wpl s service territory in a number of previously announced plants in alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s service territories have not begun construction  which is reflective of a nationwide slowdown in the construction of ethanol production facilities 
this slowdown has been caused by a number of factors  including changes in the price of ethanol  cost of gasoline  cost of corn  tighter access to financing and escalation of construction costs to build the production facilities 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to estimate the impacts ethanol production facilities in their service territories will have on their future electric sales demand and electric margins 
maintenance costs for wind projects wind projects require periodic maintenance to ensure reliability of operations 
ipl and wpl have entered into agreements with outside vendors to provide these services for their whispering willow east and bent tree phase i wind projects 
ipl and wpl currently estimate approximately million to million of annual maintenance expenses for each of its whispering willow east and bent tree phase i wind projects after they begin generating electricity 
incentive compensation plans alliant energy s total compensation package includes an incentive compensation program  which provides substantially all of alliant energy s non bargaining employees an opportunity to receive annual short term incentive cash payments based on the achievement of specific annual operational and financial performance measures 
the operational performance measures for relate to diversity  safety  customer satisfaction  service reliability and generating facilities availability  and the financial performance measures for relate to utility earnings per share from continuing operations and cash flows from operations generated by ipl  wpl and corporate services 
in addition  the total compensation program for certain key employees includes long term incentive awards issued under an equity incentive plan 
refer to alliant energy s results of operations utility other operation and maintenance expenses for discussion of higher incentive related compensation expenses in and note b of alliant energy s combined notes to consolidated financial statements for details of long term incentive awards 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to determine what impacts these incentive compensation plans will have on their future financial condition or results of operations
