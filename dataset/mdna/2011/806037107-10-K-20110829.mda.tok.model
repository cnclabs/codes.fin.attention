item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below for a discussion of the amount of the company s net sales contributed by product categories 
industry overview the distribution channels for specialty technology products generally consist of manufacturers  wholesale distributors such as scansource  resellers and end users 
the sales channel for specialty technology products typically evolves through a three stage process i direct sales by manufacturers to end users  ii single tier distribution in which manufacturers sell to resellers who  in turn  sell directly to end users  and iii two tier  or wholesale distribution  in which manufacturers sell to wholesale distributors  including scansource  who sell only to resellers who  in turn  sell directly to end users 
currently  the technology products wholesale distribution channel is served by both broad line and specialty distributors 
the broad line distributors are engaged primarily in conventional order fulfillment and typically offer their reseller customers less support and fewer value added services than do specialty distributors 
the specialty distributors that compete with scansource are generally smaller  both in terms of size and geographic area covered 
competition among an expanding number of manufacturers typically causes product prices to decrease and product applications to expand  which has resulted in an increasing number of resellers entering the market in order to support a broader base of potential end users 
as the number of resellers and end users has grown  competition among manufacturers and within the reseller channel has intensified 
because many specialty technology manufacturers develop products that represent only one part of a total solution  most products eventually are developed to provide interoperability among products from multiple manufacturers 
as a result of interoperability  a variety of manufacturers products are typically configured together to create a system solution 
therefore  both manufacturers and resellers have become more dependent upon value added wholesale distributors such as scansource for the aggregation of products and reseller support services  as well as the organization and maintenance of an efficient market structure 
in addition  manufacturers that face declining product prices and rising costs of direct sales increasingly rely upon value added wholesale distributors by outsourcing certain support functions  such as product assortment  delivery  inventory management  technical assistance and marketing 
at the same time  shortened product life cycles and the introduction of new products and applications have caused resellers increasingly to rely on wholesale distributors for various inventory management  financing  technical support and related functions 
the company believes that as the reseller market grows and becomes more fragmented  and as specialty technology products continue to transition to open systems  the wholesale distribution channel in which the company operates will become increasingly more important

the company s key vendors in its security sales units include alvarion  axis  bosch  cisco  datacard  dsc  fargo  hid  march networks  panasonic  pelco  ruckus wireless  sony  united technologies fire and security and zebra card 
the company s products are typically purchased directly from the manufacturer on a non exclusive basis 
the company s agreements with its vendors generally do not restrict the company from selling similar or comparable products manufactured by competitors 
the company has the flexibility to terminate or curtail sales of one product line in favor of another due to technological change  pricing considerations  product availability  customer demand or vendor distribution policies 
the company has approximately hardware and software vendors that currently supply its products 
of all of the company s vendors  only two  motorola and avaya  each constituted more than of the company s net sales 
the company has three non exclusive distribution agreements with motorola 
one agreement covers sales of motorola hardware and software products in north and south america  another agreement covers sales of motorola hardware and software products in europe  the middle east and africa and another agreement covers sales of wireless products in europe 
the motorola agreements each have a one year term that automatically renews for additional one year terms  and either party may terminate the agreement upon days and days notice  respectively  to the other party 
the company also has two non exclusive distribution agreements with avaya 
one agreement covers the distribution of avaya products in the united states and the other agreement covers distribution of avaya products in the united kingdom and certain portions of continental europe 
in addition  the avaya agreements provide separate authorizations for the avaya enterprise communications group ecg and avaya small to medium business smb product lines 
the avaya agreements each have a one year term that automatically renews for additional one year terms if not terminated by either party upon days or days notice  respectively  to the other party 
in addition to the motorola and avaya agreements mentioned above  the company has written distribution agreements with almost all of its vendors 
these agreements are in the form that the company believes are customarily used by manufacturers and distributors 
the company s agreements generally provide it with non exclusive distribution rights and often include territorial restrictions that limit the countries in which the company can distribute its products 
these agreements typically provide the company with stock rotation and price protection provisions 
stock rotation rights give the company the ability  subject to certain limitations  to return for credit or exchange a portion of those inventory items purchased from the vendor 
price protection situations occur when a vendor credits the company for declines in inventory value resulting from the vendor s price reductions 
along with the company s inventory management policies and practices  these provisions are designed to reduce the company s risk of loss due to slow moving inventory  vendor price reductions  product updates or obsolescence 
some of the company s distribution agreements contain minimum purchase requirements that the company must meet in order to receive preferential prices 
the company participates in various rebate  cash discount and cooperative marketing programs offered by its vendors to support expenses associated with distributing and marketing the vendor s products 
these rebates and purchase discounts are generally influenced by sales volumes and are subject to change 
the company s distribution agreements are generally short term  subject to periodic renewal  and provide for termination by either party without cause upon to days notice 
the company s vendors generally warrant the products the company distributes and allow returns of defective products  including those returned to the company by its customers 
the company generally does not independently warrant the products it distributes  however  local laws may in some cases impose warranty obligations on the company 
the company s merchandising department recruits vendors and manages important aspects of its vendor relationships  such as purchasing arrangements  cooperative marketing initiatives  vendor sales force relationships  product training  monitoring of rebate programs and various contract terms and conditions 
customers the company s reseller customers currently include over  active value added reseller accounts vars located in the united states  canada  latin america and europe 
no single customer accounted for more than of the company s total net sales for the fiscal year ended june  the company generally targets two types of reseller customers 
table of contents 
index to financial statements specialty technology vars these resellers focus on selling specialty technology products as tailored software or integrated hardware solutions for their end users existing applications or incorporating specialty technology products into customized technology solutions for their end users 
primary industries served by these resellers include manufacturing  distribution  health care  pharmaceutical  hospitality  government  convenience  grocery  financial and other retail markets 
networking or pc vars these resellers develop computer solutions and networking for their end users microcomputer needs 
they typically have well established relationships with end user management information system directors and are seeking additional revenue and profit opportunities in related technology markets  such as aidc  pos  security or communications 
sales and electronic commerce the company s sales department consists primarily of inside sales representatives located in the united states  canada  mexico  brazil  belgium  france  germany  the united kingdom and the netherlands 
in order to build strong customer relationships  most active resellers are assigned to a sales representative 
each sales representative negotiates pricing directly with their assigned customers 
the company also employs business development representatives who are responsible for developing technical expertise within broad product markets  recruiting customers  creating demand  and reviewing overall product and service requirements of resellers 
each sales representative and business development representative receives comprehensive training with respect to the technical characteristics of each vendor s products 
this training is supplemented by frequent product seminars conducted by vendors representatives and bi weekly meetings among product  marketing and sales managers 
increasingly  customers rely upon the company s electronic ordering and information systems  in addition to its product catalogs and frequent mailings  as sources for product information  including availability and price 
through the company s website  most customers can gain remote access to the company s information systems to check real time product availability  see their customized pricing and place orders 
customers can also follow the status of their orders and obtain united parcel service ups and federal express fedex package tracking numbers from this site 
marketing the company provides a range of marketing services  including cooperative advertising with vendors through trade publications and direct mail  product catalogs for each of the north american  european and latin american markets  periodic newsletters  management of sales leads  trade shows with hardware and software companies and vendors  direct mail  and sales promotions 
in addition  the company organizes and operates its own seminars and teams with top vendors to recruit prospective resellers and introduce new applications for the specialty technology products it distributes 
the company frequently customizes its marketing services for vendors and resellers 
value added services in addition to the basic order fulfillment and credit services that conventional wholesale distributors typically provide to resellers  we differentiate ourselves by providing an array of value added services and business tools that assist resellers to provide more complete solutions and improve customer service 
such services include custom configuration  professional services  technical support  partner marketing  web storefronts  custom packaging  and other specialized services 
operations information system the company s information system is a scalable  centralized processing system capable of supporting numerous operational functions including purchasing  receiving  order processing  shipping  inventory management and accounting 
sales representatives rely on the information system for on line  real time information on product pricing  inventory availability and reservation  and order status 
the company s warehouse operations use bar code technology for receiving and shipping  and automated ups and fedex systems for freight processing and shipment tracking  each of which is integrated with the company s information system 
the customer service and technical support departments employ the system for documentation and faster processing of customer product returns 
to ensure that adequate inventory levels are maintained  the company s buyers depend on the system s purchasing and receiving functions to track inventory on a continual basis 

table of contents 
index to financial statements central warehouse and shipping we operate a  square foot distribution center in southaven  mississippi  which is located near the fedex hub facility in memphis  tennessee and serves all of north america 
our european operation utilizes a third party warehouse located in liege  belgium and leases office and warehouse space in cologne  germany that service all of europe  including the united kingdom 
subsequent to june   we have consolidated the european warehouse operations in belgium and are still servicing the lease in germany 
our latin american warehouses are located in florida  mexico and brazil 
our centralized distribution model creates several advantages  including i a reduced amount of safety stock inventory which  in turn  reduces the company s working capital requirements  ii an increased turnover rate through tighter controls over inventory  iii maintenance of a consistent order fill rate  iv improved personnel productivity  v improved delivery time  vi simplified purchasing and tracking  vii decreased demand for management personnel  and viii flexibility to meet customer needs for systems integration 
our objective is to ship all orders on the same day  using bar code technology to expedite shipments and minimize shipping errors 
the company offers reduced freight rates and flexible delivery options to minimize a reseller s need for inventory 
financial services our sales terms are competitive within our specific geographic areas for qualified resellers and facilitate various third party financing options  including leasing  flooring and other secured financing 
we believe this policy reduces the customer s need to establish multiple credit relationships with a large number of manufacturers 
competition the markets in which we operate is highly competitive 
competition is based primarily on factors such as price  product availability  speed and accuracy of delivery  effectiveness of sales and marketing programs  credit availability  ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs  quality and breadth of product lines and services  and availability of technical and product information 
our competitors include regional and national wholesale distributors  as well as hardware manufacturers including most of the company s vendors that sell directly to resellers and to end users 
in addition  our competitors include master resellers that sell to franchisees  third party dealers and end users 
certain current and potential competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than the company has and may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
certain smaller  regional competitors  who are specialty two tier or mixed model master resellers  may also be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
competition has increased for our sales units over the last several years as broad line and other value added distributors have entered into the specialty technology markets 
such competition could also result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share 
in our worldwide pos and barcoding sales units  the company competes with broad line distributors such as avnet  ingram micro and synnex in all geographic segments 
additionally  the company also competes against other smaller  more specialized aidc and pos distributors  such as azerty  bluestar  bp solutions  interway do brasil and nimax 
in our worldwide communications sales units  the company competes against other broad line distributors such as avnet  ingram micro and tech data and more specialized distributors such as jenne  nimans and westcon 
in our worldwide security sales units  the company competes against other broad line distributors such as ingram micro and tech data and more specialized distributors such as adi  anixter  istc and tri northern 
as the company seeks to expand its business into other areas closely related to the company s offerings  the company may encounter increased competition from current competitors and or from new competitors  some of which may be the company s current customers 
employees as of june   we had  employees located in north america  latin america and europe

risk factors 
the following are certain risk factors that could affect our business  financial position and results of operations 
these risks should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k because these factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
there also are other risks that we may not describe  generally because we currently do not perceive them to be material  which could impact us 
if any of these risks develops into actual events  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected  the market price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock 
we expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any risk factors  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise  except as required by law 
global economic instability current world wide economic conditions and market disruptions may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
financial markets throughout the world could experience extreme disruption  including  among other things  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations and pricing volatility of others  volatile energy costs  geopolitical issues and failure and potential failures of major financial institutions 
these developments and or a related general economic downturn may adversely impact our business and financial condition in a number of ways 
the slowdown could lead to reduced information technology spending by end users  which could adversely affect our sales 
the global economic downturn and instability may also result in changes in vendor terms and conditions  such as rebates  cash discounts and cooperative marketing efforts  which may result in downward pressure on our gross margins 
the tightening of credit in financial markets and the general economic downturn may adversely affect the ability of our reseller customers  vendors and service providers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and to perform their obligations under our agreements with them 
this could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services  could negatively impact our ability to collect our accounts receivable on a timely basis  could result in additional reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable being required  and could lead to elevated levels of obsolete inventory 
deterioration in the financial and credit market heightens the risk of customer bankruptcies and delay in payment 
while general economic conditions may have improved  there is no assurance that this trend will continue or at what rate 
significant volatility and fluctuations in the rates of exchange for the us dollar against currencies such as the euro  great british pound and the brazilian real could also negatively impact our customer pricing and operating results 
we continue to be unable to predict the duration of the current economic downturn and disruption in financial markets or their effects on our business and results of operations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements international operations our international operations expose us to risks that are different from  or possibly greater than  the risks we are exposed to domestically 
we currently have facilities in eight countries outside the united states and sell products in a number of others 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from our international operations 
these operations are subject to a variety of risks that are in addition to the risks that we face domestically or are similar risks but with potentially greater exposure 
these risks include changes in international trade laws  such as the north american free trade agreement  affecting our import and export activities  including export license requirements  restrictions on the export of certain technology  and tariff changes  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  changes in  or expiration of  various foreign incentives that provide economic benefits to us  changes in labor laws and regulations affecting our ability to hire and retain employees  difficulties in staffing and managing operations in foreign countries  fluctuations of foreign currency  exchange controls and currency devaluations  changes in the interpretation and enforcement of laws in particular related to items such as duty and taxation  potential political and economic instability and changes in governments  terrorist or military actions that result in destruction or seizure of our assets or suspension or disruption of our operations or those of our customers  potential regulatory changes  including foreign environmental restrictions  and different general economic conditions 
because we have operations in brazil  canada  mexico and europe  we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
exchange rate fluctuations may cause our international results to fluctuate significantly when reflected in us dollar terms 
we manage our exposure to fluctuations in the value of currencies using various derivative instruments 
however  we may not be able to mitigate all foreign currency related risk 
developing economies  such as brazil  could have sudden and drastic changes in foreign exchange rates compared to others 
in addition  in foreign markets we are more dependent upon third party providers of key services  such as third party freight forwarders and third party warehouses in europe and latin america 
adverse changes in any of these third party services could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
as we expand our international operations  we expect these risks to increase 
in addition  the value of our equity investment in foreign countries may fluctuate based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these fluctuations may result in losses in the event a foreign subsidiary is sold or closed at a time when the foreign currency is weaker than when we initially invested 
brazilian operations we face special political  economic and regulatory risks by doing business in brazil  which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
as a result of our april acquisition of all of the shares of cdc  we have substantial operations in brazil and face risks related to that country s complex tax  labor  trade compliance and consumer protection laws and regulations 
we may now have exposure to the complex tax structure in brazil  where we have noted that several other companies have had issues with brazilian tax authorities that have impacted earnings 
additionally  developing markets such as brazil have greater political volatility  greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and are more likely than mature countries to experience market  currency and interest rate fluctuations and may have higher inflation 
any of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  in developing markets it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us  such as the foreign corrupt practices act or similar local anti bribery laws 
these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees  contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in addition  competition in developing markets such as brazil is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations 
our success in integrating cdc s operations is critical to our growth strategy 
if we cannot successfully increase our business in brazil  our product sales  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
systems and the transition to new enterprise resource planning system our ability to manage our business and monitor results is highly dependent upon information and communication systems 
a failure of these systems or the erp implementation could disrupt our business 
we are highly dependent upon a variety of internal computer and telecommunication systems to operate our business  including our enterprise resource planning erp systems 
in order to continue support of our growth  we are making significant technological upgrades to our information systems 
we are in the process of implementing a company wide  single erp software system and related processes to perform various functions and improve on the efficiency of our global business 
we began committing resources to this effort in fiscal this will be a lengthy and expensive process that will result in a diversion of resources from other operations 
we are following a project plan that we believe provides for a reasonable allocation of resources for this effort 
however  execution of the plan  or a divergence from it  may result in cost overruns  project delays or business interruptions 
in addition  divergence from our project plan could impact the timing and or extent of benefits we expect to achieve from the system and process efficiencies 
any disruptions  delays or deficiencies in the design and or implementation of the new erp system  or in the performance of our legacy systems  particularly any disruptions  delays or deficiencies that impact our operations  could adversely affect our ability to effectively run and manage our business and potentially for our customers to access our price and product availability information 
further  as we are dependent upon our ability to gather and promptly transmit accurate information to key decision makers  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if our information systems do not allow us to transmit accurate information  even for a short period of time 
failure to properly or adequately address these issues could impact our ability to perform necessary business operations  which could adversely affect our reputation  competitive position  business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the information systems of companies we acquire may not be sufficient to meet our standards or we may not be able to successfully convert them to provide acceptable information on a timely and cost effective basis 
furthermore  we must attract and retain qualified people to operate our systems  expand and improve them  integrate new programs effectively with our existing programs  and convert to new systems efficiently when required 
any disruption to our business due to such issues  or an increase in our costs to cover these issues that is greater than what we have anticipated  could have an adverse affect on our financial results and operations 
our customers rely increasingly on our electronic ordering and information systems as a source for product information  including availability and pricing 
there can be no assurance that our systems will not fail or experience disruptions  and any significant failure or disruption of these systems could prevent us from making sales  ordering and delivering products and otherwise conducting our business 
many of our customers use our website to check real time products availability  see their customized pricing and to place orders 
the internet and individual websites have experienced a number of disruptions and slowdowns 
in addition  some websites have experienced security breakdowns 
while our website has not experienced any material disruptions or security breakdowns  any disruptions or breaches in security or a breach that compromises sensitive information could harm our relationship with our vendors  customers and other business partners 
any material disruption of our website or the internet in general could impair our order processing or prevent our vendors and customers from accessing information and cause us to lose business 
vendor relationships terminations of a distribution or services agreement or a significant change in supplier terms  authorizations  or lack of product availability  or conditions of sale could negatively affect our operating margins  revenue or the level of capital required to fund our operations 
a significant percentage of our net sales relates to products sold to us by relatively few vendors 
as a result of such concentration risk  terminations of supply or services agreements or a significant change in terms or conditions of sale from one or more of our more significant vendors could negatively affect our operating margins  revenues or the level of capital required to fund our operations 
our vendors have the ability to make significantly adverse changes in their sales terms and conditions  such as reducing the level of purchase discounts and rebates they make available to us 
we have no guaranteed price or delivery agreements with our significant vendors 
in certain product categories  limited price protection or return rights offered by our vendors may have a bearing on the amount of product we may be willing to stock 
our inability to pass through to our reseller customers the impact of these changes  as well as our failure to develop systems to manage ongoing vendor programs  could cause us to record inventory write downs or other losses and could have significant negative impact on our gross margins 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we receive purchase discounts and rebates from some vendors based on various factors  including goals for quantitative and qualitative sales or purchase volume and customer related metrics 
certain purchase discounts and rebates may affect gross margins 
many purchase discounts from vendors are based on percentage increases in sales of products 
our operating results could be negatively impacted if these rebates or discounts are reduced or eliminated or if our vendors significantly increase the complexity of process and costs for us to receive such rebates 
our ability to obtain particular products or product lines in the required quantities and our ability to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis is critical to our success 
our manufacturers have experienced product supply shortages from time to time due to the inability of certain suppliers to supply certain products on a timely basis 
as a result  we have experienced  and may in the future continue to experience  short term shortages of specific products 
in addition  vendors who currently distribute their products through us may decide to shift to or substantially increase their existing distribution  through other distributors  their own dealer networks  or directly to resellers or end users 
suppliers have  from time to time  made efforts to reduce the number of distributors with which they do business 
this could result in more intense competition as distributors strive to secure distribution rights with these vendors  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
if vendors are not able to provide us with an adequate supply of products to fulfill our customer orders on a timely basis or we cannot otherwise obtain particular products or a product line or vendors substantially increase their existing distribution through other distributors  their own dealer networks  or directly to resellers  our reputation  sales and profitability may suffer 
people if we cannot continue to hire and retain high quality employees  our business and financial results may be negatively affected 
our operating results could be adversely affected by increased competition for employees  higher employee turnover  or increased salary and benefit costs 
like most businesses  our employees are important to our success and we are dependent in part on our ability to retain the services of our key management  sales  it  operational  finance and administrative personnel 
we have built our business on a set of core values and we attempt to hire employees who are committed to these values 
we want employees who will fit our culture of providing exceptional service to our vendors and customers 
in order to compete and to continue to grow  we must attract  retain  and motivate employees  including those in executive  senior management  sales  marketing  logistics  technical support and other operating positions 
many of our employees work in small teams to provide specific services to vendors and customers 
they are trained to develop their knowledge of vendor products  programs and practices  and customer business needs  as well as to enhance the skills required to provide exceptional service and to manage our business 
as they gain experience and develop their knowledge and skills  our employees become highly desired by other businesses 
therefore  to retain our employees  we have to provide a satisfying work environment and competitive compensation and benefits 
if our costs to retain our skilled employees increase  then our business and financial results may be negatively affected 
our continued growth is also dependent  in part  on the skills  experience and efforts of our senior management  including but not limited to  michael baur  our chief executive officer 
we may not be successful in retaining the members of our senior management team or our other key employees 
while we have entered into employment agreements with key executives and have obtained a key person life insurance policy on our ceo s life  the loss of the services of mr 
baur or any member of our senior management team could also have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
customer relationships we operate in a highly competitive environment and good customer relations are critical to our success 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain and expand our customer relationships or acquire new customers 
meeting our customers needs quickly and fairly is critical to our business success 
our transactions with our customers are generally performed on a purchase order basis rather than under long term supply agreements 
our customers generally do not have an obligation to purchase from us 
therefore  our customers can readily switch vendors 
from time to time  we experience shortages in availability of some products from vendors  and this impacts our customers decisions regarding whether to make purchases from us 
anything that negatively impacts our customer relations also can negatively impact our operating results 
accordingly  our sales can vary as a result of fluctuations in pricing  product availability  and general competitive and economic conditions 
credit exposure we have credit exposure to our reseller customers 
any adverse trends in their businesses could cause us to suffer credit losses 
we have credit exposure to our reseller customers and negative trends in their businesses could increase our credit risk 
as is customary in our industry  we extend credit to our reseller customers  and most of our sales are on open accounts 
we may be unable to collect on receivables if our reseller customers experience decreases in demand for their products and services  do not manage their businesses adequately  or otherwise become less able to pay due to adverse economic conditions 
as we grow and compete for business  our typical payment terms tend to be longer  and therefore may increase our credit risk 

table of contents 
index to financial statements while we evaluate our resellers qualifications for credit and monitor our extensions of credit  these efforts cannot prevent all credit losses  and credit losses in excess of historical levels would negatively impact our performance 
in addition  for financial reporting purposes we estimate future credit losses and establish an appropriate reserve 
to the extent that our credit losses exceed those reserves  our financial performance will be negatively impacted 
there is no guarantee that our operating expenses will not increase as a result of the recognition of bad debt expense from our reseller customers 
centralized functions we have centralized a number of functions to provide efficient support to our business 
as a result  a loss or reduction of use of one of our locations could have an adverse effect on our business operations and financial results 
in order to be as efficient as possible  we centralize a number of critical functions 
for instance  we currently distribute products in north america from a single warehouse near memphis  tennessee with corresponding arrangements for our latin american and european markets 
similarly  we utilize a single information system based in greenville  south carolina  and cdc currently utilizes its existing information system in brazil 
while we have backup systems and business continuity plans  any significant or lengthy interruption of our ability to provide these centralized functions could significantly impair our ability to continue normal business operations 
in addition  the centralization of these functions increases our exposure to local risks  such as the availability of qualified employees and the lessening of competition for critical services  such as freight and communications 
although we have business interruption insurance  not all losses are covered  and an uninsured loss from electrical or telephone failure  fire or other casualty  or other disruption could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  there are limits on all of our insurance coverage  and it is possible that losses might exceed that coverage 
narrow profit margins our narrow margins significantly impact our operating results 
our industry is highly competitive and characterized by narrow gross and operating margins 
as a result  we have significant price competition that results in narrow gross profit and operating profit margins 
because these margins are narrow  fluctuations in sales can have a significant impact on our overall operating results 
inventory the value of our inventory may be adversely affected by market and other factors 
our business  like that of other distributors  is subject to the risk that the value of our inventory will be adversely affected by price reductions by manufacturers or by technological changes affecting the usefulness or desirability of our products 
under the terms of most of our vendor agreements and the policy of most manufacturers of specialty technology products  we have some price protection and stock rotation opportunities with respect to slow moving or obsolete inventory items 
however  these protections are limited in scope and do not protect against all declines in inventory value  excess inventory  or product obsolescence  and in some instances we may not be able to fulfill all necessary conditions or successfully manage such price protection or stock rotation opportunities 
in addition  these industry practices are sometimes not reflected in vendor agreements and their application in a particular situation is dependent upon negotiations between our vendors and us 
as a result  from time to time we are required to write down the value of excess and obsolete inventory  and should any of these write downs occur at a significant level  they could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
should we experience an economic downturn  it is possible that prices may decline due to an oversupply of product  and therefore  there may be a greater risk of declines in inventory value 
in addition  our vendors may become insolvent and unable to fulfill their product obligations to us 
significant declines in inventory value in excess of established inventory reserves or dramatic changes in prevailing technologies could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements competition we experience intense competition in all of our markets 
such competition could result in reduced margins and loss of our market share 
the markets that we operate in are highly competitive 
we compete on the basis of price  product availability  speed and accuracy of delivery  effectiveness of sales and marketing programs  credit availability  ability to tailor solutions to the needs of our customers  quality and breadth of product line and services  and availability of technical and product information 
our competitors include regional and national wholesale distributors as well as hardware manufacturers including most of our vendors that sell directly to resellers and to end users 
in addition  we compete with master resellers that sell to franchisees  third party dealers and end users 
certain of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we have and may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
certain smaller  regional competitors  who are specialty two tier or mixed model master resellers  may also be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
competition has increased for our sales units as broad line and other value added distributors have entered into the specialty technology markets 
such competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of our market share 
as a result of intense price competition in our industry  our gross margins and our operating profit margins have historically been narrow and we expect them to be narrow in the future 
to remain competitive we may be forced to offer more credit or extended payment terms to our customers 
this could result in an increase in our need for capital  increase our financing costs  increase our bad debt expenses and have a negative impact on our financial results 
growth strategies if we fail to effectively manage and implement our organic growth strategies  we may experience a negative effect on our business and financial results 
a significant component of our growth strategy has been to add new vendors and products  and we expect to be able to enter new product markets in the future 
expansion of our existing product markets and entry into new product markets divert the use of our resources and systems  require additional resources that might not be available or available on acceptable terms  result in new or more intense competition  may require longer implementation times or greater start up expenditures than anticipated  and may otherwise fail to achieve the desired results in a timely fashion  if at all 
in addition  while we have been very successful in adding new vendors in the past  we already represent most of the significant vendors in our primary areas of focus  and there is regular consolidation among our vendors 
as a result  there may be fewer expansion opportunities of this nature in the future 
if we are unable to increase our sales and earnings by expanding our product offerings in a cost effective manner  then our revenues may not grow 
our ability to successfully manage our growth will require continued enhancement of our operational  managerial  and financial resources and controls 
our failure to effectively manage our growth could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
additionally  our growth may increase our working capital requirements and as a result  we may require additional equity or debt financing 
such financing may not be available on terms that are favorable to us  if at all 
acquisitions our growth strategy includes potential acquisitions of companies that complement or expand our existing business 
acquisitions involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
we have and expect to continue to acquire companies that complement or expand our business in the united states or internationally 
acquisitions may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management s attention away from normal business operations  sufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the acquisition  difficulty in the integration of acquired businesses  including new employees  business systems and technology  inability to adapt to challenges of new markets  including geographies  products and services  or to attract new sources of profitable business from expansion of products or services  exposure to new regulations  and issues not discovered in our due diligence process 
our operations may be adversely impacted by an acquisition that i is not suited for us  ii is improperly executed  or iii substantially increases our debt 
any of these factors could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources market factors may increase the cost and availability of capital 
additional capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms to fund our working capital needs and growth 
our business requires significant levels of capital to finance accounts receivable and product inventory that is not financed by trade creditors 
we have an increased demand for capital when our business is expanding  including through acquisitions 
changes in payment terms with either suppliers or customers could increase our capital requirements 
we have historically relied upon cash generated from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility  secured and unsecured borrowings  and  to a lesser extent  borrowings under a subsidiary s line of credit to satisfy our capital needs and to finance growth 
while we believe that our existing sources of liquidity will provide sufficient resources to meet our current working capital and cash requirements  if we require capital to meet our future business needs  such capital may not be available to us on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
changes in how lenders rate our credit worthiness  as well as macroeconomic factors such as the current economic downturn and global economic instability may restrict our ability to raise capital in adequate amounts or on terms acceptable to us  and the failure to do so could harm our ability to operate our business

index to financial statements in addition  our cash and cash equivalents are deposited with various financial institutions located in the various countries in which we operate 
we endeavor to monitor these financial institutions regularly for credit quality  however  we are exposed to risk of loss on such funds or we may experience significant disruptions in our liquidity needs if one or more of these financial institutions were to suffer bankruptcy or similar restructuring 
terrorist or military operations future terrorist or military operations could result in a disruption of our operation or loss of assets in certain markets 
future terrorist or military actions  in the united states or abroad  could result in destruction or seizure of assets or suspension or disruption of our operations 
additionally  such actions could affect the operations of our suppliers or customers  resulting in loss of access to products  potential losses on supplier programs  loss of business  higher losses on receivables or inventory  and or other disruptions in our business  which could negatively affect our operating results 
we do not carry broad insurance covering such terrorist or military actions  and even if we were to seek such coverage  the cost would likely be prohibitive 
laws and regulations changes in tax laws  and other laws and regulations may adversely impact us 
we are subject to a wide range of local  state and federal laws and regulations both in the united states and in the other countries in which we operate 
while we plan our operations based upon existing and anticipated laws and regulations  we cannot anticipate every change and can have only little  if any  impact on others 
we are particularly susceptible to changes in income and other tax laws  laws regulating international trade  and accounting and securities disclosure laws and regulations 
to a lesser degree  changes in environmental regulation  including electronic waste recovery legislation  may impact us 
in each case  a change in the laws or regulations that we are required to comply with could have an adverse impact on our business operations or financial results 
fair value accounting for contingent consideration changes in the fair value of the liability for the estimated remaining payments for the purchase of cdc could have a significant effect on our reported earnings 
the acquisition of cdc was structured having an upfront payment with five annual cash installments based upon the financial performance of cdc for the twelve month periods ended on june  through june  in accordance with asc  business combinations  a liability for the contingent consideration driven by an earn out must be recorded at the on set of the purchase and must be revalued at every reporting period 
changes in the fair value of the liability are recorded as an adjustment to operating income 
these changes can occur due to changes in estimated future financial results  the probabilities of achieving these results and the discount rate reflective of our creditworthiness and market risk premium associated with the brazilian market 
both gains and losses can occur due to changes in these fair value estimates  thus increasing volatility of our earnings 
accounting rules changes in accounting rules or standards could have a significant adverse affect on our reported earnings 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
these principles are subject to interpretations by various governing bodies including the financial accounting standards board  the public accounting oversight board  the sec and the american institute of certified public accountants 
these governing bodies create and interpret appropriate accounting standards 
future periodic assessments required by current or new accounting standards may result in additional non cash charges and or changes in presentation or disclosure 
a change from current accounting standards could have a significant adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
quarterly fluctuations our net sales and operating results are dependent on a number of factors 
our net sales may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and these fluctuations may cause volatility in our stock price 
our net sales and operating results may fluctuate quarterly as a result of changes in demand for our products and services  the introduction of new technology  actions by our competitors  changes in vendors prices or price protection policies  changes in vendors business practices or strategies  changes in freight rates  the timing of the addition of operating expenses to support our growth  the timing of major marketing or other service projects  product supply shortages  changes in product mix  and the general economic factors referenced above 
in addition  a substantial portion of our net sales in each quarter results from orders booked in that quarter  which are difficult to accurately forecast in advance 
as a result  our performance in one period may vary significantly from our performance in the preceding quarter  and may differ significantly from our forecast of performance from quarter to quarter 
the impact of these variances may cause volatility in our stock price

however  in order to continue to grow its markets  the company has invested in new initiatives including investments in new geographic markets of europe and latin america  increased marketing efforts to recruit resellers  enhancements of employee benefit plans to retain employees  and strategic acquisitions in both the north american and international distribution segments 
evaluating financial condition and operating performance the company s management places a significant emphasis on operating income and return on invested capital roic in evaluating and monitoring the company s financial condition and operating performance

the company generates interest income on longer term interest bearing receivables  and  to a much lesser extent  interest earned on cash and cash equivalent balances on hand 
net foreign exchange gains and losses consist of foreign currency transactional and functional currency re measurements  offset by net foreign currency exchange contract gains and losses 
foreign exchange losses and gains are generated as the result of fluctuations in the value of the euro versus the british pound  the us dollar versus other currencies and most recently between the brazilian real and the us dollar due to the acquisition of cdc

the increase in gross profit was primarily the result of higher sales volume in all of our sales units  as previously discussed 
while total gross profit for the north american distribution segment increased  gross profit  expressed as a percentage of net sales  actually decreased to for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to for the prior fiscal year 
this was largely the result of a less favorable product mix and higher margin dilution due to an increase of larger deals and projects that traditionally carry lower margins 
international distribution despite the increase in sales for the international distribution segment  gross profit actually decreased by million  or for the fiscal year ended june   as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the decline in gross profit for the fiscal year ended june  was primarily due to the absence of strategic inventory purchases in anticipation of subsequent vendor price increases in our european operating segment that occurred in the prior year

index to financial statements critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates  including those related to the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory reserves to reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market  and vendor incentives 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  however  management believes that its estimates  including those for the above described items are reasonable and that the actual results will not vary significantly from the estimated amounts 
for further discussion of our significant accounting policies  refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized once four criteria are met the company must have persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery must occur  which happens at the point of shipment this includes the transfer of both title and risk of loss  provided that no significant obligations remain  the price must be fixed and determinable  and collectability must be reasonably assured 
the company allows its customers to return product for exchange or credit subject to certain limitations 
a provision for estimated losses on returns is recorded based on historical experience 
service revenue associated with configuration and marketing services is recognized when the work is complete and the four criteria discussed above have been substantially met 
the company also distributes third party service contracts  typically for product maintenance and support 
since the company acts as an agent on behalf of most of these service contracts sold  revenue is recognized net of cost at the time of sale 
however  the company distributes some self branded warranty programs and engages a third party generally the original equipment manufacturer to cover the fulfillment of any obligations arising from these contracts 
these revenues and associated third party costs are amortized over the life of contract and presented in net sales and cost of goods sold  respectively 
service revenue associated with configuration  marketing  service contracts and other services has represented less than of consolidated net sales for fiscal years  and during the fiscal years ended june    and  the company has not engaged in any sales transactions involving multiple element arrangements 
had any arrangements with multiple deliverables occurred  the company would follow the guidance set forth in asc allowances for trade and notes receivable the company maintains an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from customers failure to make payments on accounts receivable due to the company 
management determines the estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable by considering a number of factors  including historical experience  aging of the accounts receivable and specific information obtained by the company on the financial condition and the current creditworthiness of its customers 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate and reduce the ability of the company s customers to make payments on their accounts  the company may be required to increase its allowance by recording additional bad debt expense 
likewise  should the financial condition of the company s customers improve and result in payments or settlements of previously reserved amounts  the company may be required to record a reduction in bad debt expense to reverse the recorded allowance 
a provision for estimated losses on returns and allowances is recorded on historical experience 
inventory reserves management determines the inventory reserves required to reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market based principally on the effects of technological changes  quantities of goods on hand  and other factors 
an estimate is made of the market value  less cost to dispose  of products whose value is determined to be impaired 
if these products are ultimately sold at less than estimated amounts  additional reserves may be required 
the estimates used to calculate these reserves are applied consistently 
the adjustments are recorded in the period in which the loss of utility of the inventory occurs  which establishes a new cost basis for the inventory 
this new cost basis is maintained until such time that the reserved inventory is disposed of  returned to the vendor or sold 
to the extent that specifically reserved inventory is sold  cost of goods sold is expensed for the new cost basis of the inventory sold

index to financial statements during fiscal  the company made strategic decisions to increase purchasing activity beyond our immediate needs  in light of known product constraints in multiple vendors supply chains and to strategically position our inventory levels to accommodate anticipated customer orders as the global macroeconomic environment was improving 
as a result  the company shifted its working capital position from an atypically large cash position in fiscal to inventory  accounts receivable and trade payables in fiscal during  the company continued to experience increased demand and accounts receivable continued to increase 
as such  inventory levels were expanded to meet higher demand levels and utilize favorable vendor pricing programs 
the company s working capital increased to million at june  from million at june  the million increase in working capital was primarily due to increased accounts receivables and inventory balances  partially offset by increased accounts payable  between the two periods in order to accommodate the record sales volumes achieved in fiscal as of june   there was million outstanding on the company s revolving line of credit 
there was no balance on the company s revolving line of credit facility at june  the number of days sales in receivables dso was at june   compared to days at june  and days at march  the cdc acquisition attributed approximately half a day increase in the dso for the period along with a slightly less favorable mix of customers with longer terms of sales 
inventory turnover decreased to times in the current fiscal year versus times in the comparative prior year period 
this decrease in turns was largely the function of higher average inventory balances carried during the fiscal year ended june   due to increased demand and capitalization on favorable inventory pricing programs offered by our vendors

these costs will be financed using cash flow from operations and the revolving credit facility

we had million outstanding at june  versus no borrowings outstanding at june  the average daily balance on the revolving credit facility was million throughout the current year versus million in the prior year

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s principal exposure to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of its business is a result of its selective use of bank debt and transacting business in foreign currencies in connection with its foreign operations 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing activities  which include revolving credit facilities with a group of banks used to maintain liquidity and fund the company s business operations 
the nature and amount of the company s debt may vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in interest rates on borrowings on the company s revolving credit facility  variable rate long term debt and subsidiary line of credit for the fiscal year ended june  would have resulted in a less than million increase or decrease  respectively  in pre tax income for the period 
to mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations associated with the company s variable rate long term debt  the company has implemented an interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of an interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge to minimize the significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility 
the company s use of derivative instruments has the potential to expose the company to certain market risks including the possibility of the company s hedging activities not being as effective as anticipated in reducing the volatility of the company s cash flows  the counterparty not performing its obligations under the applicable hedging arrangement  the hedging arrangement being imperfect or ineffective  or the terms of the swap or associated debt may change 
the company seeks to lessen such risks by having established a policy to identify  control  and manage market risks which may arise from changes in interest rates  as well as limiting its counterparties to major financial institutions
