there are no other significant loan concentrations in the loan portfolio 
the company has certain lending policies and procedures in place that are designed to maximize loan income within an acceptable level of risk 
management reviews and approves these policies and procedures on a regular basis

critical accounting policy in the ordinary course of business  the company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to reporting the results of operations and financial condition in preparing its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes the following discussion addresses the company s only critical accounting policy  which is the policy that is most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and requires management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company has reviewed this critical accounting policy and estimates with its audit committee 
refer to the discussion below under allowance for loan losses and note to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of our estimation process and methodology related to the allowance for loan losses 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
the allowance consists of allocated and general components 
the allocated component relates to loans that are considered impaired 
for such impaired loans  an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows or observable market price or collateral value if the loan is collateral dependent of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan 
the general component covers all other loans  segregated generally by loan type and further segregated by risk rating  and is based on historical loss experience with adjustments for qualitative factors which are made after an assessment of internal or external influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss data 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value  and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record  and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial and real estate loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s obtainable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
impaired loans also include loans modified in troubled debt restructurings where concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties 
these concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate on the loan  payment extensions  forgiveness of principal  forbearance or other actions intended to maximize collection 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
accordingly  the company does not separately identify individual consumer loans for impairment disclosures  unless such loans are the subject of a restructuring agreement due to financial difficulties of the borrower 
the allowances established for losses on specific loans are based on a regular analysis and evaluation of problem loans 
loans are classified based on an internal credit risk rating process that evaluates  among other things i the borrower s ability to repay  ii the underlying collateral  if any  and iii the economic environment and industry in which the borrower operates 
this analysis is performed by the credit department  in consultation with the loan officers  for all commercial loans 
specific valuation allowances are determined by analyzing the borrower s ability to repay amounts owed  collateral deficiencies  the relative risk grade of the loan and economic conditions affecting the borrower s industry  among other things 
historical valuation allowances are calculated based on the historical loss experience of specific types of loans 
the company calculates historical loss ratios for pools of similar loans with similar characteristics based on the proportion of actual charge offs experienced to the total population of loans in the pool 
due to the small asset size and loans outstanding of the company  the company uses readily available data from the fdic which includes the loss experience of national banks with assets between million and million and combines the data with the company s actual loss experience 
the historical loss ratios are periodically updated based on actual charge off experience 
a historical valuation allowance is established for each pool of similar loans based upon the product of the historical loss ratio and the total dollar amount of the loans in the pool 
the company s pools of similar loans include similarly risk graded groups of commercial and industrial loans  commercial real estate loans  consumer real estate loans and consumer and other loans 
general valuation allowances are based on general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors  both internal and external  to the company 
in general  such valuation allowances are determined by evaluating  among other things i the experience  ability and effectiveness of the bank s lending management and staff  ii the effectiveness of the company s loan policies  procedures and internal controls  iii changes in asset quality  iv changes in loan portfolio volume  v the composition and concentrations of credit  and viii the impact of national and local economic trends and conditions 
management evaluates the degree of risk that each one of these components has on the quality of the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis 
each component is determined to have either a high  moderate or low degree of risk 
the results are then inputted into a general allocation matrix to determine an appropriate general valuation allowance 
based upon this evaluation  management believes the allowance for loan losses of  or of gross loans outstanding at december  is adequate  under prevailing economic conditions  to absorb losses on existing loans 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was  or of gross loans outstanding 
the increase in the allowance was attributable to a  increase in the general component of the allowance that was partially offset by a  decrease in the specific component of the allowance 
the decrease in the specific component of the allowance was due to a decrease in specific reserves totaling  for loans charged off during the year that were classified as impaired at december  and  for loans that were impaired at both december  and december  this decline was partially offset by an increase in specific reserves totaling  for three loans two commercial and industrial loans and one commercial real estate loan identified as impaired during the year ended december  the increase in the general component of the reserve was primarily due to increased loan volume  partially offset by a decrease in reserve factors 
the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time the loan is days past due unless the loan is well secured and in process of collection 
consumer installment loans are typically charged off no later than days past due 
past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan 
in all cases  loans are placed on nonaccrual status or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful 
all interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on nonaccrual status or charged off is reversed against interest income 
the interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash basis method until qualifying for return to accrual status 
loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured 
management considers all non accrual loans and troubled debt restructured loans to be impaired 
in most cases  loan payments that are past due less than days and the related loans are not considered to be impaired

non interest bearing deposits were million at december   a slight increase of million from million at december  total interest bearing checking  money market and savings deposits increased million or to million at december  from million at december  time deposits increased to million at december  from million at december   a million or increase 
included in time deposits at december  and december  were million and million  respectively  in brokered deposits 
this included the company s placement of million and million  respectively  in customer deposits  and purchase of million and million  respectively  in brokered certificates of deposit through the cdars program 
the cdars program offers the bank both reciprocal and one way swap programs which allow customers to enjoy additional fdic insurance for deposits that might not otherwise be eligible for fdic insurance and gives the bank additional access to funding 
the bank maintains relationships with several deposit brokers and could continue to utilize the services of one or more of these brokers if management determines that issuing brokered certificates of deposit would be in the best interest of the bank and the company 
the greater new haven market is highly competitive 
the bank faces competition from a large number of banks ranging from small community banks to large international banks  credit unions  and other providers of financial services 
the level of rates offered by the bank reflects the high level of competition in our market 
at december   the bank s maturities of time deposits were less than thousands of dollars or greater totals due within three months or less over three months to six months over six months to one year over one year to two years over two years to three years over three years other the decrease in other assets of  was due mainly to a decline in the balance of fdic insurance premiums the company was required to prepay in december this reduction in prepaid fdic insurance premiums resulted from offsetting amounts due for fdic assessments against the prepaid balance 
results of operations the company s net loss for fiscal year was  or basic and diluted loss per share of  compared to a net loss of  or basic and diluted loss per share of in fiscal year the company s net losses for the years ended december  and were largely attributable to provision for loan losses of  and  respectively 
the provision for loan losses during and was related to a group of four and ten impaired loans  respectively  that have been severely impacted by prevailing economic conditions  discussed in more detail under allowance for loan losses 
the company s net loss for the year ended december  was lower as compared to the same period in due to a  increase in net interest income recorded by the bank to reach a balance of  for the year ended december   compared to net interest income of  for the same period in net interest income increased due to increases in asset volumes particularly growth in the loan portfolio  higher yields on interest earning assets attributable to an increase in average balances of interest earning assets and lower costs on interest bearing liabilities  which were partially offset by increases in liability volumes 
in addition to the impact of the provision for loan losses and growth in the loan portfolio  the operating results for the year ended december   compared to the same period of  were influenced by the following factors noninterest income decreased because of decreases in service charges and fees resulting from changes in the business practices of customers of the bank 
these decreases were partially offset by recognition of a gain on the sale of an available for sale security  as well as increases in rental income 
noninterest expenses decreased due to lower salaries and benefits expense in compared to  as well as reimbursement by naugatuck valley financial corporation in of a portion of legal and professional fees incurred relating to the company s proposed merger with naugatuck valley financial corporation 
the proposed merger was mutually terminated by the merger parties on november  due to an inability to obtain regulatory approval of the transaction 
in addition  in noninterest expenses included an impairment write down of goodwill relating to evergreen in the amount of approximately  there were no similar impairment write downs in net interest income the principal source of revenue for the bank is net interest income 
the bank s net interest income is dependent primarily upon the difference or spread between the average yield earned on loans receivable and securities and the average rate paid on deposits and borrowings  as well as the relative amounts of such assets and liabilities 
the bank  like other banking institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different times  or on a different basis  than its interest earning assets 
for the year ended december   net interest income was  versus  for the same period in the  or increase was the result of a  increase in interest income and a  decrease in interest expense 
this net increase was primarily the result of increased asset volumes particularly growth in the loan portfolio 
higher yields on interest earning assets attributable to increases in average balances of interest earning assets  as well as favorable changes in rates on interest bearing liabilities  were partially offset by increased average balances on interest bearing liabilities 
the increase in the yield on average earning assets reflects the growth in the bank s loan portfolio combined with the impact of reductions in interest income related to the increase in non performing assets 
the company s average total interest earning assets were million for the period ended december   compared to million for the same period in  an increase of million or 
the increase in average interest earning assets of million was comprised of increases in average balances of loans of million  partially offset by decreases in average balances of short term and other investments of million 
the yield on average interest earning assets for the period ended december  was compared to for the same period in  an increase of basis points 
the increase in the yield on average earning assets was attributable to growth in the bank s higher yielding loan portfolio and reductions in lower yielding short term investments 
the combined effects of the million increase in average balances of interest earning assets and the basis point increase in yield on average interest earning assets resulted in the  increase in interest income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the average balance of the company s interest bearing liabilities was million for the period ended december  compared to million for the period ended december   an increase of million or 
the cost of average interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in  which was primarily due to a general decrease in market interest rates

the bank will seek opportunities through marketing to increase its deposit base  with a primary objective of attracting core non interest checking and related money market deposit accounts  in order to support its earning assets and through the consideration of additional branch locations and new product and service offerings

off balance sheet arrangements see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for required disclosure regarding off balance sheet arrangements 
liquidity the company s liquidity position as of december  and consisted of liquid assets totaling million and million  respectively 
this represents and of total assets at december  and  respectively 
the liquidity ratio is defined as the percentage of liquid assets to total assets 
the following categories of assets as described in the accompanying balance sheet are considered liquid assets cash and due from banks  short term investments  interest bearing certificates of deposit and securities available for sale 
liquidity is a measure of the company s ability to generate adequate cash to meet financial obligations 
the principal cash requirements of a financial institution are to cover downward fluctuations in deposits and increases in its loan portfolio 
management believes the company s short term assets provide sufficient liquidity to cover potential fluctuations in deposit accounts and loan demand and to meet other anticipated operating cash and investment requirements 
capital the following table illustrates the company s and bank s regulatory capital ratios at december  and company bank capital capital adequacy adequacy target ratio target ratio total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier leverage capital ratio to average assets capital adequacy is one of the most important factors used to determine the safety and soundness of individual banks and the banking system 
based on the above ratios  the bank is considered to be well capitalized under applicable regulations 
to be considered well capitalized an institution must generally have a leverage capital ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
market risk market risk is defined as the sensitivity of income to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices  commodity prices and other market driven rates or prices 
based upon the nature of the company s business  market risk is primarily limited to interest rate risk  which is defined as the impact of changing interest rates on current and future earnings 
the company s goal is to maximize long term profitability  while minimizing its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
the first priority is to structure and price the company s assets and liabilities to maintain an acceptable interest rate spread  while reducing the net effect of changes in interest rates 
in order to reach an acceptable interest rate spread  the company must generate loans and seek acceptable long term investments to replace the lower yielding balances in federal funds sold and short term investments 
the focus also must be on maintaining a proper balance between the timing and volume of assets and liabilities re pricing within the balance sheet 
one method of achieving this balance is to originate variable loans for the portfolio to offset the short term re pricing of the liabilities 
in fact  a number of the interest bearing deposit products have no contractual maturity 
customers may withdraw funds from their accounts at any time and deposits balances may therefore run off unexpectedly due to changing market conditions 
the exposure to interest rate risk is monitored by senior management of the bank and reported quarterly to the asset and liability management committee and the board of directors 
management reviews the interrelationships within the balance sheet to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of risk 
impact of inflation and changing prices the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effect of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
notwithstanding this fact  inflation can directly affect the value of loan collateral  in particular  real estate 
inflation  or disinflation  could significantly affect the company s earnings in future periods 
factors affecting future results some of the statements under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  business and elsewhere in this annual report on form k may include forward looking statements which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
statements which include the words expect  intend  plan  believe  project  anticipate and similar statements of a future or forward looking nature identify forward looking statements for purposes of the federal securities laws or otherwise 
all forward looking statements address matters that involve risks and uncertainties 
accordingly  there are or will be important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these statements or that could adversely affect the holders of our common stock 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in prevailing interest rates which would affect the interest earned on the company s interest earning assets and the interest paid on its interest bearing liabilities  the timing of re pricing of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the effect of changes in governmental monetary policy  the impact of recently enacted federal legislation and the effect of changes in regulations applicable to the company and the conduct of its business  changes in competition among financial service companies  including possible further encroachment of non banks on services traditionally provided by banks  the ability of competitors which are larger than the company to provide products and services which are impractical for the company to provide  the volatility of quarterly earnings  due in part to the variation in the number  dollar volume and profit realized from sba guaranteed loan participation sales in different quarters  the effect of a loss of any executive officer  key personnel  or directors  the effect of the company s opening of branches and the receipt of regulatory approval to complete such actions  the concentration of the company s business in southern and southeastern connecticut  the concentration of the company s loan portfolio in commercial loans to small to medium sized businesses  which may be impacted more severely than larger businesses during periods of economic weakness  lack of seasoning in the company s loan portfolio  which may increase the risk of future credit defaults  and the effect of any decision by the company to engage in any business not historically permitted to it 
other such factors may be described in other filings made by the company with the sec 
although the company believes that it has the resources needed for success  future revenues and interest spreads and yields cannot be reliably predicted 
these trends may cause the company to adjust its operations in the future 
because of the foregoing and other factors  recent trends should not be considered reliable indicators of future financial results or stock prices
