the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the financial information in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is presented in thousands of dollars  except for share and per share amounts 
general we offer products and services ranging from portable and standby power solutions to communications and electronics systems 
through our engineering and collaborative approach to problem solving  we serve government  defense and commercial customers across the globe 
we design  manufacture  install and maintain power and communications systems including rechargeable and non rechargeable batteries  standby power systems  communications and electronics systems and accessories  and custom engineered systems  solutions and services 
we sell our products worldwide through a variety of trade channels  including original equipment manufacturers oems  industrial and retail distributors  national retailers and directly to us and international defense departments 
beginning january   we now report our results in three operating segments instead of four battery energy products  communications systems  and energy services 
this change in segment reporting is more consistent with how we now manage our business operations 
the non rechargeable products and rechargeable products segments have been combined into a single segment called battery energy products 
the communications systems segment now includes our redblack communications business  which was previously included in the design installation services segment 
the design installation services segment has been renamed energy services and encompassed our standby power and wireless businesses 
research  design and development contract revenues and expenses  which were previously included in the design installation services segment  have been captured under the respective operating segment in which the work is performed 
the battery energy products segment includes lithium volt  cylindrical and various other non rechargeable batteries  in addition to rechargeable batteries  uninterruptable power supplies and accessories  such as cables 
the communications systems segment includes power supplies  cable and connector assemblies  rf amplifiers  amplified speakers  equipment mounts  case equipment  integrated communication system kits  charging systems and communications and electronics systems design 
the energy services segment includes standby power and systems design  installation and maintenance activities 
we look at our segment performance at the gross margin level  and we do not allocate research and development  except for research  design and development contracts as noted above  or selling  general and administrative costs against the segments 
all other items that do not specifically relate to these three segments and are not considered in the performance of the segments are considered to be corporate charges 

table of contents we continually evaluate ways to grow  including opportunities to expand through mergers  acquisitions and joint ventures  which can broaden the scope of our products and services  expand operating and market opportunities and provide the ability to enter new lines of business synergistic with our portfolio of offerings 
in march  we formed a joint venture  the india jv  with our distributor partner in india 
the india jv assembles ultralife power solution products and manages local sales and marketing activities  serving commercial  government and defense customers throughout india 
we have invested in cash into the india jv  as consideration for our ownership stake in the india jv 
in june  we changed our corporate name from ultralife batteries  inc to ultralife corporation 
the purpose of the name change was to align our corporate name more closely with the business now being conducted by us  as we are no longer exclusively a battery manufacturing company 
on november   we acquired certain assets of use  a nationally recognized standby power installation and power management services business 
use is located in riverside  california 
under the terms of the agreement  the initial purchase price consisted of  in cash 
in addition  on the achievement of certain post acquisition financial milestones  we were to issue up to an aggregate amount of  unregistered shares of our common stock  over a period of four years 
in april  we entered in an amendment agreement  where we agreed to issue  unregistered shares of our common stock in full satisfaction of our outstanding obligation under the asset purchase agreement 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
on march   we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the liabilities of the tactical communications products business of science applications international corporation 
the tactical communications products business amti  located in virginia beach  virginia  designs  develops and manufactures tactical communications products including amplifiers  man portable systems  cables  power solutions and ancillary communications equipment 
under the terms of the asset purchase agreement for amti  the purchase price consisted of  in cash 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
on june   the board of directors appointed john c 
casper as our vice president of finance and chief financial officer  succeeding robert w 
fishback 
in november  mr 
casper resigned from his position 
in december  philip a 
fain was appointed chief financial officer and treasurer  succeeding mr 
casper 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed an impairment analysis of the goodwill  intangible assets  and other long lived assets associated with the standby power business included in the energy services segment 
as a result of this analysis  in connection with the overall decrease in revenues in compared to and the declining gross margins over the last two years for the standby power business  we recognized a non cash impairment charge of  in the fourth quarter of to fully write off the goodwill and intangible assets and partially write off certain fixed assets 
see note in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information 
in december  pursuant to the terms of the addendum to his employment agreement dated may   john d 
kavazanjian notified us of his intention to retire  ceasing to serve as president and chief executive officer effective december  on december   michael d 
popielec was appointed president and chief executive officer effective december   succeeding john d 
kavazanjian 
on march   our senior management  as authorized by our board of directors  decided to exit our energy services business 
as a result of management s ongoing review of our business segments and products  and taking into account the growth and profitability potential of the energy services segment as well as its sizeable operating losses over the last several years  we determined it was appropriate to refocus our operations on profitable growth opportunities presented in our other segments  battery energy products and communications systems 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of  to write off the goodwill and intangible assets and certain fixed assets associated with the standby power portion of our energy services business 
we anticipate that the actions taken to exit our energy services business will result in the elimination of approximately jobs and the closing of five facilities  primarily in california  florida and texas  over several months 
we expect to complete all exit activities with respect to our energy services segment by the end of the third quarter 
upon completion  we will reclassify our energy services segment as a discontinued operation 
in connection with the exit activities described above  we expect that we will record total restructuring charges of approximately  the majority of which are related to employee related costs  including termination benefits  lease termination costs and inventory and fixed asset write downs  of which approximately  will be recorded in the first quarter of the cash component of the aggregate charge is expected to be approximately  
table of contents currently  we do not experience significant seasonal sales trends in any of our operating segments  although sales to the us defense department and other international defense organizations can be sporadic based on the needs of those particular customers 
overview consolidated revenues for the year ended december  increased by  or  from the year ended december  this increase was primarily caused by increased revenues in our communications systems segment as a result of deliveries on the satcom on the move order received in may gross margin increased to as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended december   as opposed to for the year ended december  gross margin increased in our battery energy products and communications systems operating segments  partially offset by the decrease in the gross margin in our energy services operating segment 
gross margin as a percentage of total revenues for our battery energy products and communications systems segments during the year ended december  increased to and  respectively 
the primary reasons for the gross margin improvements were manufacturing efficiencies and higher selling prices realized for some of our products in our battery energy products segment and a favorable mix of high margin communications systems revenue  including strong satcom on the move and amti amplifier revenues 
operating expenses increased to  during the year ended december  compared to  during the year ended december  included in operating expenses for the year ended december  was a  non cash asset impairment charge to write off the goodwill and intangible assets and certain fixed assets associated with our standby power business included in our energy services segment 
adjusting for this charge  operating expenses for the year ended december  decreased by  compared to the year ended december  the across the board cost reduction and consolidation actions we commenced in the latter half of were primarily responsible for this improvement 
adjusted ebitda  defined as net income loss attributable to ultralife before net interest expense  provision benefit for income taxes  depreciation and amortization  plus minus expenses income that we do not consider reflective of our ongoing operations  amounted to  for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  see the section adjusted ebitda beginning on page for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income loss attributable to ultralife 
with continued cash flow generated from our operations and favorable improvements made to our balance sheet  the outstanding balance on our new credit facility was  at december  by comparison  at december   the outstanding revolver balance under our previous credit facility was  outlook management has updated its full year guidance for as a result of exiting the energy services business and reclassifying it as a discontinued operation when complete  management now expects to report revenue of approximately  from continuing operations 
excluding satcom system shipments in both periods  revenue is expected to grow by over operating income is expected to be no less than  excluding the energy services closing costs of approximately  representing an operating margin of 
this compares favorably to the operating margin of adjusting for the  non cash impairment charge 
management cautions that the timing of orders and shipments may cause variability in quarterly results

total revenues for the twelve months ended december  amounted to  an increase of  or from the  reported for the twelve months ended december  battery energy products revenues increased  or  from  last year to  this year 
the slight increase in battery energy products revenues was primarily attributable to higher demand for our rechargeable batteries  including automotive telematics batteries resulting from favorable economic conditions in the automotive industry  partially offset by lower battery sales to the us department of defense 
communications systems revenues increased  or  from  last year to  this year 
the increase in communications systems revenues was mainly due to deliveries on the satcom on the move communications systems order we received in may and amplifier sales resulting from our acquisition of amti on march  and continued favorable demand for these products 
energy services revenues decreased  or  from  last year to  this year 
the decrease in energy services revenues was mainly attributable to continued customer delays in capital expenditures for backup stationary power  due to the continued weak economic conditions  primarily attributable to larger capital projects 
cost of products sold 
cost of products sold decreased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  consolidated cost of products sold as a percentage of total revenue decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  correspondingly  consolidated gross margin was for the year ended december   compared with for the year ended december   primarily attributable to the margin improvements in the battery energy products and communications systems business segments 
in our battery energy products segment  the cost of products sold decreased  from  in the year ended december  to  in battery energy products gross margin for was  or  an increase of  from s gross margin of  or 
battery energy products gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of revenues both increased for the year ended december   primarily as a result of manufacturing efficiencies and higher selling prices and volumes realized for some of our products  in comparison to the year ended december  in our communications systems segment  the cost of products sold increased  from  in to  in communications systems gross margin for was  or  an increase of  from s gross margin of  or 
the increase in both the gross margin and the gross margin percentage for communications systems resulted from deliveries on the satcom on the move communications systems order we received in may and from our acquisition of the amti amplifier business and increased sales of its higher margin products 

table of contents in our energy services segment  the cost of sales decreased  from  for the year ended december   to  in energy services gross margin for was  or  compared to s gross margin of  or 
gross margin and the gross margin percentage in this particular segment both decreased mainly due to lower sales caused by project delays and ongoing pricing pressures in this industry 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  overall  operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased to in from reported the prior year 
included in operating expenses for the year ended december  was a  non cash asset impairment charge to write off the goodwill and intangible assets and certain fixed assets associated with our energy services business 
adjusting for this charge  operating expenses for the year ended december  decreased by  compared to the year ended december  the across the board cost reduction and consolidation actions we commenced in the latter half of were primarily responsible for this improvement 
amortization expense associated with intangible assets related to our acquisitions was  for in selling  general and administrative expenses and in research and development costs  compared with  for  in selling  general  and administrative expenses and in research and development costs 
research and development costs were  in  a decrease of or  over the  reported in  with the decrease due to the timing of development projects relating primarily to advanced battery systems 
selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased  or  to  this decrease represents the results of our broad actions to reduce our overall spending base in non revenue producing functions  as well as approximately  of non recurring expenses that were recorded in the second quarter of associated with staff reductions and legal expenses relating to a litigation matter that was successfully resolved 
other income expense 
other income expense totaled for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  interest expense  net of interest income  decreased  from  for to  for  mainly as a result of lower average borrowings under our revolving credit facilities  partially offset by expenses related to the termination of our previous credit facility with jp morgan chase bank  na and manufacturers and traders trust company during the first quarter of the year 
miscellaneous income expense amounted to income of for compared with expense of for the income in was primarily due to the transactions impacted by changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
income taxes 
we reflected a tax benefit of for the twelve month period ended december  compared with a tax provision of in the same period of the tax benefit is principally a result of our realization of a current tax benefit related to our election in to carry back the net operating loss to the prior five tax years 
this amount was partially offset by state income taxes due for this election resulted in us receiving a refund of alternative minimum taxes paid in the prior five years 
in addition  we realized a deferred tax benefit as a result of the reassessment of the net required deferred tax liability 
this reassessment was required due to the impairment of certain goodwill and other intangible assets relating to the standby power business in the effective consolidated tax rate for the twelve month periods ended december  and was twelve month periods ended december  income loss before incomes taxes a total income tax provision benefit b effective tax rate b a in and  we continue to report a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets that cannot be offset by reversing temporary differences in the us  the us and china arising from the conclusion that we would not be able to utilize our us  us and china nol s that had accumulated over time 
the recognition of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset resulted from our evaluation of all available evidence  both positive and negative 
the assessment of the realizability of the nol s was based on a number of factors including  our history of net operating losses  the volatility of our earnings  our historical operating volatility  our historical ability to accurately forecast earnings for future periods and the continued uncertainty of the general business climate as of the end of we concluded that these factors represent sufficient negative evidence and have concluded that we should record a full valuation allowance under fasb s guidance on the accounting for income taxes 
see notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we continually assess the carrying value of this asset based on relevant accounting standards 

table of contents we have determined that a change in ownership  as defined under internal revenue code section  occurred in and as such  the domestic nol carryforward will be subject to an annual limitation estimated to be in the range of approximately  to  the unused portion of the annual limitation can be carried forward to subsequent periods 
our ability to utilize nol carryforwards due to the successive ownership changes is currently limited to a minimum of approximately  annually  plus the carryover from unused portions of the annual limitations 
we believe such limitation will not impact our ability to realize the deferred tax asset 
in addition  certain of our nol carryforwards are subject to us alternative minimum tax such that carryforwards can offset only of alternative minimum taxable income 
this limitation did not have an impact on income taxes determined for and the use of our uk nol carryforwards may be limited due to the change in the uk operation during from a manufacturing and assembly center to primarily a distribution and service center

net income loss attributable to ultralife 
net loss attributable to ultralife and loss attributable to ultralife common shareholders per diluted share were  and  respectively  for the year ended december   compared to net loss attributable to ultralife and loss attributable to ultralife common shareholders per diluted share of  and  respectively  for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the reasons described above 
average common shares outstanding used to compute diluted earnings per share increased from  in to  in  mainly due to the issuance of  shares of our common stock to the former principals of us energy under the amended purchase agreement in april twelve months ended december  compared with the twelve months ended december  months ended increase decrease revenues cost of products sold gross margin operating expenses operating income loss other income expense  net income loss before taxes income tax provision net income loss net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest net income loss attributable to ultralife net income loss attributable to ultralife common shares basic net income loss attributable to ultralife common shares diluted weighted average shares outstanding basic weighted average shares outstanding diluted revenues 
total revenues for the twelve months ended december  amounted to  a decrease of  or from the  reported for the twelve months ended december  battery energy products revenues decreased  or  from  last year to  this year 
the decrease in revenues was mainly attributable to a decline in sales to automotive telematics customers due to the recession  offset in part by higher shipments of our ba batteries to government defense customers and increased demand for rechargeable batteries and charging systems from us defense customers 
communications systems revenues decreased  or  from  last year to  this year 
the decrease in communications systems revenues was mainly attributable to large deliveries of satcom on the move systems in  which did not reoccur to the same extent in this decrease was partially offset by the acquisition of amti in march 
table of contents energy services revenues increased  or  from  last year to  this year 
the increase in energy services revenues was mainly attributable to the added revenue base provided from the acquisition of use in november cost of products sold 
cost of products sold decreased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the decrease in revenues 
consolidated cost of products sold as a percentage of total revenue increased from for the twelve months ended december  to for the year ended december  correspondingly  consolidated gross margins was for the year ended december   compared with for the year ended december   generally attributable to the margin decrease in the energy services segment  offset by improvements in the battery energy products and communications systems segments 
in our battery energy products segment  the cost of products sold decreased  from  in the year ended december  to  in battery energy products gross margin for was  or  an increase of  from s gross margin of  or 
battery energy products gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of revenues both increased for the year ended december   primarily as a result of favorable product mix  as well as lower costs for material and component parts  in comparison to the year ended december  also  the approximate restructuring charge that was recorded relating to the transition of our uk operations from a manufacturing and distribution facility to a distribution and service center designed to enhance our ability to serve our customers  including the uk ministry of defence  resulting in employee termination costs and certain asset valuation adjustments in  did not reoccur in in our communications systems segment  the cost of products sold decreased  from  in to  in communications systems gross margin for was  or  a decrease of  from s gross margin of  or 
the increase in the gross margin percentage for communications systems resulted from product mix and the recognition of a gain on litigation settlement totaling  in relation to the settlement of an ongoing litigation with a vendor 
in our energy services segment  the cost of sales increased  from  for the year ended december   to  in energy services gross margin for was  or  compared to s gross margin of  or 
gross margin in this particular segment was weaker than expected due to continued intense price competition with component suppliers  relatively low margin jobs that carried over from into  and ongoing integration efforts related to the use acquisition 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  overall  operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased to in from reported the prior year  due to the overall expense increase over a lower revenue base 
in response to this unfavorable change to the percentage of sales  we have consolidated some of our operations to lower the fixed costs basis of our operations  performed an overall cost reduction analysis and tightened our cost controls  along with deferring some of our discretionary spending 
amortization expense associated with intangible assets related to our acquisitions was  for  in selling  general and administrative expenses and in research and development costs  compared with  for  in selling  general  and administrative expenses and in research and development costs 
research and development costs were  in  an increase of  or  over the  reported in  as we increased our investment on product development and design activity 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased  or  to  this increase was comprised of costs related to recently acquired companies  in addition to higher sales and marketing expenses related to development of new territories for the standby power business and generally higher administrative costs 
other income expense 
other income expense totaled  for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  interest expense  net of interest income  increased  from for to  for  mainly as a result of higher average borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in  we recognized a gain of on the early conversion of the  convertible notes held by the sellers of mcdowell  which related to an increase in the interest rate on the notes from to in october miscellaneous income expense amounted to expense of for compared with income of for the income in was primarily due to the recognition of in grant revenue from the satisfaction of all the requirements from a government grant in and the transactions impacted by changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 

table of contents income taxes 
we reflected a tax provision of for the twelve month period ended december  compared with  in the same period of the tax provision included an approximate  non cash charge to record a deferred tax liability for liabilities generated from goodwill and certain intangible assets that cannot be predicted to reverse for book purposes during our loss carryforward periods 
substantially all of this adjustment related to book tax differences that occurred during and were identified during the second quarter of in connection with this adjustment  we reviewed the illustrative list of qualitative considerations provided in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
and other qualitative factors in our determination that this adjustment was not material to the consolidated financial statements

net income loss attributable to ultralife 
net loss attributable to ultralife and loss attributable to ultralife common shareholders per diluted share were  and  respectively  for the year ended december   compared to net income attributable to ultralife and earnings attributable to ultralife common shareholders per diluted share of  and  respectively  for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the reasons described above 
average common shares outstanding used to compute diluted earnings per share decreased from  in to  in  mainly due to the share repurchase program we initiated in the fourth quarter of  offset by stock option and warrant exercises  restricted stock grants  and potentially dilutive shares from unexercised options and convertible notes 

table of contents adjusted ebitda in evaluating our business  we consider and use adjusted ebitda  a non gaap financial measure  as a supplemental measure of our operating performance 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss attributable to ultralife before net interest expense  provision benefit for income taxes  depreciation and amortization  plus minus expenses income that we do not consider reflective of our ongoing operations 
we use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to review and assess our operating performance and to enhance comparability between periods 
we also believe the use of adjusted ebitda facilitates investors use of operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by backing out potential differences caused by variations in such items as capital structures affecting relative interest expense and stock based compensation expense  the book amortization of intangible assets affecting relative amortization expense  the age and book value of facilities and equipment affecting relative depreciation expense and other significant non cash  non operating expenses or income 
we also present adjusted ebitda because we believe it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties as a measure of financial performance 
we reconcile adjusted ebitda to net income loss attributable to ultralife  the most comparable financial measure under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
we use adjusted ebitda in our decision making processes relating to the operation of our business together with us gaap financial measures such as income loss from operations 
we believe that adjusted ebitda permits a comparative assessment of our operating performance  relative to our performance based on our us gaap results  while isolating the effects of depreciation and amortization  which may vary from period to period without any correlation to underlying operating performance  and of non cash stock based compensation  which is a non cash expense that varies widely among companies 
we provide information relating to our adjusted ebitda so that securities analysts  investors and other interested parties have the same data that we employ in assessing our overall operations 
we believe that trends in our adjusted ebitda are a valuable indicator of our operating performance on a consolidated basis and of our ability to produce operating cash flows to fund working capital needs  to service debt obligations and to fund capital expenditures 
the term adjusted ebitda is not defined under us gaap  and is not a measure of operating income  operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with us gaap 
our adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and when assessing our operating performance  adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for net income loss attributable to ultralife or other consolidated statement of operations data prepared in accordance with us gaap 
some of these limitations include  but are not limited to  the following adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  the interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our debt  income taxes or the cash requirements for any tax payments  and all of the costs associated with operating our business  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  while stock based compensation is a component of cost of products sold and operating expenses  the impact on our consolidated financial statements compared to other companies can vary significantly due to such factors as assumed life of the stock based awards and assumed volatility of our common stock  and other companies may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 

table of contents we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our us gaap results and using adjusted ebitda only supplementally 
adjusted ebitda is calculated as follows for the periods presented years ended december  net income loss attributable to ultralife add interest expense  net add less income tax provision benefit add depreciation expense add amortization expense add stock based compensation expense add impairment of goodwill and long lived assets less gain on debt conversion adjusted ebitda liquidity and capital resources cash flows and general business matters as of december   cash and cash equivalents totaled  a decrease of  from the beginning of the year 
during the twelve months ended december   we generated  of cash from operating activities as compared to generating  of cash for the twelve months ended december  the cash from operating activities provided in was mainly attributable to our pre tax loss of  plus an addback of  for non cash expenses of depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation and an impairment charge of goodwill and long lived assets of  approximately  of cash was used for working capital due mainly to increases in accounts receivable  due to timing of orders  and prepaid expenses and a decrease in accounts payable  offset by a decrease in inventories 
for  the cash generated from operating activities of  was mainly attributable to a pre tax loss of  plus an addback of  for non cash expenses of depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation  and partially offset by a gain on litigation settlement of  approximately  of cash was used for working capital due mainly to a decrease in inventories  offset by increases in accounts receivable due to timing of orders and a decrease in accounts payable 
we used  in cash for investing activities during compared with  in cash used for investing activities in in  we spent  to purchase plant  property and equipment  was used to establish a restricted cash fund in connection with our uk operations  and was used in connection with the contingent purchase price payout related to rps power systems  inc rps 
in addition  we received in cash proceeds from dispositions of property  plant and equipment 
in  we spent  to purchase plant  property and equipment  and  was used in connection with the acquisition of amti  as well as contingent purchase price payouts related to redblack and rps 
during  we used  in funds from financing activities compared to the generation of  in funds in the financing activities in included outflows of  for repayments on the revolver portion of our primary credit facilities and  for principal payments on debt and capital lease obligations  and an inflow of cash from stock option exercises of the financing activities in included inflows of  from drawdowns on the revolver portion of our primary credit facility  for proceeds from the issuance of debt  and from stock option and warrant exercises  partially offset by outflows of  for principal payments on term debt under our primary credit facility and capital lease obligations and  for the purchase of treasury shares related to our share repurchase program 
although we booked a full reserve for our deferred tax asset during the fourth quarter of and continued to carry this reserve as of december  and  we continue to have significant us nol s available to us to utilize as an offset to taxable income 
as of december   none of our us nol s have expired 
during  we utilized  of our us nol carryforwards such that over the next five years  there are no scheduled expirations of our us nol s 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
inventory turnover for the year ended december  averaged turns compared to turns for the increase in this metric is mainly due to our conscious efforts to more closely align our inventory purchases with our orders 
our days sales outstanding dsos was an average of days for  a decrease from the average of days  mainly due to our greater overall focus on asset management 

table of contents our order backlog at december  was approximately  the majority of the backlog was related to orders that are expected to ship throughout as of december   we had made commitments to purchase approximately of production machinery and equipment  which we expect to fund through operating cash flows or the use of debt 
potential commitments we had certain exigent  non bid contracts with the us government  which were subject to audit and final price adjustment  which resulted in decreased margins compared with the original terms of the contracts 
as of december   there were no outstanding exigent contracts with the government 
as part of its due diligence  the government has conducted post audits of the completed exigent contracts to ensure that information used in supporting the pricing of exigent contracts did not differ materially from actual results 
in september  the defense contracting audit agency dcaa presented its findings related to the audits of three of the exigent contracts  suggesting a potential pricing adjustment of approximately  related to reductions in the cost of materials that occurred prior to the final negotiation of these contracts 
we have reviewed these audit reports  have submitted our response to these audits and believe  taken as a whole  the proposed audit adjustments can be offset with the consideration of other compensating cost increases that occurred prior to the final negotiation of the contracts 
while we believe that potential exposure exists relating to any final negotiation of these proposed adjustments  we cannot reasonably estimate what  if any  adjustment may result when finalized 
in addition  in june  we received a request from the office of inspector general of the department of defense dod ig seeking certain information and documents relating to our business with the department of defense 
we continue to cooperate with the dcaa audit and dod ig inquiry by making available to government auditors and investigators our personnel and furnishing the requested information and documents 
the dcaa audit and dod ig inquiry have now been consolidated and the us attorney s office is representing the government in connection with these matters 
we recently received a settlement proposal from the us attorney which was based on the non acceptance of various positions submitted by us in discussions and exchanges related to these matters 
we are now reviewing the settlement proposal for purposes of preparing our response 
at this time we have no basis for quantifying any penalties or liabilities we might face on account of the dcaa audit and dod ig inquiry 
the aforementioned dcaa related adjustments could reduce margins and  along with the aforementioned dod ig inquiry  could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
from august through august  we participated in a self insured trust to manage our workers compensation activity for our employees in new york state 
all members of this trust had  by design  joint and several liability during the time they participated in the trust 
in august  we left the self insured trust and have obtained alternative coverage for our workers compensation program through a third party insurer 
in the third quarter of  we confirmed that the trust was in an underfunded position ie the assets of the trust were insufficient to cover the actuarially projected liabilities associated with the members in the trust 
in the third quarter of  we recorded a liability and an associated expense of as an estimate of our potential future cost related to the trust s underfunded status based on our estimated level of participation 
on april   we  along with all other members of the trust  were served by the state of new york workers compensation board compensation board with a summons with notice that was filed in albany county supreme court  wherein the compensation board put all members of the trust on notice that it would be seeking approximately  in previously billed and unpaid assessments and further assessments estimated to be not less than  arising from the accumulated estimated under funding of the trust 
the summons with notice did not contain a complaint or a specified demand 
we timely filed a notice of appearance in response to the summons with notice 
on june   we were served with a verified complaint 
subject to the results of a deficit reconstruction that was pending  the verified complaint estimated that the trust was underfunded by  during the period of december  november  and an additional  for the period december  august  the verified complaint estimated our pro rata share of the liability for the period of december  november  to be the verified complaint did not contain a pro rata share liability estimate for the period of december  august  further  the verified complaint stated that all estimates of the underfunded status of the trust and the pro rata share liability for the period of december  november  were subject to adjustment based on a forensic audit of the trust that was being conducted on behalf of the compensation board by a third party audit firm 
we timely filed our verified answer with affirmative defenses on july  in november  the new york attorney general s office presented the results of the deficit reconstruction of the trust 
as a result of the deficit reconstruction  the state of new york has determined that the trust was underfunded by  instead of  during the period december  to august  our pro rata share of the liability was determined to be the attorney general s office has proposed a settlement by which we may avoid joint and several liability in exchange for settlement payment of under the terms of the settlement agreement  we can satisfy our obligations by either paying i a lump sum of  representing a discount  ii paying the entire amount in twelve monthly installments of commencing the month following execution of the settlement agreement  or iii paying the entire amount in monthly installments over a period of up to five years  with interest of    and for the two  three  four and five year periods  respectively 
we elected the twelve monthly installments option and on may   we received written notice from the attorney general s office that the compensation board had decided to proceed with the settlement  as proposed  and that payments would commence in june as of december   our reserve is to account for the remaining five monthly installments of the settlement amount 

table of contents in connection with our acquisition of stationary power on november   the purchase agreement specified an adjustment mechanism based upon stationary power s closing date net worth balance relative to a previously agreed amount of the final net value of the net worth  under the stock purchase agreement  was  resulting in a revised initial purchase price of  in addition  there is a contingent payout of up to  shares of our common stock to be earned upon the achievement of certain post acquisition annual sales milestones through the measurement period ended december  through the year ended december   we have issued no shares of our common stock relating to this contingent consideration 
in connection with our acquisition of rps on november   on the achievement of certain post acquisition sales milestones  we will pay the previous owners of rps  in cash  of sales up to the sales in the operating plan  and of sales that exceed the sales in the operating plan  for the remainder of the calendar year and for calendar years  and the additional contingent cash consideration is payable in annual installments  and excludes sales made to stationary power  which historically have comprised substantially all of rps s sales

in connection with our acquisition of use on november   there was a contingent payout of up to  shares of our unregistered common stock to be earned upon the achievement of certain post acquisition revenue milestones 
on april   we entered into amendment no 
to the use asset purchase agreement 
under the terms of amendment no 
 we agreed to issue an aggregate of  shares of our unregistered common stock  valued at approximately  in full satisfaction of our outstanding obligations under the use asset purchase agreement 
we elected to enter into amendment no 
because our consolidation plan and the reorganization of our reporting units involved reorganizing the operations of the business purchased in the use asset purchase agreement 
the post acquisition revenue milestones in the use asset purchase agreement did not support our current consolidation and reorganization plans and it was determined that it would be in our best interests to satisfy our obligations under the use asset purchase agreement 
amendment no 
did not change our original assessment that the contingent payout of shares of common stock was related to the acquisition of the assets of use 
accordingly  we reflected the payment as additional purchase price 
our evaluation in the fourth quarter of  with new information available at that time and based on the overall operations of the standby power business  resulted in the impairment charges previously discussed and included the contingent consideration related to amendment no

table of contents equity transactions in october  the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to  to be implemented over the course of a six month period 
repurchases were made from time to time at management s discretion  either in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
the repurchases were made in compliance with securities and exchange commission guidelines and were subject to market conditions  applicable legal requirements  and other factors 
we have no obligation under the program to repurchase shares and the program could have been suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice 
we funded the purchase price for shares acquired primarily with current cash on hand and cash generated from operations  in addition to borrowing from our credit facility  as necessary 
we spent  to repurchase  shares of common stock  at an average price of approximately per share  under this share repurchase program 
during the first quarter of  we repurchased  shares of common stock at an average price of approximately per share  under this share repurchase program  all other share repurchases were made in the fourth quarter of in april  this share repurchase program expired 
in some of our recent acquisitions  we utilized securities as consideration in these transactions in part to reduce the need to draw on the liquidity provided by our cash and cash equivalents and revolving credit facility 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
other matters we continually explore various sources of liquidity to ensure financing flexibility  including leasing alternatives  issuing new or refinancing existing debt  and raising equity through private or public offerings 
although we stay abreast of such financing alternatives  we believe we have the ability during the next months to finance our operations primarily through internally generated funds or through the use of additional financing that currently is available to us 
in the event that we are unable to finance our operations with the internally generated funds or through the use of additional financing that currently is available to us  we may need to seek additional credit or access capital markets for additional funds 
we can provide no assurance  given the current state of credit markets  that we would be successful in this regard  especially in light of our recent operating performance 
if we are unable to achieve our plans or unforeseen events occur  we may need to implement alternative plans in addition to plans that we have already initiated 
while we believe we can complete our original plans or alternative plans  if necessary  there can be no assurance that such alternatives would be available on acceptable terms and conditions or that we would be successful in our implementation of such plans 
as described in part i  item  legal proceedings of this report  we are involved in certain environmental matters with respect to our facility in newark  new york 
although we have reserved for expenses related to this potential exposure  there can be no assurance that such reserve will be adequate 
the ultimate resolution of this matter may have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations in the period in which it is resolved 
with respect to our battery products  we typically offer warranties against any defects due to product malfunction or workmanship for a period up to one year from the date of purchase 
with respect to our communications accessory products  we typically offer a four year warranty 
we also offer a year warranty on our volt batteries that are used in ionization type smoke detector applications 
we provide for a reserve for these potential warranty expenses  which is based on an analysis of historical warranty issues 
there is no assurance that future warranty claims will be consistent with past history  and in the event we experience a significant increase in warranty claims  there is no assurance that our reserves would be sufficient 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents contractual obligations payments due by period less than more than total year years years years contractual obligations long term debt obligations expected interest payments capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total expected interest payments are calculated assuming a annual rate on the outstanding revolver balance  plus associated fees related to our credit facility  and the applicable annual interest rates ranging from to for various notes payable for equipment and vehicles 
purchase obligations consist of commitments for property  plant and equipment  open purchase orders for materials and supplies  and other general commitments for various service contracts 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the above discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
the estimates and assumptions that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments are described below 
revenue recognition product sales in general  revenues from the sale of products are recognized when products are shipped 
when products are shipped with terms that require transfer of title upon delivery at a customer s location  revenues are recognized on date of delivery 
a provision is made at the time the revenue is recognized for warranty costs expected to be incurred 
customers  including distributors  do not have a general right of return on products shipped 
service contracts revenue from the sale of installation services is recognized upon customer acceptance  generally the date of installation 
revenue from fixed price engineering contracts is recognized on a proportional method  measured by the percentage of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs to complete the contract 
revenue from time and material engineering contracts is recognized as work progresses through monthly billings of time and materials as they are applied to the work pursuant to the terms in the respective contract 
revenue from customer maintenance agreements is recognized using the straight line method over the term of the related agreements  which range from six months to three years 
technology contracts we recognize revenue using the proportional method  measured by the percentage of actual costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the contract 
elements of cost include direct material  labor and overhead 
if a loss on a contract is estimated  the full amount of the loss is recognized immediately 
we allocate costs to all technology contracts based upon actual costs incurred including an allocation of certain research and development costs incurred 
deferred revenue for each source of revenues  we defer recognition if i evidence of an agreement does not exist  ii delivery or service has not occurred  iii the selling price is not fixed or determinable  or iv collectability is not reasonably assured 

table of contents valuation of inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
our inventory includes raw materials  work in process and finished goods 
we record provisions for excess  obsolete or slow moving inventory based on changes in customer demand  technology developments or other economic factors 
the factors that contribute to inventory valuation risks are our purchasing practices  material and product obsolescence  accuracy of sales and production forecasts  introduction of new products  product lifecycles  product support and foreign regulations governing hazardous materials see item a risk factors for further information on foreign regulations 
we manage our exposure to inventory valuation risks by maintaining safety stocks  minimum purchase lots  managing product end of life issues brought on by aging components or new product introductions  and by utilizing certain inventory minimization strategies such as vendor managed inventories 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to valuation of inventories is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to changes from period to period due to the requirement for management to make estimates relative to each of the underlying factors ranging from purchasing  to sales  to production  to after sale support 
if actual demand  market conditions or product lifecycles are adversely different from those estimated by management  inventory adjustments to lower market values would result in a reduction to the carrying value of inventory  an increase in inventory write offs and a decrease to gross margins 
warranties we maintain provisions related to normal warranty claims by customers 
we evaluate these reserves quarterly based on actual experience with warranty claims to date and our assessment of additional claims in the future 
there is no assurance that future warranty claims will be consistent with past history  and in the event we experience a significant increase in warranty claims  there is no assurance that our reserves would be sufficient 
impairment of long lived assets we regularly assess all of our long lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
this is accomplished by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows of the assets with the respective carrying amount as of the date of assessment 
should aggregate future cash flows be less than the carrying value  a write down would be required  measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset 
fair value is estimated either through the assistance of an independent valuation or as the present value of expected discounted future cash flows 
the discount rate used by us in our evaluation approximates our weighted average cost of capital 
if the expected undiscounted future cash flows exceed the respective carrying amount as of the date of assessment  no impairment is recognized 
environmental issues environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized  as appropriate  in accordance with fasb s guidance on environmental remediation liabilities 
remediation costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued when it is probable that these costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the revised fasb guidance for business combinations  the purchase price paid to effect an acquisition is allocated to the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities at fair value 
in accordance with fasb s guidance for the accounting of goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  but instead measure these assets for impairment at least annually  or when events indicate that impairment exists 
we amortize intangible assets that have definite lives so that the economic benefits of the intangible assets are being utilized over their weighted average estimated useful life 
the impairment test for goodwill consists of a comparison of the fair value of the goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit to which it is assigned 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step of the goodwill impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the impairment test for intangible assets with indefinite lives consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible assets with their carrying amounts 
if the intangible assets exceeds their fair value  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we determine the fair value of the reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing based on a discounted cash flow model 
we determine the fair value of our intangibles assets with indefinite lives trademarks through the relief from a royalty income valuation approach 

table of contents we conduct our annual impairment analysis for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in october of each fiscal year 
for  we have identified six goodwill reporting units for testing  and based on our results of the step testing  we needed to conduct step testing for the standby power business reporting unit 
based on our results of the step testing  we concluded that we have a full impairment of goodwill in connection with the standby power business reporting unit 
for  we have identified four trademarks for testing  and based on our results of the testing  we have a full impairment of the trademark in connection with the standby power business 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information of impairment charges 
there were no other impairments of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for however  due to the narrow margin of passing the step goodwill impairment testing for in the redblack reporting unit  there is potential for a partial or full impairment of the goodwill value in if the projected operational results are not achieved 
one of the key assumptions for achieving the projected operational results includes significant revenue growth 
as of december   the redblack reporting unit had a goodwill carrying value of  stock based compensation we follow the provisions of fasb s guidance on share based payments  which requires that compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
the cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity award 
we calculate expected volatility for stock options by taking an average of historical volatility over the past five years and a computation of implied volatility 
a blended volatility factor was deemed to be more appropriate as we believe that implied volatility  a forward looking measure  provides a more market driven valuation related to investors expectations of the volatility of our business  and provides a balance against focusing only on a historical measure 
the computation of expected term was determined based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards and vesting schedules 
the interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the us treasury yield in effect at the time of grant 
income taxes we apply fasb s guidance in accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that may be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
in  and  we continued to report a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets that cannot be offset by reversing temporary differences in the us  the us and china arising from the conclusion that we would not be able to utilize our us  us and china nol s that had accumulated over time 
the recognition of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset resulted from our evaluation of all available evidence  both positive and negative 
the assessment of the realizability of the nol s was based on a number of factors including  our history of net operating losses  the volatility of our earnings  our historical operating volatility  our historical ability to accurately forecast earnings for future periods and the continued uncertainty of the general business climate as of the end of we concluded that these factors represent sufficient negative evidence and have concluded that we should record a full valuation allowance under fasb s guidance on the accounting for income taxes 
we continually assess the carrying value of this asset based on relevant accounting standards

 business combinations topic disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force eitf 
asu no 
amends accounting guidance concerning disclosure of supplemental pro forma information for business combinations 
if an entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred in the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the accounting guidance also requires additional disclosures to describe the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments 
asu no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  and will apply prospectively to business combinations completed on or after that date 
we do not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a significant impact on our financial statements

asu no 
modifies step of the goodwill impairment test so that for those reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not based on an assessment of qualitative indicators that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
asu no

asu no 
is limited to research or development arrangements and requires that this asu be met for an entity to apply the milestone method record the milestone payment in its entirety in the period received of recognizing revenue 
however  the fasb clarified that  even if the requirements in this asu are met  entities would not be precluded from making an accounting policy election to apply another appropriate policy that results in the deferral of some portion of the arrangement consideration 
the guidance in this asu will apply to milestones in both single deliverable and multiple deliverable arrangements involving research or development transactions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in thousands we are exposed to various market risks in the normal course of business  primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency risk 
our primary interest rate risk is derived from our outstanding variable rate debt obligation 
in connection with our credit facility with rbs  at december   the interest rate is variable based on libor plus 
the impact of a one percentage point change in the interest rate associated with the rbs credit facility would not have a material impact on our interest expense 
we are subject to foreign currency risk  due to fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar 
in the year ended december   approximately of our sales were denominated in us dollars 
the remainder of our sales was denominated in uk pounds sterling  euros  australian dollars  canadian dollars  indian rupee and chinese yuan renminbi 
a change in the value of the pound sterling  the euro  australian dollar  canadian dollar  the rupee or the yuan renminbi to the us dollar would have impacted our revenues in that period by approximately 
we monitor the relationship between the us dollar and other currencies on a continuous basis and adjust sales prices for products and services sold in these foreign currencies as appropriate to safeguard against the fluctuations in the currency relative to the us dollar 
we maintain manufacturing operations in north america  europe and asia  and export products internationally 
we purchase materials and sell our products in foreign currencies  and therefore currency fluctuations may impact our pricing of products sold and materials purchased 
in addition  our foreign subsidiaries maintain their books in local currency  which is translated into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements
