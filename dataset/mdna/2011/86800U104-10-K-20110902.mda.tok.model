item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly under the heading risk factors 
overview we are a global leader in server technology and green computing innovation 
we develop and provide high performance server solutions based on an innovative  modular and open standard architecture 
our solutions include a range of complete rackmount  workstation  storage  graphic processing unit and blade server systems  as well as subsystems and accessories which can be used by distributors  oems and end customers to assemble server systems 
to date  we have generated the majority of our net sales from subsystems 
in recent years our growth in net sales has been driven by the growth in the market for application optimized server systems 
for fiscal years  and  net sales of optimized servers were million  million and million  respectively  and net sales of subsystems and accessories were million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in our net sales in fiscal year compared with fiscal year was primarily attributable to the server refresh cycle and increased sales across our product lines 
the growth on a percentage basis was primarily in our superblade  gpu and storage solutions 
we commenced operations in and have been profitable every year since inception 
for fiscal years  and  our net sales were million  million and million  respectively  and our net income was million  million and million  respectively 
our increase in profitability in fiscal year was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross profit resulting from our increased net sales and to a lesser extent to the lower effective tax rate resulting from the reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit in fiscal year we sell our server systems and subsystems and accessories primarily through distributors and to a lesser extent to oems as well as through our direct sales force 
for fiscal years  and  we derived  and  respectively  of our net sales from products sold to distributors  and we derived  and  respectively  from sales to oems and to end customers 
none of our customers accounted for or more of our net sales in fiscal years  or for fiscal years  and  we derived  and  respectively  of our net sales from customers in the united states 
for fiscal years   and  we derived  and  respectively  of our net sales from customers outside the united states 
we perform the majority of our research and development efforts in house 
for fiscal years  and  research and development expenses represented  and of our net sales  respectively 
we use several suppliers and contract manufacturers to design and manufacture components in accordance with our specifications  with most final assembly and testing performed at our manufacturing facility in san jose  california 
during fiscal year  we continued to invest in expanding our operations both in san jose  california and our subsidiaries in the netherlands and taiwan in order to support our growth 
we have increased manufacturing and service operations in the netherlands and taiwan to support our european and asian customers and we plan to continue expanding our overseas manufacturing capacity through fiscal year one of our key suppliers is ablecom  a related party  which supplies us with contract design and manufacturing support 
for fiscal years  and  our purchases from ablecom represented  and of our cost of sales  respectively 
the decrease in percentage of cost of sales in fiscal year and was primarily related to server systems sales composing a higher percentage of our net sales and a change in product mix which resulted in a higher percentage of server subsystems and accessories being purchased from other suppliers 
ablecom s sales to us constitute a substantial majority of ablecom s net sales 
we continue to 
table of contents maintain our manufacturing relationship with ablecom in asia in an effort to reduce our product costs and do not have any current plans to reduce our reliance on ablecom product purchases 
in addition to providing a larger volume of contract manufacturing services for us  ablecom continues to warehouse for us a number of components and subassemblies manufactured by multiple suppliers prior to shipment to our facilities in the us and europe 
we typically negotiate the price of products that we purchase from ablecom on a quarterly basis  however  either party may re negotiate the price of products with each order 
as a result of our relationship with ablecom  it is possible that ablecom may in the future sell products to us at a price higher or lower than we could obtain from an unrelated third party supplier 
this may result in our future reporting of gross profit as a percentage of net sales that is less than or in excess of what we might have obtained absent our relationship with ablecom 
in order to continue to increase our net sales and profits  we believe that we must continue to develop flexible and customizable server solutions and be among the first to market with new features and products 
we measure our financial success based on various indicators  including growth in net sales  gross profit as a percentage of net sales  operating income as a percentage of net sales  levels of inventory  and days sales outstanding  or dsos 
in connection with these efforts  we monitor daily and weekly sales and shipment reports 
among the key non financial indicators of our success is our ability to rapidly introduce new products and deliver the latest application optimized server solutions 
in this regard  we work closely with microprocessor and other component vendors to take advantage of new technologies as they are introduced 
historically  our ability to introduce new products rapidly has allowed us to benefit from the introduction of new microprocessors and as a result we monitor the introduction cycles of intel  amd and nvidia carefully 
this also impacts our research and development expenditures 
for example  our results for the quarter ended march  were in part adversely impacted by customer order delays in anticipation of the introduction of the nehalem line of microprocessors and research and development expenditures necessary for us to prepare for the introduction 
other financial highlights the following is a summary of other financial highlights of fiscal year net cash generated used in operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal year  and  respectively 
our cash and cash equivalents  together with our investments  were million at the end of fiscal year  compare with million at the end of fiscal year the decrease in our cash and cash equivalents  together with our investments at the end of fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in our inventory balance to support our growth and the investments in property for our expansion overseas 
days sales outstanding in accounts receivable dso at the end of fiscal year was days  consistent with the end of fiscal year our inventory balance was million at the end of fiscal year  compared with million at the end of fiscal year days sales of inventory dsi at the end of fiscal year was days  compared with days at the end of fiscal year the increase in our inventory balance at the end of fiscal year was in part due to an increase in demand for our products resulting from a recovering economy  in part to support our growth and in part due to our increasing manufacturing activities in the netherlands and taiwan 
our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers were million at the end of fiscal year and million at the end of fiscal year in august  we purchased land in taiwan  consisting of approximately acres for a total purchase price of million 
in march  we drew an additional million from our revolving line of credit and paid million as a deposit to purchase land in taiwan that is adjacent to the land that was purchased in august title to this land is expected to transfer in the first half of fiscal year we are developing the land through fiscal year for manufacturing and service operations 

table of contents fiscal year our fiscal year ends on june references to fiscal year  for example  refer to the fiscal year ended june  revenues and expenses net sales 
net sales consist of sales of our server solutions  including server systems  subsystems and accessories 
the main factors which impact our net sales are unit volumes shipped and average selling prices 
the prices for server systems range widely depending upon the configuration  and the prices for our subsystems and accessories vary based on the type 
as with most electronics based products  average selling prices typically are highest at the time of introduction of new products which utilize the latest technology and tend to decrease over time as such products mature in the market and are replaced by next generation products 
cost of sales 
cost of sales primarily consists of the costs to manufacture our products  including the costs of materials  contract manufacturing  shipping  personnel and related expenses  equipment and facility expenses  warranty costs and inventory excess and obsolete provisions 
the primary factors that impact our cost of sales are the mix of products sold and cost of materials  which include raw material costs  shipping costs and salary and benefits related to production 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales may increase over time if decreases in average selling prices are not offset by corresponding decreases in our costs 
our cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  is generally lower on server systems than on subsystems and accessories 
because we do not have long term fixed supply agreements  our cost of sales is subject to change based on market conditions 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist of the personnel and related expenses of our research and development teams  and materials and supplies  consulting services  third party testing services and equipment and facility expenses related to our research and development activities 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we occasionally receive non recurring engineering  or nre funding from certain suppliers and customers 
under these programs  we are reimbursed for certain research and development costs that we incur as part of the joint development of our products and those of our suppliers and customers 
these amounts offset a portion of the related research and development expenses and have the effect of reducing our reported research and development expenses 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions for our sales and marketing personnel  costs for tradeshows  independent sales representative fees and marketing programs 
from time to time  we receive cooperative marketing funding from certain suppliers 
under these programs  we are reimbursed for certain marketing costs that we incur as part of the joint promotion of our products and those of our suppliers 
these amounts offset a portion of the related expenses and have the effect of reducing our reported sales and marketing expenses 
similarly  we from time to time offer our distributors cooperative marketing funding which has the effect of increasing our expenses 
the timing  magnitude and estimated usage of our programs and those of our suppliers can result in significant variations in reported sales and marketing expenses from period to period 
spending on cooperative marketing  either by us or our suppliers  typically increases in connection with significant product releases by us or our suppliers 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of general corporate costs  including personnel expenses  financial reporting  corporate governance and compliance and outside legal  audit and tax fees 
provision for litigation loss 
loss from litigation relates to an action filed in france by digitechnic  sa  a former customer 
the company entered into a settlement agreement with digitechnic  pursuant to which the company made a payment of million in december interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net represents the net of our interest income on investments or interest expense on the building loans or letters of credit for our owned facilities offset by interest earned on our cash balances 

table of contents income tax provision 
our income tax provision is based on our taxable income generated in the jurisdictions in which we operate  currently primarily the united states and the netherlands and to a lesser extent  taiwan 
our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to research and development tax credits and the domestic production activities deduction which were partially offset by the impact of state taxes and stock option expenses 
a reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate is set forth in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns  cooperative marketing accruals  investment valuations  inventory valuations  income taxes  warranty obligations and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making the judgments we make about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
because these estimates can vary depending on the situation  actual results may differ from the estimates 
we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies as they require our more significant judgments in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from sales of products  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment has occurred and title has transferred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  and all significant obligations have been met 
generally this occurs at the time of shipment when risk of loss and title has passed to the customer 
our standard arrangement with our customers includes a signed purchase order or contract  to days payment terms  ex works terms  except for a few customers who have free on board destination terms or customer acceptance provisions  and revenue is recognized when the products arrive or are accepted at the destination 
we generally do not provide for non warranty rights of return except for products which have out of box failure  where customers could return these products for credit within days of receiving the items 
certain distributors and oems are also permitted to return products in unopened boxes  limited to purchases over a specified period of time  generally within to days of the purchase  or to products in the distributor s or oem s inventory at certain times such as the termination of the agreement or product obsolescence 
in addition  we have a sale arrangement with an oem that has limited product return rights 
to estimate reserves for future sales returns  we regularly review our history of actual returns for each major product line 
we also communicate regularly with our distributors to gather information about end customer satisfaction  and to determine the volume of inventory in the channel 
reserves for future returns are adjusted as necessary  based on returns experience  returns expectations and communication with our distributors 
in addition  certain customers have acceptance provisions and revenue is deferred until the customers provide the necessary acceptance 
at june  and  we had deferred revenue of million and million and related deferred product costs of million and million  respectively  related to shipments to customers pending acceptances 
probability of collection is assessed on a customer by customer basis 
customers are subjected to a credit review process that evaluates the customers financial position and ability to pay 
if it is determined from the outset of an arrangement that collection is not probable based upon the review process  the customers are required to pay cash in advance of shipment 
we also make estimates of the uncollectibility of accounts receivables  analyzing accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms to evaluate the adequacy of the 
table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate aged items in the accounts receivable aging report and provide an allowance in an amount we deem adequate for doubtful accounts 
if management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates  material differences in the amount of our reported operating expenses could result 
we provide for price protection to certain distributors 
we assess the market competition and product technology obsolescence  and make price adjustments based on our judgment 
upon each announcement of price reductions  the accrual for price protection is calculated based on our distributors inventory on hand 
such reserves are recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time we reduce the product prices 
we have an immaterial amount of service revenue relating to non warranty repairs  which is recognized upon shipment of the repaired units to customers 
service revenue has been less than of net sales for all periods presented and is not separately disclosed 
cooperative marketing accruals 
we have arrangements with resellers of our products to reimburse the resellers for cooperative marketing costs meeting specified criteria 
we accrue the cooperative marketing costs based on these arrangements and our estimate for resellers claims for marketing activities 
we record marketing costs meeting such specified criteria within sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations 
for those marketing costs that do not meet the specified criteria  the amounts are recorded as a reduction to sales in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations 
impairment of short term and long term investments 
impairment of short term and long term investments relates to the unrealized loss on the carrying value of our investments in auction rate securities  such securities were rated aaa at the date of purchase 
the liquidity and fair value of these securities has been negatively impacted by the uncertainty in the credit markets and exposure of these securities to the financial condition of bond insurance companies 
we have received all interest payments due on these instruments on a timely basis 
each of these securities has been subject to auction processes for which there has been insufficient bidders on the scheduled rollover dates and the auctions have subsequently failed 
when these securities lost the short term liquidity previously provided by the auction processes  we reclassified these securities as long term investments 
for the securities with the stated maturity less than a year  the securities were classified as short term available for sale investments 
we have used a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of these investments as of june  and the material factors used in preparing the discounted cash flow model are the discount rate utilized to present value the cash flows  the time period until redemption and the estimated rate of return 
management derives the estimates by obtaining input from market data on the applicable discount rate  estimated time to maturity and estimated rate of return 
the changes in fair value have been primarily due to changes in the estimated rate of return and a change in the estimated period to liquidity 
the fair value of our investment portfolio may change between to by increasing or decreasing the rate of return used by or by increasing or decreasing the term used by year 
changes in these estimates or in the market conditions for these investments are likely in the future based upon the then current market conditions for these investments and may affect the fair value of these investments 
as of june  and we have recorded an accumulated unrealized loss of million  net of deferred income taxes  on the securities 
we deem this loss to be temporary as we determined that we will not likely be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery and we have the intent and ability to hold our investments until recovery of cost 
product warranties 
we offer product warranties ranging from to months against any defective product 
we accrue for estimated returns of defective products at the time revenue is recognized  based on historical warranty experience and recent trends 
we monitor warranty obligations and may make revisions to our warranty reserve if actual costs of product repair and replacement are significantly higher or lower than estimated 
accruals for anticipated future warranty costs are charged to cost of sales and included in accrued liabilities 
the liability for product warranties was million as of june   compared with million as of june  the provision for warranty reserve was million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
our estimates and assumptions used have been historically close to actual 
the change in estimated liability for pre existing warranties was million  million and 
table of contents million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
as we experienced an increase in net sales in fiscal year  the provision for warranty reserve increased million compared to fiscal year as we experienced an increase in net sales in fiscal year  the provision for warranty reserve increased million compared to fiscal year if in future periods  we experience or anticipate an increase or decrease in warranty claims as a result of new product introductions or change in unit volumes compared with our historical experience  or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater or lesser than expected  we intend to adjust our estimates appropriately 
inventory valuation 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
we evaluate inventory on a quarterly basis for lower of cost or market and excess and obsolescence and  as necessary  write down the valuation of units to lower of cost or market or for excess and obsolescence based upon the number of units that are unlikely to be sold based upon estimated demand for the following twelve months 
this evaluation takes into account matters including expected demand  anticipated sales price  product obsolescence and other factors 
if actual future demand for our products is less than currently forecasted  additional inventory adjustments may be required 
once a reserve is established  it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or scrapped 
if a unit that has been written down is subsequently sold  the cost associated with the revenue from this unit is reduced to the extent of the write down  resulting in an increase in gross profit 
we monitor the extent to which previously written down inventory is sold at amounts greater or less than carrying value  and based on this analysis  adjust our estimate for determining future write downs 
if in future periods  we experience or anticipate a change in recovery rate compared with our historical experience  our gross margin would be affected 
our provision for inventory was million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach 
deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for income tax reporting purposes  net operating loss carry forwards and other tax credits measured by applying currently enacted tax laws 
valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we recognize the tax liability for uncertain income tax positions on the income tax return based on the two step process 
the first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that each income tax position would be sustained upon audit 
the second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority 
estimating these amounts requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on the consideration of several factors  including changes in facts or circumstances  changes in applicable tax law  settlement of issues under audit and new exposures 
if we later determine that our exposure is lower or that the liability is not sufficient to cover our revised expectations  we adjust the liability and effect a related change in our tax provision during the period in which we make such determination 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the impact on our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation 
effective july   stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
prior to july   we have recorded compensation expense for stock options with exercise prices less than the fair value of the underlying common stock at the option grant date 
amortization of deferred stock compensation  resulting from such stock options granted to employees and directors  when the exercise price of our stock options was less than the deemed market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant  for the years ended june   and  was  million and million  respectively 
since july   the company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments  including stock options  based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award  known as the requisite service period usually the vesting period 

table of contents compensation expense for options granted to employees after july   was million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
as of june   the total unrecognized compensation cost  adjusted for estimated forfeitures  related to unvested stock options granted since july  to employees and non employee directors  was million  which is expected to be recognized as an expense over a weighted average period of approximately years 
see note of notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we estimated the fair value of stock options granted using a black scholes option pricing model and a single option award approach 
this model requires us to make estimates and assumptions with respect to the expected term of the option  the expected volatility of the price of our common stock and the expected forfeiture rate 
the fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
the expected term represents the period that our stock based awards are expected to be outstanding and was determined based on an analysis of the relevant peer companies post vest termination rates and exercise behavior 
the expected volatility is based on a combination of the implied and historical volatility of our relevant peer group for the stock options granted prior to september  for stock options granted after september   expected volatility is based solely on our historical volatility 
in addition  forfeitures of share based awards are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
variable interest entities 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods therein and thereafter 
the new guidance requires revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities  ongoing assessments of control over such entities  and additional disclosures for variable interests 
we adopted this standard and have analyzed our relationship with ablecom and its subsidiaries collectively ablecom 
we have concluded that ablecom is a variable interest entity in accordance with applicable accounting standards and guidance  however  we are not the primary beneficiary of ablecom and therefore  we do not consolidate ablecom 
in performing our analysis  we considered our explicit arrangements with ablecom including the supplier and distributor arrangements 
also  as a result of the substantial related party relationship between the two companies  we considered whether any implicit arrangements exist that would cause us to protect those related parties interests in ablecom from suffering losses 
we determined that no implicit arrangements exist with ablecom or its shareholders 
such an arrangement would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duty that we have towards our stockholders who do not own shares in ablecom 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth our financial results  as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated years ended june  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative provision for litigation loss total operating expenses income from operations interest and other income  net interest expense income before income tax provision income tax provision net income comparison of fiscal years ended june  and net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to million from million  for fiscal year and  respectively 
this increase was due primarily to an increase in unit volumes of server systems and subsystems and accessories and an increase in average selling prices of server systems 
for fiscal year  the number of units sold increased to million compared to million for fiscal year for fiscal year  the number of server system units sold increased to  compared to  for fiscal year the average selling price of server system units increased to  in fiscal year compared to  in fiscal year the average selling prices of our server systems increased principally due to an increase in our sales of complete integrated  high end server solutions to oem and end customers and higher average selling prices of  and series configuration of servers which incorporated additional features such as higher density  memory and hard disk drive capacity and higher average selling prices of superblades offset in part by declines in average selling prices of more mature products

the increase in absolute dollars of cost of sales was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales  an increase of million in freight in charges  an increase of million in provision for warranty reserve and an increase of million in provision for inventory reserve 
the lower cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in sales of server systems and an increase in sales to oem and end customers 
in fiscal year  we recorded a million expense  or of net sales  related to the provision for warranty reserve as compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal year the increase in the provision for warranty reserve was primarily due to higher net sales in fiscal year if in future periods we experience or anticipate an increase or decrease in warranty claims as a result of new product introductions or change in unit volumes compared with our historical experience  or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater or lesser than expected  our gross margin would be affected 
in fiscal year  we recorded a million expense  or of net sales  related to the inventory provision as compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal year the increase in the inventory provision was primarily for older products as a result of product transitions 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased by million  or  to million from million  for fiscal year and  respectively 
research and development expenses were and of net sales for fiscal year and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of million in compensation and benefits resulting from growth in research and development personnel  including higher stock based compensation expense related to expanded product development initiatives in the us and in taiwan  an increase of million in development costs associated with new products offset in part by an increase of million in non recurring engineering funding from certain suppliers and customers

interest and other expense  net 
interest and other expense changed by million  to million of expense from million of expense  for fiscal year and  respectively  which included million and million of interest expense for fiscal year and  respectively 
the net change was primarily due to higher interest expense as our average debt outstanding for fiscal year was million versus million in fiscal year interest rates were not significantly different in fiscal year compared to we expect that our interest expenses will increase in the future as we plan to obtain additional financing from banks to fund the construction of the taiwan facilities and the expansion of our headquarters office in san jose 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes increased by million  or  to million from million  for the fiscal year and  respectively 
the effective tax rate was and for fiscal year and  respectively

table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing the risk 
some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in money market funds and certificates of deposit 
since our results of operations are not dependent on investments  the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio  and we believe that a change in interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations
