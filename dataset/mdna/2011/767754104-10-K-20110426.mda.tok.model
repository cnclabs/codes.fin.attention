fiscal included significant non cash charges related to goodwill impairment  store impairment and an additional tax valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that accounted for billion or per diluted share 
excluding these significant non cash charges  fiscal s net loss would have been million or per diluted share 
our operating results are described in detail in the results of operations section of this item some of the key factors that impacted our results in fiscal  and are summarized as follows write off of goodwill during fiscal  we impaired all of our existing goodwill  which resulted in a non cash charge of billion

asc  income taxes requires a company to evaluate its deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets is required 
a cumulative loss in recent years is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable 
based on the negative evidence  asc precludes relying on projections of future taxable income to support the recognition of deferred tax assets 
net loss for fiscal included income tax expense of million 
the income tax expense was primarily due to an accrual for state and local taxes net of federal tax recoveries and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits 
net loss for fiscal included income tax expense of million related to a non cash write down of our remaining net federal and state deferred tax assets through an adjustment to our valuation allowance 
this change was primarily due to a decline in actual results from our previous forecast as a result of the impact of current economic conditions on fiscal results 
store closing and impairment charges we recorded store closing and impairment charges of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in store closing and impairment charges in fiscal lifo charges we record the value of our inventory on the last in  first out lifo method 
we recorded non cash lifo charges of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the higher lifo charge in fiscal was due to higher inflation on front end products in that year 

table of contents debt refinancing in fiscal years  and  we took several steps to extend the terms of our debt and obtain more flexibility 
in fiscal  we repaid all borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility and cancelled all commitments thereunder and replaced the facility with a new million revolving credit facility 
additionally  in fiscal we issued million of senior secured notes due august  the proceeds of which were used to repay and retire all borrowings and accrued interest under our million tranche term loan 
we recorded a loss on debt modification related to the tranche term loan transaction in fiscal the prepayment of the tranche term loan occurred prior to the second anniversary of the borrowing and therefore a penalty of the principal amount outstanding was paid totaling million which is included in the loss on debt modifications 
the loss on debt modifications and retirements also includes the write off of debt issue costs of million and net unamortized original issuance discount of million 
in fiscal  we refinanced our first and second lien securitization facilities  refinanced and extended the maturity of our revolving credit facility  and repaid all the borrowings outstanding under our tranche term loan 
these refinancings were funded via the issuance of our million tranche term loan under our senior secured credit facility  million of senior secured notes due june and million of senior secured notes due october we incurred fees of million to consummate the fiscal refinancings and recorded a loss on debt modification of million

b on march   we launched a stock option exchange offer providing eligible associates the opportunity to surrender certain stock options for a lesser number of new stock options with a strike price that was determined based on the closing market price 
table of contents on april   the day the exchange offer concluded 
the number of new options was determined by applying exchange ratios that resulted in providing new stock options with an aggregate fair value that approximates the aggregate fair value of the options they replaced

this decline consisted of pharmacy same store sales decrease and a decrease in front end same store sales 
additionally  revenues decreased compared to the prior year due to revenue deferrals related to our wellness loyalty program

relocation stores are not included in same store sales until one year has lapsed 
pharmacy same store sales decreased 
same store prescriptions decreased 
the decline in same store prescriptions was impacted by a slower start and overall softer cough  cold and flu season  coupled with an increase in day prescriptions compared to last year 
same store sales were negatively impacted by lower reimbursement rates  increased generic penetration and the prescription decline 
these trends improved during our fourth quarter as the cough  cold and flu season intensified contributing to same store pharmacy sales increased

the impact on sales of the increase in our prescription count was partially offset by an increase in generic sales and reductions in pharmacy reimbursement rates 
front end same store sales decreased from the prior year  due to weakness in the overall economic environment and its impact on consumer shopping behavior and the impact of some of our initiatives  including our efforts to reduce costs  to reduce inventory  and to make changes to operating procedures for low volume stores

there was a negative impact from the reductions in medicare reimbursements resulting from the awp rollback which was fully cycled in september the pharmacy margin pressure slowed as we continued to cycle the more significant maximum allowable costs mac of new generics which occurred last year 
front end gross margin was lower due primarily to an increase in deferred revenue related to our wellness customer loyalty program and related discounts 
partially offsetting the lower gross margin discussed above was a reduction in lifo and inventory cost capitalization charges 

table of contents gross margin rate was for fiscal compared to in fiscal the decline in gross margin rate for fiscal was driven primarily by pharmacy margin decline due to reductions in reimbursement rates including reductions in medicaid reimbursements resulting from the awp rollback  fewer new generics and fewer price reductions on existing generics 
front end gross margin was lower  as improvements in shrink and distribution costs and lower inventory capitalization costs were more than offset by a higher mix of promotional sales and revenue deferrals related to our wellness customer loyalty program 
partially offsetting the decline in front end and pharmacy margins was a reduction in lifo expense 
we use the last in  first out lifo method of inventory valuation 
the lifo charge was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the higher lifo charge in fiscal was due to higher inflation on front end products in that year 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for fiscal was as a percentage of revenue  compared to in fiscal the decrease in sg a as a percentage of revenues is mostly due to a decrease in salaries and benefit costs due to better labor control and reductions in store operating expenses and corporate administrative expenses resulting from our various cost reduction initiatives 
additionally  we incurred no securitization fees due to our elimination of the receivables securitization facilities on october  these cost reductions were partially offset by an increase in debit and credit card fees  and higher workers compensation and general liability costs due to a reserve reduction caused by favorable claims experience recorded in the prior year

goodwill impairment in fiscal  we impaired all of our existing goodwill  which resulted in a non cash charge of billion 
this entry was required due to the fact that our market value  as indicated by the trading price of our common stock  was less than the carrying value of our net assets as of february  lease termination and impairment charges lease termination and impairment charges consist of amounts and number of locations as follows year ended february  weeks february  weeks february  weeks dollars in thousands impairment charges facility and equipment lease exit charges number of stores number of distribution centers lease exit charges number of stores number of distribution centers 
table of contents impairment charges 
these amounts include the write down of long lived assets to estimated fair value at stores that were identified for impairment as part of our on going store performance review at all of our stores or management intention to relocate or close a specific store 
facility and equipment lease exit charges 
charges to close a store  which principally consist of lease termination costs  are recorded at the time the store is closed and all inventory is liquidated  pursuant to the guidance set forth in asc  exit or disposal cost obligations 
we calculate our liability for closed stores on a store by store basis 
the calculation includes the discounted effect of future minimum lease payments and related ancillary costs  from the date of closure to the end of the remaining lease term  net of estimated cost recoveries that may be achieved through subletting properties or favorable lease terminations 
we evaluate these assumptions each quarter and adjust the liability accordingly 
as part of our ongoing business activities  we assess stores and distribution centers for potential closure 
decisions to close stores in future periods would result in charges for store lease exit costs and liquidation of inventory  as well as impairment of assets at these stores 
interest expense in fiscal   and  interest expense was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the prior year refinancing of our senior secured credit facility and the elimination of our securitization program which was previously recorded in sg a  partially offset by savings from our current year refinancing of our million senior secured credit facility term loan 
the increase in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to higher cost debt incurred as part of our fiscal refinancing partially offset by lower libor rates and decreased borrowings under the revolving credit facility

net loss for fiscal included income tax expense of million and was primarily comprised of an accrual for state and local taxes  adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits and the need for an accrual of additional state taxes resulting from the receipt of a final audit determination 
we maintain a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
asc  income taxes requires a company to evaluate its deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets is required 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is required  we take into account all available positive and negative evidence with regard to the recognition of a deferred tax asset including our past earnings history  expected future earnings  the character and jurisdiction of such earnings  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect recognition of a deferred tax asset  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax planning strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
a cumulative loss in recent years is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable 
based on the negative evidence  asc precludes relying on projections of future taxable income to support the recognition of deferred tax assets 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the existence of sufficient taxable income generated in the carryforward periods 
the fiscal income tax expense of million was primarily comprised of an accrual for state and local taxes net of federal tax recoveries and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits 
the fiscal income tax expense included non cash tax expense of million related to the write down of 
table of contents our remaining net federal and state deferred tax assets through an adjustment to our valuation allowance 
this change was primarily due to a decline in actual results from our previous forecast as a result of the impact of current economic conditions on fiscal results 
we monitor all available evidence related to our ability to utilize our remaining net deferred tax assets 
we maintained a full valuation allowance of  million and  million against remaining net deferred tax assets at fiscal year end and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources general we have three primary sources of liquidity i cash and cash equivalents  ii cash provided by operating activities  and iii borrowings under the revolving credit facility under our senior secured credit facility 
our principal uses of cash are to provide working capital for operations  to service our obligations to pay interest and principal on debt and to fund capital expenditures 
credit facility our senior secured credit facility consists of a billion revolving credit facility and two term loans 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum between libor plus and libor plus  if we choose to make libor borrowings  or between citibank base rate plus and citibank base rate plus in each case based upon the amount of revolver availability as defined in the senior secured credit facility 
we are required to pay fees between and per annum on the daily unused amount of the revolver  depending on the amount of revolver availability 
amounts drawn under the revolver become due and payable on august   provided that such maturity date shall instead be april  in the event that on or prior to april  we do not repay  refinance or otherwise extend the maturity date of our tranche term loan as defined below to a date that is at least days after august  and  in the case of a repayment or refinancing  we must have at least million of availability under the revolver 
our ability to borrow under the revolver is based upon a specified borrowing base consisting of accounts receivable  inventory and prescription files 
at february   we had million outstanding under the revolver and had letters of credit outstanding against the revolver of million  which resulted in additional borrowing capacity of billion 
the credit facility also includes our billion senior secured term loan the tranche term loan 
the tranche term loan will mature on june  and currently bears interest at a rate per annum equal to libor plus  if we choose to make libor borrowings  or at citibank base rate plus 
we must make mandatory prepayments of the tranche term loan with the proceeds of asset dispositions and casualty events subject to certain limitations  with a portion of any excess cash flow generated by us as defined in the senior secured credit facility and with the proceeds of certain issuances of equity and debt subject to certain exceptions 
if at any time there is a shortfall in our borrowing base under our senior secured credit facility  prepayment of the tranche term loan may also be required 
as of february   we also had a million senior secured term loan the tranche term loan outstanding under our existing senior secured credit facility 
on march   we refinanced the tranche term loan with a million senior secured term loan the tranche term loan 
the tranche term loan matures on march   although the maturity shall instead be december  in the event that we do not repay or refinance our outstanding senior notes due prior to that time  or september   in the event that we do not repay or refinance our outstanding senior notes due prior to that time 
the tranche term loan bears interest at a rate per annum equal to libor plus with a libor floor  and is 
table of contents subject to a prepayment fee in the event it is refinanced within the first year after issuance with the proceeds of a substantially concurrent issuance of new loans or other indebtedness incurred for the primary purpose of repaying  refinancing or replacing the tranche term loan 
we must make mandatory prepayments of the tranche term loan with the proceeds of asset dispositions and casualty events subject to certain limitations  with a portion of any excess cash flow generated by us as defined in the senior secured credit facility and with the proceeds of certain issuances of equity and debt subject to certain exceptions 
if at any time there is a shortfall in our borrowing base under our senior secured credit facility  prepayment of the tranche term loan may also be required 
the senior secured credit facility also restricts us and the subsidiary guarantors from accumulating cash on hand in excess of million at any time when revolving loans are outstanding not including cash located in our store deposit accounts  cash necessary to cover our current liabilities and certain other exceptions and from accumulating cash on hand with revolver borrowings in excess of million over three consecutive business days 
the senior secured credit facility also states that if at any time other than following the exercise of remedies or acceleration of any senior obligations or second priority debt and receipt of a triggering notice by the senior collateral agent from a representative of the senior obligations or the second priority debt either a an event of default exists under our senior secured credit facility or b the sum of revolver availability under our senior secured credit facility and certain amounts held on deposit with the senior collateral agent in a concentration account is less than million for three consecutive business days a cash sweep period  the funds in our deposit accounts will be swept to a concentration account with the senior collateral agent and will be applied first to repay outstanding revolving loans under the senior secured credit facility  and then held as collateral for the senior obligations until such cash sweep period is rescinded pursuant to the terms of our senior secured credit facility 
the senior secured credit facility allows us to have outstanding  at any time  up to billion in secured second priority debt and unsecured debt in addition to borrowings under the senior secured credit facility and existing indebtedness  provided that not in excess of million of such secured second priority debt and unsecured debt shall mature or require scheduled payments of principal prior to three months after june  the senior secured credit facility allows us to incur an unlimited amount of unsecured debt with a maturity beyond three months after june   however  other outstanding indebtedness limits the amount of unsecured debt that can be incurred if certain interest coverage levels are not met at the time of incurrence of said debt 
the senior secured facility also allows  so long as the senior secured credit facility is not in default  for the repurchase of any debt with a maturity on or before june   for the voluntary repurchase of debt with a maturity after june  and the mandatory repurchase of our convertible notes due if we maintain availability on the revolving credit facility of at least million 
our senior secured credit facility contains covenants  which place restrictions on the incurrence of debt beyond the restrictions described above  the payment of dividends  sale of assets  mergers and acquisitions and the granting of liens 
our credit facility has a financial covenant  which is the maintenance of a fixed charge coverage ratio 
the covenant requires that  if availability on the revolving credit facility is less than million  we maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to for the quarter ending february  and for the three subsequent quarters 
this ratio increases to to in the last quarter of fiscal and remains at that level for the remaining term of the facility 
as of february   we were in compliance with this financial covenant 
the senior secured credit facility provides for events of default including nonpayment  misrepresentation  breach of covenants and bankruptcy 
it is also an event of default if we fail to make any required payment on debt having a principal amount in excess of million or any event occurs that enables  or which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time would enable  the holder of such debt to accelerate the maturity or require the repurchase of such debt 
the august amendments 
table of contents to the senior secured credit facility exclude the mandatory repurchase of the convertible notes due from this event of default 
the indentures that govern our secured and guaranteed unsecured notes contain restrictions on the amount of additional secured and unsecured debt that can be incurred by us 
as of february   the amount of additional secured debt that could be incurred under these indentures was approximately billion which amount does not include the ability to enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions 
however  we could not incur any additional secured debt as of february  assuming a fully drawn revolver and the outstanding letters of credit 
the ability to issue additional unsecured debt under these indentures is governed by an interest coverage ratio test 
at the end of march  we made an excess cash flow repayment of million of the tranche term loan and the tranche term loan  as required under our senior secured credit facility 
this excess cash flow payment will be in lieu of scheduled amortization payments over the next three fiscal years

in july  we repurchased million of our million outstanding convertible notes 
the remaining convertible notes require us to maintain a listing on the nyse or certain other exchanges 
in the event of a nyse delisting  holders of these notes could require us to repurchase them  which we have the ability to do under the terms of our senior secured credit facility 
on july  we received a notice of non compliance from the nyse because the price of our common stock has fallen below the nyse minimum share price rule

we accounted for all of these leases as operating leases 
a gain on the sale of these stores of million was deferred and is being recorded over the minimum term of these leases 
transactions on june   we conducted a tender offer and consent solicitation under which we offered to repurchase all outstanding amounts of our senior secured notes due may  our senior secured notes due january and our senior notes due june on july  we repaid million of the outstanding balance of our notes due may  million of our notes due january and million of the outstanding balance of our notes due june pursuant to the tender offer

in addition  the guarantees on each series were eliminated 
we did the transaction because these notes had restrictions on secured debt that prohibited us from fully drawing on our revolving credit facility under certain circumstances 
we incurred a loss on debt modification related to this transaction of million 
these transactions were financed via the issuance of a senior secured term loan the tranche term loan and the issuance of a million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due july these notes are unsecured unsubordinated obligations of rite aid corporation and rank equally in right of payment with all other unsubordinated indebtedness

net proceeds from these sales were million 
concurrent with these sales  we entered into agreements to lease the stores back from the purchasers over minimum lease terms of years 
we accounted for of these leases as operating leases and the remaining five were initially accounted for using the financing method as these lease agreements contain a clause that allow the buyer to force us to repurchase the properties under certain conditions 
a gain on the sale of these stores of million was deferred and is being recorded over the minimum term of these leases 
subsequent to february   the clause that allowed the buyer to force us to repurchase the property lapsed on three of these leases

net cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities cash flow provided by operating activities was million in fiscal cash flow was positively impacted by a reduction in inventory and an increase in accounts payable due to the timing of purchases 
additionally  the reductions in accounts receivable are no longer offset by repayments to the receivables securitization facility which was eliminated in the third quarter of fiscal 
table of contents cash flow used in operating activities was million in fiscal cash flow was negatively impacted by the repayments of the accounts receivable securitization facilities totaling million and a decrease in accounts payable offset by a reduction in inventory and accounts receivable 
the decreases in accounts receivables  inventory and accounts payable were due to operating fewer stores and various working capital initiatives 
cash flow provided by operating activities was million in fiscal cash flow was positively impacted by net proceeds from our accounts receivable securitization  reductions in accounts receivable and inventory  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable 
the decrease in inventory is primarily due to the efforts made by management to reduce excess inventory and a decrease in purchasing volume  which also impacted accounts payable 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal cash was used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment and prescription files which was partially offset by proceeds from asset dispositions cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal cash was used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment and prescription files which was offset in part by proceeds from asset dispositions 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal cash was used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment and prescription files which was offset in part by proceeds from our sale leaseback transactions and proceeds from asset dispositions 
cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal and was primarily due to the refinancing activity that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal  the repurchase of million of the convertible notes  other scheduled debt repayments and a small decrease in our zero balance cash accounts 
cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal due to proceeds from refinancings offset by a reduction in borrowings on our revolving credit facility and the payment of financing fees related to the refinancings 
cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal due to the net impact of proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes and redemption of various notes  amending of our credit facility and principal payments on long term debt 
capital expenditures we plan to make total capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal  consisting of approximately related to the new store construction and store relocation  related to store remodels  related to prescription file purchases and for infrastructure and maintenance requirements 
management expects that these capital expenditures will be financed primarily with cash flow from operating activities and use of the revolving credit facility 
future liquidity we are highly leveraged 
our high level of indebtedness i limits our ability to obtain additional financing  ii limits our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  iii places us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less debt  iv renders us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions  and v requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt 
based upon our current levels of operations  we believe that cash flow from operations together with available borrowings under the senior secured credit facility and other sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our requirements for working capital  debt service and capital expenditures at least for the next twelve months 
based on 
table of contents our liquidity position  which we expect to remain strong throughout the year  we do not expect the restriction on our credit facility  that could result if we fail to meet the fixed charge covenant in our senior secured credit facility  to have any impact on our business in the next twelve months 
we will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in light of our operating performance  and other relevant circumstances 
should we determine  at any time  that it is necessary to obtain additional short term liquidity  we will evaluate our alternatives and take appropriate steps to obtain sufficient additional funds 
there can be no assurance that any such supplemental funding  if sought  could be obtained or if obtained  would be on terms acceptable to us 
from time to time  we may seek deleveraging transactions  including entering into transactions to exchange debt for shares of common stock or may seek to refinance our outstanding debt or may otherwise seek transactions to reduce interest expense and extend debt maturities 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory shrink  impairment of long lived assets  revenue recognition  self insurance liabilities  lease exit liabilities  income taxes and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current and anticipated business conditions  the condition of the financial markets and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under existing conditions 
variability reflected in the sensitivity analyses presented below is based on our recent historical experience 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates and sensitivity analyses 
the following critical accounting policies require the use of significant judgments and estimates by management inventory shrink the carrying value of our inventory is reduced by a reserve for estimated shrink losses that occur between physical inventory dates 
when estimating these losses  we consider historical loss results at specific locations including stores and distribution centers  as well as overall loss trends as determined during physical inventory procedures 
the estimated shrink rate is calculated by dividing historical shrink results for stores inventoried in the most recent six months by the sales for the same period 
shrink expense is recognized by applying the estimated shrink rate to sales since the last physical inventory 
there have been no significant changes in the assumptions used to calculate our shrink rate over the last three years 
although possible  we do not expect a significant change to our shrink rate in future periods 
a basis point difference in our estimated shrink rate for the year ended february   would have affected pre tax income by approximately million 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets for impairment annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may not be recoverable 
we have identified each store as an asset group for purposes of performing this evaluation 
our evaluation of whether possible impairment indicators exist includes comparing future cash flows expected to be generated by the store to the carrying value of the store assets 
if the estimated future cash flows of the asset group store level are less than the carrying amount of the store assets  we calculate an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the store assets to the fair value of such assets 
we determine fair value by discounting the estimated future cash flows of the store discussed above 
cash flows are calculated utilizing the detailed store financial plan for the year immediately following the current year end 
to arrive at cash flow estimates for additional future years  we project sales growth by store consistent with our overall business planning objectives and results  and 
table of contents determine the incremental cash flow that such sales growth will contribute to that store operations 
the discount rate used is our credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
the assumptions utilized in calculating impairment are updated annually 
should actual sales growth rates and related incremental cash flow differ from those forecasted and projected  we may incur future impairment charges related to the stores being evaluated 
changes in our discount rate of basis points would not have a material impact on the total impairment recorded in fiscal revenue recognition for all sales other than third party pharmacy sales  we recognize revenue from the sale of merchandise at the time the merchandise is sold 
for third party pharmacy sales  revenue is recognized at the time the prescription is filled  which is or approximates when the customer picks up the prescription 
we record revenue net of an allowance for estimated future returns 
return activity is immaterial to revenues and results of operations in all periods presented 
on april   we launched our wellness loyalty card program chain wide 
we currently have over million members enrolled in this program 
members participating in our wellness loyalty card program earn points on a calendar year basis for eligible front end merchandise purchases and qualifying prescriptions 
one point is awarded for each dollar spent towards front end merchandise and points are awarded for each qualifying prescription 
members reach specific wellness tiers based on the points accumulated during the calendar year  which entitle them to certain future discounts and other benefits upon reaching that tier 
for example  any customer that reaches  points in a calendar year achieves the gold tier  enabling the customer to receive a discount on qualifying purchases of front end merchandise for the remaining portion of the calendar year and the next calendar year 
there are also similar silver and plus levels with lower thresholds and benefit levels 
as wellness customers accumulate points  we defer the retail value of the points earned as deferred revenue included in other current and noncurrent liabilities  based on the expected usage 
the amount deferred is based on historic and projected customer activity eg  tier level  spending level 
as customers receive discounted front end merchandise  we recognize an allocable portion of the deferred revenue 
if the achieved combined gold and silver levels differ from the assumptions by then the revenue deferral changes by million 
if the assumed spending levels  which are the drivers of future discounts  differ by then the revenue deferral changes by million 
self insurance liabilities we expense claims for self insured medical  dental  workers compensation and general liability insurance coverage as incurred including an estimate for claims incurred but not paid 
the expense for self insured medical and dental claims incurred but not paid is determined by multiplying the average claim value paid over the most recent twelve months by the average number of days from the same period between when the claims were incurred and paid 
there have been no significant changes in assumptions used to determine days lag over the last three years 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was previously estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was anticipated  expense recorded may not be sufficient  and additional expense may be recorded 
a one day change in days lag for the year ended february   would have affected pretax income by approximately million 
the expense for self insured workers compensation and general liability claims incurred but not paid is determined using several factors  including historical claims experience and development  severity of claims  medical costs and the time needed to settle claims 
we discount the estimated expense for workers compensation to present value as the time period from incurrence of the claim to final settlement can be several years 
we base our estimates for such timing on previous settlement activity 
the discount rate is based on the current market rates for treasury bills that approximate the average time to settle the workers compensation claims 
these assumptions are updated on an annual 
table of contents basis 
a basis point difference in the discount rate for the year ended february   would have affected pretax income by approximately million 
lease exit liabilities we record reserves for closed stores based on future lease commitments  anticipated ancillary occupancy costs and anticipated future subleases of properties 
the reserves are calculated at the individual location level and the assumptions are assessed at that level 
the reserve for lease exit liabilities is discounted using a credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
reserve estimates and related assumptions are updated on a quarterly basis 
a substantial amount of our closed stores were closed prior to our adoption of asc  exit or disposal cost obligations 
therefore  if interest rates change  reserves may be increased or decreased 
in addition  changes in the real estate leasing markets can have an impact on the reserve 
as of february   a basis point variance in the credit adjusted risk free interest rate would have affected pretax income by approximately million for fiscal income taxes we currently have net operating loss nol carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future income for federal and state tax purposes 
these nols generate significant deferred tax assets which are currently offset by a valuation allowance 
we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence including our historical profitability  projected taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
the weight given to the potential effect of the negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
we establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
there have been no significant changes in the assumptions used to calculate our valuation allowance over the last three years 
however  changes in market conditions and the impact of the acquisition of brooks eckerd on operations have caused changes in the valuation allowance from period to period which were included in the tax provision in the period of change 
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with asc  income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
litigation reserves we are involved in litigation on an on going basis 
we accrue our best estimate of the probable loss related to legal claims 
such estimates are based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
these estimates are updated as the facts and circumstances of the cases develop and or change 
to the extent additional information arises or our strategies change  it is possible that our best estimate of the probable liability may also change 
changes to these reserves during the last three fiscal years were not material 
non gaap measures in addition to net income determined in accordance with gaap  we use certain non gaap measures  such as adjusted ebitda  in assessing our operating performance 
we believe the non gaap measures serve as an appropriate measure to be used in evaluating the performance of our business 
we define adjusted ebitda as net loss excluding the impact of income taxes  interest expense and securitization costs  depreciation and amortization  lifo adjustments  charges or credits for facility closing and impairment  inventory write downs related to store closings  stock based compensation expense  debt modifications and retirements  sale of assets and investments  revenue deferrals related to customer loyalty programs and other items 
we reference this particular non gaap financial measure frequently in our decision making because it provides supplemental information that facilitates internal comparisons to the historical operating performance of prior periods and external 
table of contents comparisons to competitors historical operating performance in addition  incentive compensation is based on adjusted ebitda and we base certain of our forward looking estimates on adjusted ebitda to facilitate quantification of planned business activities and enhance subsequent follow up with comparisons of actual to planned adjusted ebitda 
the following is a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to our net loss for fiscal  and february  weeks february  weeks february  weeks net loss interest expense and securitization costs income tax expense depreciation and amortization expense lifo charges goodwill impairment charge lease termination and impairment charges stock based compensation expense gain loss on sale of assets  net loss on debt modifications and retirements  net incremental acquisition costs closed facility liquidation expense severance costs customer loyalty card programs revenue deferral other adjusted ebitda in addition to adjusted ebitda  we occasionally refer to several other non gaap measures  on a less frequent basis  in order to describe certain components of our business and how we utilize them to describe our results 
these measures include but are not limited to ebitda gross margin gross margin adjusted for non ebitda items  ebitda sg a sg a expenses adjusted for non ebitda items  fifo gross margin gross margin before lifo charges and free cash flow cash provided from operations less cash used in investing activities 
we include these non gaap financial measures in our earnings announcements and guidance in order to provide transparency to our investors and enable investors to better compare our operating performance with the operating performance of our competitors including with those of our competitors having different capital structures 
adjusted ebitda or other non gaap measures above should not be considered in isolation from  and is not intended to represent an alternative measure of  operating results or of cash flows from operating activities  as determined in accordance with gaap 
our definition of these non gaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements reported by other companies 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future earnings  cash flow and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense 
we enter into debt obligations to support capital expenditures  acquisitions  working capital needs and general corporate purposes 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of variable rate credit facilities  fixed rate long term obligations and derivative transactions 
we currently do not have any derivative transactions outstanding 
the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal payments and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates as of february  thereafter total fair value at february  dollars in thousands long term debt  including current portion  excluding capital lease obligations fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate our ability to satisfy our interest payment obligations on our outstanding debt will depend largely on our future performance  which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
if we do not have sufficient cash flow to service our interest payment obligations on our outstanding indebtedness and if we cannot borrow or obtain equity financing to satisfy those obligations  our business and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
we cannot be assured that any replacement borrowing or equity financing could be successfully completed 
the interest rate on our variable rate borrowings  which include our revolving credit facility and our tranche term loans and tranche term loans  are all based on libor 
however  the interest rate on our tranche term loans has a libor floor of basis points 
if the market rates of interest for libor changed by basis points as of february   our annual interest expense would change by approximately million 
a change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixed rate debt instruments 
as fixed rate debt matures  however  and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment  future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates 
this effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures
