for nearly years  we have innovated technologies that help companies and individuals to meet and collaborate in a more productive and efficient way 
we have a global presence in countries in our three segments in north america  europe and asia pacific 
during and  we continued our strategy to transition pgi to a virtual meetings company 
to that end  we initiated a plan to divest our pgimarket business during the third quarter of and completed its sale on november  on october   we completed the sale of our pgisend business  which was initiated during the fourth quarter of during  we classified our maritime notification and reminder solutions operations as a disposal group held for sale 
our continuing operations reflect only our virtual meeting solutions 
prior period results in the following discussion and analysis have been reclassified to present these businesses as discontinued operations 
as a result  and except as provided herein  the following discussion and analysis reflects our results from continuing operations 
key highlights of our financial and strategic accomplishments for include generated approximately and volume growth for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  compared to the same periods in  decreased our total debt less cash and equivalents by over from million at december  to million at december refinanced our existing credit facility that was scheduled to mature in april with a new  four year facility that matures in may  completed the sale of our pgisend business allowing us to become focused on the virtual meeting market  retired our million term a loan with proceeds from our pgisend sale  and repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock through a cash self tender offer for approximately million 
our primary corporate objectives in are focused on continuing to develop and launch innovative software applications that enable our customers to have more enjoyable and productive virtual meetings  and transition our customers to more integrated  online collaboration solutions that provide a simple  intuitive and visually rich user experience 
specifically  in  our strategic plan includes a continued focus on expanding the delivery options for our services beyond our traditional software as a service model to new models  such as dedicated hosting and managed services 
we are also focused on establishing our new virtual meeting solutions  imeet and globalmeet  in the market 
we believe these strategic initiatives will increase the addressable market opportunity for pgi and our solutions 
in  approximately of our consolidated net revenues were generated in countries outside the united states 
because we generate a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues from our international operations  movements in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results 
we estimate that changes in foreign currency exchange rates during favorably impacted our consolidated net revenues by approximately million as compared to we have historically generated net revenue growth in our meeting solutions 
the average rate per minute that we charge our customers continues to decline while total minutes sold continues to increase 
we believe that this trend is consistent with the industry  and we expect it to continue in the foreseeable future 
our business trends and revenue growth continue to be affected by the challenging economic climate  higher global unemployment and lower global business activity 
despite continued volume growth  price compression caused consolidated net revenues to decline to million in as compared to million in we have historically used our cash flows from operating activities for debt repayments  acquisitions  capital expenditures and stock repurchases 
as of december   borrowings under our credit facility were million 
in may  we closed the refinancing of our prior credit facility by entering into a new  four year million credit facility  which consisted of a million revolver  a million term a loan and an uncommitted million accordion feature 
on october   a portion of the proceeds from our pgisend sale were used to retire our million term a loan  reducing the availability on our credit facility to million  including the uncommitted million accordion feature 
see capital resources for a description of our credit facility 
we used the remainder of the pgisend sale proceeds plus additional borrowings on our credit facility to fund our approximately million tender offer  as well as to pay certain transactions fees and closing costs related to the sale and the tender offer 
in addition  we intend to continue to prudently invest in our virtual meeting solutions  specifically in technology innovation and platform development  as well as new market strategies to better meet the needs of our large  global enterprise customers and to better attract  engage and acquire small and medium size business customers 
we currently anticipate an increase in selling and marketing expense in as compared to relating to the commercial releases of our imeet and globalmeet services 
we will also continue to evaluate our cost structure in to ensure that our businesses are operating as efficiently as possible 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from the estimates

on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for uncollectible accounts  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring costs  legal contingencies and derivative instruments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates

should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable prior to the recognition of revenue  we make a decision that collectability is reasonably assured 
over time  management analyzes accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  changes in our customer payment terms and other trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 
significant management judgment and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable in any accounting period 
the accounts receivable balance was million and million  net of allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable of million and million  as of december  and  respectively 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment to their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets we evaluate intangible assets and long lived assets for potential impairment indicators whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that management considers important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant decrease in the market value of an asset  significant adverse change in physical condition or manner of use of an asset  significant adverse change in legal factors or negative industry or economic trends  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and an expectation that  more likely than not  an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
goodwill is not subject to amortization but is subject to an annual impairment review 
we completed these reviews as of december   and we did not recognize an impairment of our goodwill during with our pgisend sale  but we did dispose of goodwill associated with that business in connection with the sale 
we recognized an impairment of our goodwill in associated with the sale of our pgimarket business 
see discontinued operations 
other intangible assets with finite lives continue to be amortized 
we recognize an impairment loss when the fair value is less than the carrying value of such assets and the carrying value of these assets is not recoverable 
the impairment loss  if applicable  is calculated based on the discounted estimated future cash flows using our weighted average cost of capital compared to the carrying value of the long lived asset 
net intangible assets and goodwill amounted to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
future events could cause us to conclude that the current estimates used should be changed and that goodwill and intangible assets associated with acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves significant management judgment in estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  an expense is recorded within the tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations 
our net deferred tax liability as of december  was million and our net deferred tax asset as of december  was million  net of valuation allowances of million and million  respectively 
we have recorded our valuation allowance due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and capital losses carried forward 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance or reverse an existing valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at december  and was million and million  respectively  all of which  if recognized  would affect our annual effective tax rate 
we also have reserves for certain asserted international  federal and state tax contingencies based on the likelihood of obligation 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to inquiries from us and non us tax authorities regarding the amount of income taxes due 
these challenges may result in adjustments of the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions 
further  during the ordinary course of business  other facts and circumstances may impact our ability to utilize tax benefits as well as the estimated income taxes to be paid in future periods 
we believe we have appropriately accrued for tax exposures 
if we are required to pay an amount less than or exceeding our provisions for uncertain tax matters  the financial impact will be reflected in the period in which the matter is resolved 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  we may need to adjust tax accounts which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
restructuring costs restructuring accruals are based on certain estimates and judgments related to severance and exit costs  contractual lease obligations and related costs 
our estimated severance costs could be impacted if actual severance payments are different from initial estimates 
contractual lease obligations could be materially affected by factors such as our ability to secure sublessees  the creditworthiness of sublessees and the success at negotiating early termination agreements with lessors 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  we may need to establish additional restructuring accruals or reverse accrual amounts accordingly 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain litigation matters as disclosed in part i item legal proceedings and note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report 
we accrue an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of legal claims 
these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel handling these matters and based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
our estimates are subject to change  and we adjust the financial impact in the period in which such matters are resolved 
derivative instruments we have used derivative instruments from time to time to manage risks related to interest rates 
during the years ended december  and  our derivative instruments were limited to interest rate swaps 
we are exposed to one month libor interest rate risk on our credit facility 
in august  we entered into two million pay fixed  receive floating interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in our cash flows associated with changes in one month libor interest rates 
one of these interest rate swaps expired in august and the other expired in august  so there is no associated asset or liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  for a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the derivative s gain loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and is subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings 
gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in current earnings 
monthly settlements with the counterparties are recognized in the same line item  interest expense  as the interest costs associated with our credit facility 
concurrent with the refinancing of our credit facility on may   we dedesignated the cash flow hedge associated with our remaining interest rate swap  which expired in august subsequent events in march  through the filing of this annual report  we repurchased an aggregate of  shares of our common stock in the open market pursuant to our board approved stock repurchase program for approximately million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and the timing of intercompany payable settlements 
from time to time  we may enter into interest rate swaps to reduce our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates on interest payments associated with our credit facility 
however  our million interest rate swap  which had a fixed rate of  expired in august as of december   we have no outstanding swaps 
at december   we had borrowings of approximately million outstanding under our credit facility that are subject to interest rate risk 
each basis point increase or decrease in interest rates relative to these borrowings would impact our annual pre tax earnings and cash flows by approximately million based on our december  debt level 
we generated approximately of our consolidated net revenues and of our operating expenses in countries outside of the united states in additionally  we have foreign currency denominated debt as part of our credit facility 
at december   we had debt outstanding of cad million and aud million 
as a result  fluctuations in exchange rates impact the amount of our reported consolidated net revenues  operating income and debt 
a hypothetical positive or negative change of in foreign currency exchange rates would positively or negatively change our consolidated net revenues for by approximately million  operating expenses for by approximately million and outstanding debt by approximately million 
our principal exposure has been related to local currency sales and operating costs in australia  canada  the euro zone  japan  norway and the united kingdom 
we have not used derivatives to manage foreign currency exchange risk  and we did not have any foreign currency exchange derivatives outstanding at december
