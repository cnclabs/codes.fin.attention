table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview capstead operates as a self managed reit and earns income from investing in a leveraged portfolio of residential mortgage pass through securities consisting almost exclusively of arm agency securities 
management believes this strategy can produce attractive risk adjusted returns over the long term while substantially eliminating credit risk and reducing  but not eliminating  sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
capstead finances its investments with borrowings under repurchase arrangements with commercial banks and other financial institutions supported by its long term investment capital 
the company s long term investment capital increased million during to billion as of december   consisting of million in common stockholders equity  million of perpetual preferred stockholders equity recorded amounts and million of long term unsecured borrowings net of related investments in statutory trusts 
the company s holdings of residential mortgage investments increased million during the year to billion as of december   while repurchase arrangements and similar borrowings increased million to billion 
with this portfolio growth  which all occurred during the fourth quarter of  portfolio leverage borrowings under repurchase arrangements divided by long term investment capital increased to to one at december  from to one at december  primarily as a result of a sharp increase in mortgage prepayments between march and july of associated with buyouts by the gses of seriously delinquent loans from their guarantee portfolios  average portfolio balances and resulting leverage levels were significantly lower throughout much of compared to beginning or ending balances and leverage levels 
the resulting higher mortgage prepayments had a significant impact on earnings  particularly in the second and third quarters of the year  primarily because investment premium amortization increased and portfolio balances declined 
additionally  earnings for were impacted by lower yields on acquisitions as well as lower coupon interest rates on arm loans underlying the portfolio that reset to more current interest rates 
with the conclusion of fannie mae s buyout program in july  prepayments moderated considerably contributing to improved earnings for the fourth quarter of as investment premium amortization moderated and capital was redeployed 
for the year ended december   capstead reported net income of million or per diluted common share 
this compares to net income of million or per diluted common share for  which included impairment and related charges of over million taken to substantially reduce remaining exposure associated with investments in commercial real estate loans 
the size and composition of capstead s investment portfolio depends on investment strategies being implemented by management  the availability of investment capital as well as overall market conditions  including the availability of attractively priced investments and suitable financing to appropriately leverage the company s investment capital 
market conditions are influenced by  among other things  current levels of  and expectations for future levels of  short term interest rates  mortgage prepayments and market liquidity 
risk factors and critical accounting policies under the captions risk factors and critical accounting policies are discussions of risk factors and critical accounting policies affecting capstead s financial condition and earnings that are an integral part of this discussion and analysis 
readers are strongly urged to consider the potential impact of these factors and accounting policies on the company and its financial results 

table of contents book value per common share nearly all of capstead s mortgage investments and all of its interest rate swap agreements are reflected at fair value on the company s balance sheet and are therefore included in the calculation of book value per common share total stockholders equity  less liquidation preferences of the company s series a and b preferred shares  divided by common shares outstanding 
the fair value of these positions is impacted by market conditions  including changes in interest rates  and the availability of financing at reasonable rates and leverage levels 
the company s investment strategy attempts to mitigate these risks by focusing almost exclusively on investments in agency securities  which are considered to have little  if any  credit risk and are collateralized by arm loans with interest rates that reset periodically to more current levels 
because of these characteristics  the fair value of capstead s portfolio is considerably less vulnerable to significant pricing declines caused by credit concerns or rising interest rates compared to portfolios that contain a significant amount of non agency or fixed rate mortgage securities 
the following table illustrates the progression of book value per common share during the three years in the period ending december  book value per common share  beginning of year increase attributed to capital transactions dividend distributions less than in excess of earnings increase decrease in fair value of mortgage securities classified as available for sale increase decrease in fair value of interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges of repurchase arrangements and similar borrowings unsecured borrowings book value per common share  end of year increase decrease in book value per common share during the indicated year book value during benefited from an increase in value of million notional amount of forward starting  three month libor indexed  swap agreements entered into in october with average fixed rates of and year terms coinciding with the floating rate terms of the company s long term unsecured borrowings that begin in and and end with their and maturities 
these swaps serve to lock in average borrowing rates of compared to current fixed rates of for the final years of these borrowings 
residential mortgage investments the following table progresses capstead s portfolio of residential mortgage investments for the year ended december  in thousands residential mortgage investments  beginning of year increase in unrealized gains on securities held available for sale portfolio acquisitions principal amount at purchased yields of investment premiums on acquisitions portfolio runoff principal amount investment premium amortization residential mortgage investments  end of year capstead s investment strategy focuses on managing a large portfolio of residential mortgage investments consisting almost exclusively of arm agency securities 
agency securities carry an implied aaa rating with limited  if any  credit risk because the timely payment of principal and interest is guaranteed by the gses  which are federally chartered corporations  or an agency of the federal government  ginnie mae 
the conservatorship of the gses by their federal regulator  and related capital commitments 
table of contents to the gses made by the us treasury  have largely alleviated market concerns regarding the ability of the gses to fulfill their guarantee obligations 
by focusing on investing in relatively short duration arm agency securities  declines in fair value caused by increases in interest rates are typically relatively modest compared to investments in longer duration  fixed rate assets duration is a common measure of market price sensitivity to interest rate movements 
these declines are generally recoverable in a relatively short period of time as coupon interest rates on the underlying mortgage loans reset to rates more reflective of the then current interest rate environment allowing for the potential recovery of financing spreads diminished during periods of rising interest rates 
arm securities are backed by residential mortgage loans that have coupon interest rates that adjust at least annually to more current interest rates or begin doing so after an initial fixed rate period 
after the initial fixed rate period  if applicable  mortgage loans underlying arm securities either i adjust annually based on specified margins over the one year constant maturity us treasury note rate cmt or the one year london interbank offered rate libor  ii adjust semiannually based on specified margins over six month libor  or iii adjust monthly based on specified margins over indexes such as one month libor or the eleventh district federal reserve bank cost of funds index  or over a rolling twelve month average of the one year cmt index  usually subject to periodic and lifetime limits  or caps  on the amount of such adjustments during any single interest rate adjustment period and over the contractual term of the underlying loans 
the company classifies its arm securities based on each security s average number of months until coupon reset months to roll 
months to roll is an indicator of asset duration 
current reset arm securities have a months to roll of less than months while longer to reset arm securities have a months to roll of months or greater 
after consideration of any applicable initial fixed rate periods  at december  approximately  and of the company s arm securities were backed by mortgage loans that reset annually  semi annually and monthly  respectively 
additionally  at december  approximately of the company s current reset arm securities have reached an initial coupon reset  while none of its longer to reset arm securities have reached an initial coupon reset 
all percentages are approximate and based on averages of the characteristics of mortgage loans underlying each security and calculated using unpaid principal balances 
as of december   the company s arm securities featured the following characteristics dollars in thousands arm type basis a net wac b fully indexed wac b average net margins b average periodic caps b average lifetime caps b months to roll current reset arms fannie mae agency securities freddie mac agency securities ginnie mae agency securities residential mortgage loans longer to reset arms fannie mae agency securities freddie mac agency securities ginnie mae agency securities a basis represents the company s investment unpaid principal balance plus unamortized investment premium before unrealized gains and losses 
as of december   the ratio of basis to related unpaid principal balance for the company s arm securities was 
this table excludes million in fixed rate agency securities  million in fixed rate residential mortgage loans and million in private residential mortgage pass through securities held as collateral for structured financings 
b net wac  or weighted average coupon  is presented net of servicing and other fees and represents the cash yield inherent in the portfolio as of the indicated date before amortization of investment premiums 
fully indexed wac represents the weighted average coupon upon one or more resets using interest rate indexes and net margins as of the indicated date 
average net margins represents the weighted average level over the underlying indexes that the portfolio can adjust to upon reset  usually subject to periodic and lifetime limits  or caps  on the amount of such adjustments during any single interest rate adjustment period and over the contractual term of the underlying loans 

table of contents capstead generally pledges its residential mortgage investments as collateral under uncommitted repurchase arrangements  the terms and conditions of which are negotiated on a transaction by transaction basis with commercial banks and other financial institutions  referred to as counterparties  when each borrowing is initiated or renewed 
repurchase arrangements involve the sale and a simultaneous agreement to repurchase the transferred assets or similar assets at a future date 
the amount borrowed is generally equal to the fair value of the assets pledged less an agreed upon haircut 
at december  haircuts for pledged agency securities typically ranged from three to five percent of the fair value of the pledged assets  exclusive of monthly principal and interest remittance receivables 
repurchase arrangements entered into by the company are accounted for as financings and require the repurchase of the transferred securities at the end of each arrangement s term  typically to days 
the company maintains the beneficial interest in the specific securities pledged during the term of the repurchase arrangement and receives the related principal and interest payments 
interest rates on these borrowings are fixed based on prevailing rates corresponding to the terms of the borrowings  and interest is paid at the termination of the repurchase arrangement at which time the company may enter into a new repurchase arrangement at prevailing market rates with the same counterparty or repay that counterparty and negotiate financing with a different counterparty 
in response to declines in fair value of pledged securities due to changes in market conditions or the publishing of monthly security paydown factors  lenders typically require the company to post additional securities as collateral  pay down borrowings or establish cash margin accounts with the counterparties in order to re establish the agreed upon collateral requirements  referred to as margin calls 
the company s borrowings under repurchase arrangements at december  consisted of billion of primarily day borrowings with counterparties at average rates of  before the effects of interest rate swap agreements held as cash flow hedges on a designated portion of to day borrowings see below 
weighted average effective interest rates on repurchase arrangements and similar borrowings  including the effects of the interest rate swap agreements  were as of december  and for the year ended december  the company uses two year term  one and three month libor indexed  pay fixed  receive variable  interest rate swap agreements to mitigate exposure to higher short term interest rates 
variable payments received by the company under its swap agreements largely offset interest accruing on a like amount of the company s to day borrowings leaving the fixed rate payments to be paid on the swap agreements as the company s effective borrowing rate  subject to certain adjustments including the effects of measured hedge ineffectiveness and changes in spreads between variable rates on the swap agreements and related actual borrowing rates 
under the terms of currently paying interest rate swap agreements held at december   the company pays fixed rates of interest averaging on notional amounts totaling billion with an average maturity of months 
additionally  the company entered into several forward starting two year swap agreements with notional amounts totaling million that began paying fixed rates of interest averaging in january and will expire in january after consideration of all swap positions entered into as of year end to hedge short term borrowing rates  the company s residential mortgage investments and related borrowings under repurchase arrangements had durations of approximately months and months  respectively  for a net duration gap of approximately months at december  the company intends to continue to manage interest rate risk associated with holding and financing its residential mortgage investments by utilizing suitable derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swap agreements as well as longer dated committed borrowings if available at attractive terms 
in february the gses announced plans to buy out a backlog of seriously delinquent loans from their mortgage guarantee portfolios 
freddie mac largely completed its buyout program in february reflected in march portfolio runoff and fannie mae completed its buyout program in june reflected in july portfolio runoff 
portfolio runoff averaged a constant prepayment rate  or cpr for the year ended december  from august through december of  annualized portfolio runoff averaged or cpr and in january portfolio runoff declined further to an annualized rate 
table of contents of a cpr 
february runoff increased to approximately or cpr as a result of buyouts by freddie mac of seriously delinquent loans with relatively low coupon interest rates that had not been previously repurchased in fannie mae repurchases of seriously delinquent loans with low coupon interest rates were reflected in july portfolio runoff 
management expects the low mortgage prepayment levels experienced between august and january to be more indicative of what can be expected for the rest of given the favorable prepay characteristics of our portfolio of seasoned  relatively low coupon arm securities now that the gse buyout programs have been completed 
since capstead typically purchases investments at a premium to the asset s unpaid principal balance  high levels of mortgage prepayments can put downward pressure on arm security yields and financing spreads because the level of mortgage prepayments impacts how quickly investment premiums are written off against earnings as portfolio yield adjustments 
because of the uncertainties surrounding the extent and timing of the gse buyout programs when they were first announced in february  the company only partially replaced portfolio runoff during the first quarter of resulting in a million principal amount decline in portfolio size during the first quarter 
for the remainder of the year  acquisitions outpaced portfolio runoff by million principal amount  contributing to an overall increase in the portfolio of million since the beginning of the year 
as a result  portfolio leverage increased to to one at december  compared to a quarter end low of to one at june  and to one at december  depending upon market conditions and other factors  the company may further increase portfolio leverage in commercial investments in and prior years  capstead periodically augmented its core investment strategy with investments in credit sensitive commercial real estate related assets that could earn attractive risk adjusted returns 
in management concluded that it would not pursue additional investments in commercial real estate loans 
with impairment and related charges of over million recorded in  the company substantially reduced its remaining exposure associated with these investments to less than million at december   consisting of collateral associated with two townhome development loans 
through ongoing unit sales during  the company has reduced its remaining exposure to these non core investments to less than million at december  consisting of unsold completed units 
the company remains a participant in the lending group for the four seasons resort in nevis  west indies and could achieve some recovery of its written off  million investment from the eventual disposition of the resort 
the resort re opened in december after having been closed since october as a result of sustaining significant hurricane damage 
unrelated to the company s commercial real estate lending activities  during the company acquired million face amount of aaa rated senior notes issued by one of its lending counterparties 
these notes were repaid in november common equity offerings during the first quarter of capstead raised million in new common equity capital  after underwriting discounts and offering expenses  by issuing  common shares at an average price of per share using its at the market  continuous offering program 
no additional shares were issued using this program in this compares to new common equity capital of million and million raised under this program in and  respectively 
additionally  the company completed a public offering in february raising million in new common equity capital 
the company may raise additional equity capital in future periods while maintaining a disciplined approach to augmenting its existing capital base  focusing on transactions that are accretive to existing common stockholders and providing the resulting proceeds can be deployed at attractive levels 
in keeping with this strategy  in january the company reactivated the continuous offering program raising an additional million in new common equity capital  after expenses  by issuing million common shares at an average price of per share through the end of february 
table of contents utilization of long term investment capital and potential liquidity capstead finances a majority of its holdings of residential mortgage securities with commercial banks and other financial institutions using borrowings under repurchase arrangements supported by the company s long term investment capital 
borrowings under repurchase arrangements generally can be increased or decreased on a daily basis to meet cash flow requirements and otherwise manage capital resources efficiently 
consequently  potential liquidity inherent in the company s investment portfolio is as important as the actual level of cash and cash equivalents carried on the balance sheet 
potential liquidity is affected by  among other things  changes in market value of assets pledged and interest rate swap agreements held as determined by lending and swap counterparties  principal prepayments  collateral requirements of lenders and swap counterparties  and general conditions in the commercial banking and mortgage finance industries 
future levels of portfolio leverage will be dependent upon many factors  including the size and composition of the company s investment portfolio see liquidity and capital resources 
capstead s utilization of its long term investment capital and its estimated potential liquidity were as follows as of december  in comparison with december  in thousands investments a related borrowings capital employed a potential liquidity b balances as of december  mortgage securities and similar investments cash collateral receivable from swap counterparties  net c other assets  net of other liabilities balances as of december  a investments are stated at carrying amounts on the company s balance sheets  which generally reflects management s estimate of fair value as of the indicated dates 
b potential liquidity is based on maximum amounts of borrowings available under existing uncommitted repurchase arrangements considering management s estimate of the fair value of related collateral as of the indicated dates adjusted for other sources of liquidity such as cash and cash equivalents 
c cash collateral receivable from swap counterparties is presented net of cash collateral payable to swap counterparties and the fair value of the company s swap positions as of the indicated date 
in order to prudently and efficiently manage its liquidity and capital resources  capstead attempts to maintain sufficient liquidity reserves to fund borrowing and swap program related margin calls requirements to pledge additional collateral or pay down borrowings under stressed market conditions  including margin calls resulting from monthly principal payments that are not remitted to the company for to days after any given month end  as well as anticipated declines in the market value of pledged assets and swap positions 
in response to deteriorating market conditions  management may reduce the company s portfolio leverage and therefore increase its liquidity by raising new common equity capital  selling mortgage securities and or curtailing the replacement of portfolio runoff 
additionally  management has expanded the number of lending counterparties with whom the company routinely does business which has further increased the company s financial flexibility to address challenging market conditions 
tax considerations of dividends paid on capstead common and preferred shares capstead operates as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
common and preferred dividends are characterized as ordinary taxable income  taxable capital gain  or non taxable return of capital based on the relative amounts of taxable income to total distributions 
taxable income is allocated first to preferred share distributions  with any remaining taxable income allocated to common distributions 
distributions in excess of capstead s taxable income are characterized as return of capital 
stockholders who do not hold their shares in tax deferred accounts such as individual retirement accounts should reduce the tax cost basis of their shares by the amount of any return of capital distributions received 

table of contents return of capital distributions received in excess of tax cost basis should be reported as capital gain 
in some years  capital gain distributions may be made by the company 
any such capital gain distributions would be reported as long term capital gains and would generally be taxed at lower rates than distributions of ordinary income 
due to the complex nature of the applicable tax rules  it is recommended that stockholders consult their tax advisors to ensure proper tax treatment of dividends received 
the characterization of the company s dividends for income tax purposes for the three years ended december  were as follows dividends capital gain a ordinary income a return of capital a common series a preferred series b preferred common series a preferred series b preferred common series a preferred series b preferred a the indicated characterization percentage is applicable to each dividend received with respect to a given tax year

table of contents compared to capstead s net income totaled million or per diluted common share for  compared to million or per diluted common share for which included impairment and related charges of over million taken to substantially reduce future exposure to losses associated with investments in commercial real estate loans 
excluding these charges from results  earnings declined by approximately million as net interest margins declined by million to million 
the decrease in net interest margins can largely be attributed to lower total financing spreads  which averaged basis points for compared to basis points during financing spreads were negatively affected by significantly higher investment premium amortization resulting from a sharp increase in mortgage prepayments between march and july associated with buyouts by the gses of seriously delinquent loans from their guarantee portfolios  as well as lower coupon interest rates on arm loans underlying the portfolio that reset to more current interest rates and lower yields on portfolio acquisitions 
although portfolio leverage ended the year at to one  compared to to one at december   this increase occurred late in the year and therefore had a limited impact on earnings 
yields on interest earning assets averaged basis points lower during compared to reflecting a higher investment premium amortization associated with the gse buyout programs  b lower yields on existing portfolio as coupon interest rates on the underlying mortgage loans continued resetting to rates more reflective of the current rate environment and c lower market yields on acquisitions 
in addition  yields were impacted by lower yields on overnight investments and cash collateral receivable from swap counterparties  also reflecting lower prevailing short term interest rates 
total portfolio runoff averaged on an annualized basis during  compared to in since capstead typically purchases investments at a premium to the asset s unpaid principal balance  the level of mortgage prepayments impacts how quickly these investment premiums are written off against earnings as yield adjustments 
borrowing rates on interest bearing liabilities averaged basis points lower during than during reflecting improved borrowing conditions and lower prevailing short term interest rates  as well as lower rates on interest rate swap positions 
borrowing rates on approximately billion of the company s average borrowings during were effectively fixed through the use of interest rate swap agreements

rates on these borrowings averaged during compared to during in total  other revenue expense during was relatively stable compared to  excluding from consideration the impairment and related charges taken in discussed above 
miscellaneous other revenue expense includes  among other items  operating and sale activity associated with townhome development loans consolidated since the fourth quarter of under variable interest entity accounting rules 
this activity lost  in incentive fees reflect results under a performance based annual employee incentive compensation program that provides for a participation in annual earnings in excess of a benchmark amount and is capped at basis points multiplied by average long term investment capital  as defined under this program 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included under item of this report for additional information regarding the company s compensation programs 
general and administrative expense includes million in primarily legal expenses incurred during the first and second quarters of associated with curtailed efforts to enhance recovery prospects for the company s written off nevis investment 

table of contents compared to capstead s net income totaled million or per diluted common share during compared to million or per diluted common share in results for include impairment and related charges totaling over million taken to substantially reduce future exposure to losses associated with investments in commercial real estate loans 
excluding these charges  earnings increased by approximately million as net interest margins increased by nearly million to million 
this increase reflects the benefits of increased financing spreads on mortgage securities and similar investments 
net interest margins and financing spreads improved as declines in interest income and portfolio yields resulting from lower prevailing interest rates were more than offset by the effects of lower borrowing rates 
portfolio leverage declined from to one at december  to to one by december  due largely to a significant increase in fair value of the company s holdings of agency securities  along with improved interest rate swap valuations and capital raises 
this compares to portfolio leverage of to one at the beginning of total financing spreads averaged basis points during compared to basis points during  having benefited from lower borrowing rates primarily attributable to lower short term interest rates prevailing during average portfolio yields were basis points lower during compared to reflecting a lower yields on existing portfolio as coupon interest rates on the underlying mortgage loans continued resetting to rates more reflective of the current rate environment  b lower market yields on acquisitions and c the curtailment of interest accruals on investments in commercial real estate loans 
in addition  yields were impacted by lower yields on overnight investments and cash collateral receivables from swap counterparties also reflecting lower prevailing short term interest rates 
mortgage prepayments stayed relatively constant year over year and as such did not significantly impact the year over year comparison of yields 
since capstead typically purchases investments at a premium to the asset s unpaid principal balance  the level of mortgage prepayments impacts how quickly these investment premiums are written off against earnings as yield adjustments 
average borrowing rates on interest bearing liabilities declined basis points during compared to approximately billion of the company s average borrowings during were relatively stable in terms of rate because of the use of interest rate swap agreements and longer dated repurchase arrangements to manage interest rate risk

general and administrative expense includes million of legal and other professional service related costs pertaining primarily to the nevis investment  compared to similar costs totaling  in the remainder of the increase in general and administrative expense primarily reflects higher compensation and professional service related costs in large part due to expansion of the company s capital base and operating platform over the past two years  as well as adjustments made in the 
table of contents company s compensation programs 
as part of its efforts to reduce portfolio leverage in the face of contracting market liquidity conditions  during the company sold arm agency securities with a cost basis of million for a loss of million 
no sales of agency securities occurred in liquidity and capital resources capstead s primary sources of funds are borrowings under repurchase arrangements and monthly principal and interest payments on its investments 
other sources of funds may include proceeds from debt and equity offerings and asset sales 
the company generally uses its liquidity to pay down borrowings under repurchase arrangements to reduce borrowing costs and otherwise efficiently manage its long term investment capital 
because the level of these borrowings can generally be adjusted on a daily basis  the company s potential liquidity available under its borrowing arrangements is as important as the level of cash and cash equivalents carried on the balance sheet 
the table included under financial condition utilization of long term investment capital and potential liquidity and accompanying discussion illustrates management s estimate of additional funds potentially available to the company as of december  and the company s perspective on the appropriate level of portfolio leverage to employ under current market conditions 
the company currently believes that it has sufficient liquidity and capital resources available for the acquisition of additional investments when considered appropriate  repayments on borrowings and the payment of cash dividends as required for capstead s continued qualification as a reit 
it is the company s policy to remain strongly capitalized and conservatively leveraged 
capstead has expanded the number of lending counterparties it routinely does business with in order to support larger holdings of residential mortgage investments and to increase its financial flexibility and ability to withstand periods of contracting market liquidity 
the company has uncommitted repurchase facilities with a variety of lending counterparties to finance its portfolio  subject to certain conditions  and had borrowings outstanding with of these counterparties at december  interest rates on borrowings under repurchase arrangements are generally based on prevailing rates at inception corresponding to the terms of the borrowings 
all terms and conditions are negotiated on a transaction by transaction basis 
amounts available to be borrowed under these arrangements are dependent upon the willingness of lenders to participate in the financing of agency securities  lender collateral requirements and the lenders determination of the fair value of the securities pledged as collateral  which fluctuates with changes in interest rates and liquidity conditions within the commercial banking and mortgage finance industries 
borrowings under repurchase arrangements secured by residential mortgage investments totaled billion at december   with maturities of to days 
borrowings under repurchase arrangements averaged billion during the year ended december  average borrowings during the year were lower than at year end primarily due to differences in the timing of portfolio acquisitions relative to portfolio runoff 
mortgage prepayments were unusually high from march to july as a result of the gse buyout programs  which temporarily reduced portfolio balances and therefore borrowing requirements 
capstead uses two year term  one and three month libor indexed  pay fixed  receive variable  interest rate swap agreements to mitigate exposure to higher short term interest rates by effectively locking in fixed rates on a portion of its to day borrowings under repurchase arrangements 
additionally  the company entered into million notional amount of forward starting three month libor indexed  swap agreements with average fixed rates of and year terms coinciding with the floating rate terms of the company s long term unsecured borrowings that begin in and these swaps have effectively locked in fixed rates averaging compared to current fixed rates of for the final years of these borrowings that mature in and at december  currently paying swap agreements entered into by the company had notional amounts totaling billion with an average maturity of months and were designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes of a like

additionally  the company entered into several forward starting swap agreements for this purpose with notional amounts totaling million that began two year terms in january the company intends to continue to manage interest rate risk by utilizing suitable derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swap agreements 
during the first quarter of  the company raised million in new common equity capital through its at the market continuous offering program 
no additional capital was raised under this program in the company raised million and million under this program in and  respectively  and in raised million in a public offering 
the company may raise additional investment capital in future periods while maintaining a disciplined approach to augmenting its capital base  focusing on transactions that are accretive to existing common stockholders and providing the proceeds can be deployed at attractive levels 
in keeping with this strategy  in january the company reactivated the continuous offering program  raising million in new common equity capital through the end of february interest rate sensitivity on operating results capstead performs income sensitivity analyses using an income simulation model to estimate the effects that specific interest rate changes can reasonably be expected to have on future earnings 
all investments  borrowings and derivative financial instruments held are included in these analyses 
the sensitivity of components of other revenue expense to changes in interest rates is included as well  although no asset sales are assumed 
the model incorporates management s assumptions regarding the level of mortgage prepayments for a given interest rate change using market based estimates of prepayment speeds for the purpose of amortizing investment premiums 
these assumptions are developed through a combination of historical analysis and expectations for future pricing behavior under normal market conditions unaffected by changes in market liquidity 
income simulation modeling is the primary tool used by management to assess the direction and magnitude of changes in earnings resulting solely from changes in interest rates 
key assumptions in the model include mortgage prepayment rates  adequate levels of market liquidity  changes in market conditions  portfolio leverage levels  and management s investment capital plans 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely estimate the impact of higher or lower interest rates on earnings 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and other changes in market conditions  management strategies and other factors 
capstead had the following estimated income sensitivity profile at december  and december   respectively dollars in thousands federal funds rate year us treasury rate immediate change in indicated rates day to one year rates flat up up up up year us treasury rate down flat up up up projected month income change december  december  sensitivity of income to changes in interest rates is determined relative to the actual rates at the applicable date 
note that the projected month income change is predicated on acquisitions of similar assets sufficient to replace runoff 
there can be no assurance that suitable investments will be available for purchase at attractive prices or if investments made will behave in the same fashion as assets currently held 

table of contents risk factors an investment in securities issued by capstead involves various risks 
an investor should carefully consider the following risk factors in conjunction with the other information contained in this document before purchasing the company s securities 
the risks discussed herein can adversely affect the company s business  liquidity  operating results  financial condition and future prospects  causing the market price of the company s securities to decline  which could cause an investor to lose all or part of his her investment 
the risk factors described below are not the only risks that may affect the company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company also may adversely affect its business  liquidity  operating results  prospects and financial condition 
risks related to capstead s business potential changes in the relationship between the federal government and the gses could negatively affect capstead s financial condition and earnings 
agency securities have an implied aaa rating because the timely payment of principal and interest on these securities are guaranteed by the gses  or by an agency of the federal government  ginnie mae 
only the guarantee by ginnie mae is explicitly backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government 
the high actual or perceived credit quality of agency securities allows the company to finance its portfolio using repurchase arrangements with relatively low interest rate terms and margin requirements that otherwise would not be available 
as a result of deteriorating housing market conditions that began in  the gses have incurred substantial losses due to high levels of mortgagor defaults  which are ongoing 
in response  in the federal housing finance agency placed the gses into conservatorship  allowing it to operate the gses without forcing them to liquidate 
additionally  the federal government  through the us treasury and the federal reserve  undertook other actions to provide financial support to these entities and the housing market including committing to ensure the gses maintain a positive net worth through through the purchase of preferred stock  and the acquisition by march of trillion in agency securities 
these and other steps taken by the federal government were designed to support market stability and mortgage availability by providing additional confidence to investors in agency securities 
there can be no assurance that the federal government s support for the gses and the market for agency securities will be adequate to achieve these goals 
it is anticipated that over the next several years us policy makers will address what the long term role of the federal government in general  and the gses in particular  will play in the housing markets 
the actual or perceived credit quality of agency securities could be negatively affected by market uncertainty over any legislative or regulatory initiatives that impact the relationship between the gses and the federal government 
a significantly reduced role by the federal government or other changes in the guarantees provided by ginnie mae  the gses or their successors could negatively affect the credit profile and pricing of existing holdings and future issuances of agency securities and whether the company s strategy of holding a leveraged portfolio of agency securities remains viable  which could negatively affect earnings and book value per common share 
in addition  the timing of any sales of agency securities held by the federal reserve or the gses could create volatility in the market pricing of these investments  which could negatively affect book value per common share 
legislative and regulatory actions by the federal government could negatively affect the availability or terms of financing using repurchase arrangements 
in july the us congress enacted the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank in order to restrict certain business practices of systemically significant participants in the financial markets  which include most of the company s lending counterparties 
additionally  dodd frank places restrictions on residential mortgage loan originations and reforms the asset backed securitization markets most notably by imposing credit risk retention requirements 
most of the regulations to implement the provisions of dodd frank 
table of contents have yet to be released so it is unclear how significant of an impact the act will have on the financial markets in general and on the company s strategy of holding a leveraged portfolio of agency securities 
however  it is possible that the availability or terms of financing using repurchase arrangements could be negatively affected 
government supported mortgagor relief programs could negatively affect capstead s financial condition and earnings 
us policy makers have established programs designed to provide qualified homeowners with assistance in avoiding foreclosure or in qualifying for the refinancing of their existing mortgages 
these programs typically entail the pay off of existing mortgages with any losses absorbed by the gses 
these mortgagor relief programs  as well as any future legislative or regulatory actions  could significantly reduce the expected life of the company s residential mortgage investments  therefore  actual yields the company realizes on these investments could be lower due to faster amortization of investment premiums 
additionally  book value per common share can be adversely affected when relatively high coupon mortgage securities that typically have higher valuations prepay 
an increase in prepayments may adversely affect capstead s earnings and book value per common share 
when short and long term interest rates are at nearly the same levels ie  a flat yield curve environment  or when long term interest rates decrease  the rate of principal prepayments on mortgage loans underlying mortgage securities generally increases 
prolonged periods of high mortgage prepayments can significantly reduce the expected life of the company s investments  therefore  actual yields the company realizes can be lower due to faster amortization of investment premiums  which could adversely affect earnings 
additionally  book value per common share can be adversely affected when relatively high coupon mortgage securities that typically are more prone to default and have higher valuations prepay 
changes in interest rates  whether increases or decreases  may adversely affect capstead s earnings 
capstead s earnings currently depend primarily on the difference between the interest received on its mortgage securities and similar investments and the interest paid on its related borrowings 
the company typically finances its investments at to day interest rates 
coupon interest rates on only a portion of the arm loans underlying the company s securities reset each month and the terms of these arm loans generally limit the amount of any increases during any single interest rate adjustment period and over the life of a loan 
consequently  interest rates on related borrowings not hedged through the use of interest rate swap agreements can rise to levels that may exceed yields on these securities in a rising short term interest rate environment 
this can contribute to lower or even negative financing spreads and adversely affect earnings 
at other times  during periods of relatively low short term interest rates  declines in the indices used to determine coupon interest rate resets for arm loans may negatively affect yields on the company s arm securities as the underlying arm loans reset at lower rates 
if declines in these indices exceed declines in the company s borrowing rates  earnings would be adversely affected 
the lack of availability of suitable investments at attractive pricing may adversely affect capstead s earnings 
pricing of investments is determined by a number of factors including interest rate levels and expectations  market liquidity conditions  and competition among investors for these investments  many of whom have greater financial resources and lower return requirements than capstead 
to the extent the proceeds from prepayments on capstead s mortgage investments are not reinvested or cannot be reinvested at rates of return at least equal to the rates previously earned on those investments  the company s earnings may be adversely affected 
similarly  if proceeds from capital raising activities  if any  are not deployed or cannot be deployed at rates of return being earned on existing capital  earnings may be adversely affected 
capstead cannot assure investors that the company will be able to acquire suitable investments at attractive pricing and in a timely manner to replace portfolio runoff as it occurs or to deploy new capital as it is raised 
neither can the company assure investors that it will maintain the current composition of its investments  consisting primarily of arm agency securities 

table of contents periods of illiquidity in the mortgage markets may reduce amounts available to be borrowed under capstead s repurchase arrangements due to declines in the value of related collateral  which could negatively impact the company s financial condition and earnings 
capstead generally finances its investments in mortgage securities by pledging them as collateral under uncommitted repurchase arrangements  the terms and conditions of which are negotiated on a transaction by transaction basis 
the amount borrowed under a repurchase arrangement is limited to a percentage of the estimated market value of the pledged collateral and is specified at the inception of the transaction 
the portion of the pledged collateral held by the lender that is not advanced under the repurchase arrangement is referred to as margin collateral and the resulting margin percentage is required to be maintained throughout the term of the borrowing 
if the market value of the pledged collateral as determined by the company s lenders declines  the company may be subject to margin calls wherein the lender requires the company to pledge additional collateral to reestablish the agreed upon margin percentage 
because market illiquidity tends to put downward pressure on asset prices  capstead may be presented with substantial margin calls during such periods 
if the company is unable or unwilling to pledge additional collateral  the company s lenders can liquidate the company s collateral  potentially under adverse market conditions  resulting in losses 
at such times the company may determine that it is prudent to sell assets to improve its ability to pledge sufficient collateral to support its remaining borrowings  which could result in losses 
periods of illiquidity in the mortgage markets may reduce the number of counterparties willing to lend to the company or the amounts individual counterparties are willing to lend via repurchase arrangements 
capstead will generally pledge its investments in mortgage securities as collateral under uncommitted repurchase arrangements with numerous commercial banks and other financial institutions  routinely with maturities of to days 
the company s ability to achieve its investment objectives depends on its ability to re establish or roll maturing borrowings on a continuous basis 
if a counterparty chooses not to roll a maturing borrowing  the company must pay off the borrowing  generally with cash available from another repurchase arrangement entered into with another counterparty 
if the company determines that it does not have sufficient borrowing capacity with its counterparties  it could be forced to reduce its portfolio leverage by selling assets under potentially adverse market conditions  resulting in losses 
this risk is increased if capstead relies significantly on any single counterparty for a significant portion of its repurchase arrangements 
under these conditions  the company may determine that it is prudent to sell assets to improve its ability to pledge sufficient collateral to support its remaining borrowings  which could result in losses 
periods of rising interest rates may reduce amounts available to be borrowed under capstead s repurchase arrangements due to declines in the perceived fair value of related collateral  which could negatively impact the company s financial condition and earnings 
because rising interest rates tend to put downward pressure on financial asset prices  capstead may be presented with substantial margin calls during such periods 
additionally lenders typically determine what fair value is assigned to collateral for margin call purposes  which can diverge from the company s perspective of fair value during stressed market conditions 
if the company is unable or unwilling to pledge additional collateral  the company s lenders can liquidate the company s collateral  potentially under adverse market conditions  resulting in losses 
at such times the company may determine that it is prudent to sell assets to improve its ability to pledge sufficient collateral to support its remaining borrowings  which could result in losses 
if capstead is unable to negotiate favorable terms and conditions on future repurchase arrangements with one or more of the company s counterparties  the company s financial condition and earnings could be negatively impacted 
the terms and conditions of each repurchase arrangement are negotiated on a transaction by transaction basis  and these borrowings generally are re established  or rolled  at maturity 
key terms and conditions of each transaction include interest rates  maturity dates  asset pricing procedures and margin requirements 
the company cannot assure investors 
table of contents that it will be able to continue to negotiate favorable terms and conditions on its future repurchase arrangements 
also  during periods of market illiquidity or due to perceived credit quality deterioration of the collateral pledged  a lender may require that less favorable asset pricing procedures be employed or margin requirements be increased 
under these conditions  the company may determine it is prudent to sell assets to improve its ability to pledge sufficient collateral to support its remaining borrowings  which could result in losses 
capstead s use of repurchase arrangements to finance its investments may give the company s lenders greater rights in the event of bankruptcy 
borrowings made under repurchase arrangements may qualify for special treatment under the us bankruptcy code 
this may make it difficult for the company to recover its pledged assets if a lender files for bankruptcy and subject the company to losses 
in addition  if the company ever files for bankruptcy  its repurchase arrangement counterparties may be able to avoid the automatic stay provisions of the us bankruptcy code and take possession of  and liquidate  the company s collateral under these arrangements without delay  which could result in losses 
capstead may sell assets for various reasons  including a change in the company s investment focus  which could increase earnings volatility 
capstead may periodically sell assets to enhance its liquidity during periods of market illiquidity or rising interest rates or the company may change its investment focus requiring it to sell some portion of its existing investments 
gains or losses resulting from any such asset sales  or from terminating any related longer dated repurchase arrangements or interest rate swap agreements  will likely increase the company s earnings volatility 
capstead may invest in derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swap agreements to mitigate or hedge the company s interest rate risk  which may negatively affect the company s liquidity  financial condition or earnings 
the company may invest in such instruments from time to time with the goal of achieving more stable borrowing costs and enhancing the company s financial condition 
however  these activities may not have the desired beneficial impact on the company s liquidity  financial condition or earnings 
for instance  the pricing of arm securities and the pricing of related derivatives may deteriorate at the same time leading to margin calls on both the borrowings supporting investments in arm securities and the derivatives  negatively impacting the company s liquidity and stockholders equity 
in addition  counterparties could fail to honor their commitments under the terms of the derivatives or have their credit quality downgraded impairing the value of the derivatives 
in the event of any defaults by counterparties  the company may have difficulty recovering its collateral and may not receive payments provided for under the terms of the derivatives 
should capstead be required to sell its derivatives under such circumstances  the company may incur losses 
no such hedging activity can completely insulate the company from the risks associated with changes in interest rates and prepayment rates 
derivative financial instruments held may fail to qualify for hedge accounting introducing potential volatility to capstead s earnings 
the company typically qualifies derivative financial instruments held as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes in order to record the effective portion of the change in fair value of derivatives as a component of stockholders equity rather than in earnings 
if the hedging relationship for any derivative held ceases to qualify for hedge accounting treatment for any reason  including failing to meet documentation and ongoing hedge effectiveness requirements  the company would be required to record in earnings the total change in fair value of any such derivative 
in addition the company could elect to no longer avail itself of cash flow hedge accounting for its derivative positions 
such a change could introduce a potentially significant amount of volatility to earnings reported by the company 

table of contents capstead is dependent on its executives and employees and the loss of one or more of its executive officers could harm the company s business and its prospects 
as a self managed reit with fewer than employees  capstead is dependent on the efforts of its key officers and employees  most of whom have significant experience in the mortgage industry 
although the company s named executive officers and many of its other employees are parties to severance agreements  the company s key officers and employees are not subject to employment agreements with non compete clauses  nor has capstead acquired key man life insurance policies on any of these individuals 
the loss of any of their services could have an adverse effect on the company s operations 
capstead s remaining commercial real estate investments may expose investors to loss 
capstead s remaining commercial real estate investments consist of loans secured by two townhome development properties 
the company consolidates these townhome properties for accounting purposes 
recovery of the company s investment is dependent upon the sale of remaining townhome units for adequate consideration 
cash flows from unit sales may not be sufficient to cover ongoing operating expenses and recover all of the company s investments resulting in losses 
risks related to capstead s status as a reit and other tax matters if capstead does not qualify as a reit  the company will be subject to tax as a regular corporation and face substantial tax liability 
capstead has elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes and intends to continue to so qualify 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which only a limited number of judicial or administrative interpretations exist 
even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize the company s reit status 
furthermore  new tax legislation  administrative guidance or court decisions  in each instance potentially with retroactive effect  could make it more difficult or impossible for the company to qualify as a reit 
if capstead fails to qualify as a reit in any tax year  then the company would be taxed as a regular domestic corporation  which  among other things  means that the company would be unable to deduct dividends paid to its stockholders in computing taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates  any resulting tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to stockholders  and the company would not be required to make income distributions  and unless capstead were entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions  the company would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the subsequent four taxable years and  as a result  the company s cash available for distribution to stockholders would be reduced during these years 
even if capstead remains qualified as a reit  the company may face other tax liabilities that reduce its earnings 
even if capstead remains qualified for taxation as a reit  the company may be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on its income and assets 
for example  the company will be required to pay tax on any undistributed reit taxable income  may be subject to the alternative minimum tax on any tax preference items  and may operate taxable reit subsidiaries subject to tax on any taxable income earned 
complying with reit requirements may limit capstead s ability to hedge effectively 
the reit provisions of the code may limit capstead s ability to hedge mortgage securities and related borrowings by requiring it to limit its income in each year from qualified hedges entered into prior to july   together with any other income not generated from qualified real estate assets  to no more than of 
table of contents gross income 
in addition  the company must limit its aggregate income from nonqualified hedging transactions  from providing certain services  and from other non qualifying sources to not more than of annual gross income 
as a result  the company may have to limit its use of advantageous hedging techniques 
this could result in greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than the company would otherwise incur 
if the company were to violate the or limitations  it may have to pay a penalty tax equal to the amount of gross income in excess of those limitations  multiplied by a fraction intended to reflect its profitability 
if the company fails to satisfy the reit gross income tests it could lose its reit status for federal income tax purposes unless the failure was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 
complying with reit requirements may cause capstead to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 
to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  capstead must continually satisfy tests concerning  among other things  the sources of its income  the nature and diversification of its assets  the amounts that it distributes to its stockholders  and the ownership of its stock 
the company may be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when it does not have funds readily available for distribution 
as a result  compliance with the reit requirements may hinder the company s ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits 
complying with reit requirements may force capstead to liquidate otherwise attractive investments 
to qualify as a reit  capstead must also ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least of the value of its assets consists of cash  cash items  united states government securities and qualified reit real estate assets 
the remainder of the company s investments in securities other than government securities and qualified real estate assets generally cannot include more than of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer 
in addition  in general  no more than of the value of the company s assets other than government securities and qualified real estate assets can consist of the securities of any one issuer  and no more than of the value of its total securities can be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries 
if the company fails to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter  it must correct such failure within days after the end of the calendar quarter to avoid losing its reit status and suffering adverse tax consequences 
as a result  the company may be required to liquidate otherwise attractive investments 
complying with reit requirements may force capstead to borrow to make distributions to stockholders 
as a reit  capstead must distribute at least of its annual taxable income subject to certain adjustments to its stockholders 
to the extent that the company satisfies the distribution requirement  but distributes less than of its taxable income  the company will be subject to federal corporate income tax on its undistributed taxable income 
in addition  the company will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that it pays out to its stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the federal tax laws 
from time to time  the company may generate taxable income greater than its net income for financial reporting purposes or its taxable income may be greater than the company s cash flow available for distribution to stockholders 
if the company does not have other funds available in these situations  it could be required to borrow funds  sell investments at disadvantageous prices or find another alternative source of funds to make distributions sufficient to enable it to pay out enough of its taxable income to satisfy the distribution requirement and to avoid corporate income tax or the excise tax in a particular year 
these alternatives could increase the company s costs or reduce its long term investment capital 
capstead may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could reduce the market price of the company s securities 
at any time  the federal income tax laws governing reits or the administrative interpretations of those laws may change 
any such changes in laws or 
table of contents interpretations thereof may apply retroactively and could adversely affect capstead or its stockholders 
capstead cannot predict any impact on the value of its securities from adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes 
an investment in capstead s securities has various federal  state and local income tax risks that could affect the value of an investor s investment 
the company strongly urges investors to consult their own tax advisor concerning the effects of federal  state and local income tax law on an investment in the company s securities  because of the complex nature of the tax rules applicable to reits and their stockholders 
risk factors related to capstead s corporate structure there are no assurances of capstead s ability to pay dividends in the future 
capstead intends to continue paying quarterly dividends and to make distributions to its stockholders in amounts such that all or substantially all of the company s taxable income in each year  subject to certain adjustments  is distributed 
this  along with other factors  should enable the company to qualify for the tax benefits accorded to a reit under the internal revenue code 
however  the company s ability to pay dividends may be adversely affected by the risk factors described in this filing 
all distributions will be made at the discretion of the company s board of directors and will depend upon the company s earnings  its financial condition  maintenance of its reit status and such other factors as the board may deem relevant from time to time 
there are no assurances of the company s ability to pay dividends in the future 
failure to maintain an exemption from the investment company act of would adversely affect capstead s results of operations 
the investment company act of the act exempts from regulation as an investment company any entity that is primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on  and interests in  real estate 
capstead believes that it conducts its business in a manner that allows the company to avoid registration as an investment company under the act 
if the company were to be regulated as an investment company  its ability to use leverage would be substantially reduced and it would be unable to conduct business as described in this filing 
the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec has interpreted the provisions of the act to generally require reits that invest primarily in agency securities such as capstead to maintain at least of its assets directly in qualifying real estate interests in order to be exempt from regulation as an investment company 
to constitute a qualifying real estate interest under this requirement  a real estate interest must meet various criteria 
in satisfying this requirement  the company may treat mortgage securities issued with respect to an underlying pool to which it holds all issued certificates as qualifying real estate interests 
mortgage securities that do not represent all of the certificates issued with respect to an underlying pool of mortgages may be treated as securities separate from the underlying mortgage loans and  thus  may not qualify for purposes of the requirement 
if the sec or its staff adopts a contrary interpretation of the act  in order to avoid being regulated as an investment company the company could be required to sell a substantial amount of its securities or other non qualified assets under potentially adverse market conditions which could result in losses 
pursuant to capstead s charter  its board of directors has the ability to limit ownership of the company s capital stock  to the extent necessary to preserve its reit qualification 
for the purpose of preserving capstead s reit qualification  its charter gives the board the ability to repurchase outstanding shares of the company s capital stock from existing stockholders if the directors determine in good faith that the concentration of ownership by such individuals  directly or indirectly  would cause the company to fail to qualify or be disqualified as a reit 
constructive ownership rules are complex and may cause the outstanding stock owned by a group of related individuals or entities to be deemed to be 
table of contents constructively owned by one individual or entity 
as a result  the acquisition of outstanding stock by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity to own constructively a greater concentration of the company s outstanding stock than is acceptable for reit purposes  thereby giving the board the ability to repurchase any excess shares 
because provisions contained in maryland law and capstead s charter may have an anti takeover effect  investors may be prevented from receiving a control premium for their shares 
provisions contained in capstead s charter and maryland general corporation law can delay  defer or prevent a takeover attempt  which may prevent stockholders from receiving a control premium for their shares 
for example  these provisions may defer or prevent tender offers for the company s common stock or purchases of large blocks of the company s common stock  thereby limiting the opportunities for its stockholders to receive a premium over then prevailing market prices 
these provisions include the following repurchase rights granted to capstead s board in its charter limit related investors  including  among other things  any voting group  from owning common stock if the concentration owned would jeopardize the company s reit status 
capstead s charter authorizes the board to issue preferred stock and establish the preferences and rights of any class of preferred stock issued 
these actions can be taken without soliciting stockholder approval and could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of the company 
maryland statutory law provides that an act of a director relating to or affecting an acquisition or a potential acquisition of control of a corporation may not be subject to a higher duty or greater scrutiny than is applied to any other act of a director 
hence  directors of maryland corporations are not required to act in takeover situations under the same standards as apply in delaware and certain other corporate jurisdictions 
capstead may change its policies without stockholder approval 
capstead s board and management determine all of its policies  including its investment  financing and distribution policies and may amend or revise these policies at any time without a vote of the company s stockholders 
policy changes could adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations  the market price of its common stock and preferred stock or the company s ability to pay dividends or distributions 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon capstead s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities including contingencies  revenues and expenses  as well as related disclosures 
these estimates are based on available internal and market information and appropriate valuation methodologies believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the expected useful lives and carrying values of assets and liabilities which can materially affect the determination of net income and book value per common share 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents management believes the following are critical accounting policies in the preparation of capstead s consolidated financial statements that involve the use of estimates requiring considerable judgment amortization of investment premiums on financial assets investment premiums on financial assets are recognized in earnings as adjustments to interest income by the interest method over the estimated lives of the related assets 
for most of capstead s financial assets  estimates and judgments related to future levels of mortgage prepayments are critical to this determination 
mortgage prepayment expectations can vary considerably from period to period based on current and projected changes in interest rates and other factors such as portfolio composition 
management estimates mortgage prepayments based on past experiences with specific investments within the portfolio  and current market expectations for changes in interest rates and the residential mortgage lending environment 
should actual prepayment rates differ materially from these estimates  investment premiums would be expensed at a different pace 
fair value and impairment accounting for financial assets most of capstead s investments are financial assets held in the form of mortgage securities that are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with unrealized gains and losses recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
as such  these unrealized gains and losses enter into the calculation of book value per common share  a key financial metric used by investors in evaluating the company 
fair values fluctuate with current and projected changes in interest rates  prepayment expectations and other factors such as market liquidity conditions 
considerable judgment is required to interpret market data and develop estimated fair values  particularly in circumstances of deteriorating credit quality and market liquidity 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included under item of this report for discussion of how capstead values its financial assets 
generally  gains or losses are recognized in earnings only if sold  however  if a decline in fair value of a mortgage security below its amortized cost occurs that is determined to be other than temporary  the difference between amortized cost and fair value would be recognized in earnings as a component of other revenue expense if the decline was credit related or it was determined to be more likely than not that the company will incur a loss via an asset sale 
other than temporary impairment of a mortgage security due to other factors would be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment 
considerable judgment is also required in determining whether an impairment charge should be recognized on an investment in an unsecuritized loan 
the amount of any such impairment  regardless of whether it arose due to credit issues or other factors  would be recognized in earnings as a component of other revenue expense 
the amount of such charge would be determined by estimating expected future cash flows discounted at market rates 
accounting for derivative financial instruments the company uses derivatives for risk management purposes 
derivatives are recorded as assets or liabilities and carried at fair value and consequently  changes in value of these instruments enter into the calculation of book value per common share 
fair values fluctuate with current and projected changes in interest rates and other factors such as the company s and its counterparties nonperformance risk 
judgment is required to develop estimated fair values 
the accounting for changes in fair value of each derivative held depends on whether it has been designated as an accounting hedge  as well as the type of hedging relationship identified 
to qualify as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes  at the inception of the hedge relationship the company must anticipate and document that the hedge relationship will be highly effective and must monitor ongoing effectiveness on at least a quarterly basis 
as long as the hedge relationship remains effective  the effective portion of changes in fair value of the derivative are recorded in accumulated 
table of contents other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recorded in earnings as a component of interest expense 
changes in fair value of derivatives not held as accounting hedges  or for which the hedge relationship is deemed to no longer be highly effective and as a result hedge accounting is terminated  are recorded in earnings as a component of other revenue expense 
the company currently uses interest rate swap agreements in hedge relationships accounted for as cash flow hedges in order to hedge variability in borrowing rates due to changes in the underlying benchmark interest rate related to a designated portion of its current and anticipated future and day borrowings and the year  floating rate periods of the company s long term unsecured borrowings 
variable rate payments to be received on the swap agreements and any measured hedge ineffectiveness are recorded in interest expense as an offset to interest owed on the hedged borrowings that reset to market rates generally on a monthly basis while fixed rate swap payments to be made are also recorded in interest expense resulting in an effectively fixed borrowing rate on these borrowings  subject to certain adjustments
