in addition  there was an increase of million in allocated overhead and infrastructure costs 
these increases were primarily due to an increase in headcount and growth of the business 
we expect cost of operations expenses to trend down as a percentage of total revenues over the long term as the incremental cost to deploy and support each new customer is expected to decrease due to economies of scale anticipated in our subscription service model infrastructure

income tax expense year ended september  variance dollars income tax expense effective tax rate the effective income tax rate for was compared to for the negative effective tax rate for was primarily the result of nondeductible compensation  revaluation of the contingent consideration  and nondeductible acquisition costs  partially offset by an increase in research and development tax credits  measured against a pretax loss for the year 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
we make estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
we also make estimates and judgments in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we measure and recognize uncertain tax positions 
to recognize such positions we must first determine if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit 
we then must measure the benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
since we are in a net operating loss position for those positions that require a reserve we do not include interest and penalties related to our contingencies in our income tax expense

off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  such estimates and judgments are periodically re evaluated 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
the estimates and judgments noted above are affected by our application of accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies are those we deem most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  including those that require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  income taxes  business combinations  contingent consideration and allowances for accounts receivable 
revenue recognition we generate our revenues from the delivery of subscription services and  to a much lesser degree  consulting services 
we recognize revenues in accordance with accounting standards for software and service companies 
we recognize revenue when evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is considered probable 
if collection is not considered probable  we recognize revenues when the fees are collected 
if the fees are not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenues as payments become due from the customer 
accordingly  our judgment as to the probability of collection and determinability of fees may materially affect the timing of our revenue recognition and results of operations 
if non standard acceptance periods or non standard performance criteria are required  we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the acceptance period or satisfaction of the acceptance performance criteria  as applicable 

table of contents revenues our revenues are typically recognized monthly as the service is provided to the customer and consist of fees paid for subscription services  and amortization of related set up fees 
set up fees paid by customers in connection with subscription services  as well as the associated direct and incremental costs  such as labor and commissions  are deferred until the customer begins service and is recognized ratably over the expected lives of the customer relationships  which generally range from three to five years 
in addition to set up fees  our deferred revenue balances include subscription fees paid in advance of their recognition and software maintenance fees related to our legacy license offerings 
consulting services consist of fees for professional services  which relate to system implementation and integration  planning  data conversion  training  and documentation of procedures 
in determining whether the consulting services can be accounted for separately from subscription revenue  we primarily considers the timing of when the consulting contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date 
consulting services that are sold with the subscription service are recognized ratably over the expected lives of the customer relationships 
consulting services that are sold after the initial contract are typically fixed fee contracts and are recognized as revenue upon delivery 
we also sell consulting services under milestone or fixed fee contracts and  in such cases  recognize consulting revenues as milestones or services are completed 
revenues are adjusted for estimated sales allowances  which are based on our historical experience  including a review of our experience related to price adjustments and sales credits issued 
portions of our revenues are generated from sales made through our reseller partners 
when we assume a majority of the business risks associated with performance of the contractual obligations  we record the revenues on a gross basis and amounts paid to our reseller partners are recognized as sales and marketing expense 
our assumption of such business risks is evidenced when  among other things  we take responsibility for delivery of the product or service  establish pricing of the arrangement and are the primary obligor in the arrangement 
when our reseller partner assumes the majority of the business risks associated with the performance of the contractual obligations  we record the associated revenues net of the amounts paid to our reseller partner 
our judgment as to whether we have assumed the majority of the business risks associated with performance of the contractual obligations materially affects how we report revenues and cost of operations 
income taxes we make estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we measure and recognize uncertain tax positions 
to recognize such positions we must first determine if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit 
we must then measure the benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
since we are in a net operating loss position for those positions that require a reserve we do not include interest and penalties related to our contingencies in our income tax expense 
business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as to in process research and development based upon their estimated fair values 
this valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to long lived and intangible assets 

table of contents critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to estimates about future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists  distribution agreements  proprietary technology and non compete agreements  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio  as well as expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  and discount rates 
our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
other estimates associated with the accounting for these acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
contingent consideration we estimated the fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration using various valuation approaches  as well as significant unobservable inputs  reflecting our assessment of the assumptions market participants would use to value these liabilities 
the fair value of contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period  with any changes in the value recorded as income or expense 
accounts receivable allowances we record provisions for estimated sales allowances against subscription and consulting revenues in the period in which the related revenues are recorded 
we record our sales allowances based on historical experience  including a review of our experience related to price adjustments and sales credits issued 
we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables  and we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts  included in general and administrative expenses 
in estimating allowances for doubtful accounts  we consider specific receivables when collection is doubtful  as well as an analysis of our historical bad debt experience and the current economic environment 
if the data used to estimate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not adequately reflect our future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and future results of operations could be materially affected 
new accounting standards see note of the notes to financial statements for a full description of new accounting pronouncements  including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business 
these risks include primarily interest rate  foreign exchange  market and market interest risks 
interest rate risk 
we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million as of september  short term investments were invested primarily in highly liquid investment vehicles including money market accounts that bear interest at variable overnight or short term rates 
the cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are held for working capital purposes 
our investments are made for capital preservation purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
our cash equivalents and short term investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
fixed rate interest securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in the market value due to changes in interest rates 

table of contents an immediate increase or decrease in market interest rates of basis points at september   could result in a million reduction or increase of the same amount 
this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur 
fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates gains or losses on the carrying value are recorded in other comprehensive income  and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities 
market risk and market interest risk 
in march  we issued at par value million principal amount of our senior convertible notes due in initial notes 
in addition  the underwriters were granted an over allotment option to purchase an additional million principal amount of senior convertible notes due in  which brings the total amount issued under such notes and the initial notes to million collectively  notes 
holders may convert their notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances 
upon conversion  we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amount of the notes 
amounts in excess of the principal amount  if any  will be paid in stock 
concurrent with the issuance of the notes  we entered into separate note hedges transactions and the sale of warrants 
these separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the notes 
our notes have fixed annual interest rates at and therefore  interest expense from these notes is not subject to fluctuation based on changes in market interest rates 
however  the fair value of the notes will fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates
