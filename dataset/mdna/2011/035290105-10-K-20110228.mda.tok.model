table of contents results of operations executive overview the company competes with distributors and manufacturers who sell products directly or through existing distribution channels to end users or other resellers 
the company s relationship with the manufacturers for which it distributes products could be affected by decisions made by these manufacturers as the result of changes in management or ownership as well as other factors 
although relationships with suppliers are good  the loss of a major supplier could have a temporary adverse effect on the company s business  but would not have a lasting impact since comparable products are available from alternate sources 
the company s operating results can be affected by changes in prices of commodities  primarily copper  which are components in some of the products sold 
generally  as the costs of inventory purchases increase due to higher commodity prices  the company s mark up percentage to customers remains relatively constant  resulting in higher sales revenue and gross profit 
in addition  existing inventory purchased at previously lower prices and sold as prices increase may result in a higher gross profit margin 
conversely  a decrease in commodity prices in a short period of time would have the opposite effect  negatively affecting financial results 
the degree to which spot market copper prices change affects product prices and the amount of gross profit earned will be affected by end market demand and overall economic conditions 
importantly  however  there is no exact measure of the effect of changes in copper prices  as there are thousands of transactions in any given quarter  each of which has various factors involved in the individual pricing decisions 
therefore  all references to the effect of copper prices are estimates 
the year on year sales growth of that the company has experienced was fueled by stronger day to day business in both of its cabling businesses along with an increasing number of customer capital projects 
the company s sales performance was also driven by strong year on year organic growth in the oem supply business  which the company believes is indicative of a broad based increase in production levels within virtually all the vertical markets of the company s oem customers 
these growth trends were achieved despite the fact sales in the enterprise cabling and security products business was negatively affected in by million as a result of exiting a major customer contract in late considering the uncertainty that has continued to exist in most major economies  the company believes that customer specific business conditions and outlook are impacting capital spending decisions more than broader macroeconomic factors 
in the current environment  the strength of customer relationships  quality of the company s value proposition and execution of company specific growth initiatives are critical to the company s ability to drive growth 
while the trends over the last three to four quarters have been positive  uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment relative to sovereign debt outside the us and overall high levels of financial leverage continue to weigh on the global recovery and  consequently  there is no guarantee that these positive trends will continue in specifically  the company believes that a more significant improvement will require extended positive trends and an expansion of those macroeconomic trends to more fully include europe

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the company believes that the following are critical areas of accounting that either require significant judgment by management or may be affected by changes in general market conditions outside the control of management 
as a result  changes in estimates and general market conditions could cause actual results to differ materially from future expected results 
historically  the company s estimates in these critical areas have not differed materially from actual results 
allowance for doubtful accounts at december  and january   the company reported net accounts receivable of  million and million  respectively 
each quarter the company segregates the doubtful receivable balances into the following major categories and determines the bad debt reserve required as outlined below customers that are no longer paying their balances are reserved based on the historical write off percentages  risk accounts are individually reviewed and the reserve is based on the probability of potential default 
the company continually monitors payment patterns of customers  investigates past due accounts to assess the likelihood of collection and monitors industry and economic trends to estimate required allowances  and the outstanding balance for customers who have declared bankruptcy is reserved at the outstanding balance less the estimated net realizable value 
if circumstances related to the above factors change  the company s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to the company could be reduced or increased by a material amount 
inventory obsolescence at december  and january   the company reported inventory of  million and million  respectively 
each quarter the company reviews for excess inventories and makes an assessment of the net realizable value 
there are many factors that management considers in determining whether or not or the amount by which a reserve should be established 
these factors include the following return or rotation privileges with vendors  price protection from vendors  expected future usage  whether or not a customer is obligated by contract to purchase the inventory  current market pricing  historical consumption experience  and risk of obsolescence 
if circumstances related to the above factors change  there could be a material impact on the net realizable value of the inventories 
pension expense accounting rules related to pensions and the policies used by the company generally reduce the recognition of actuarial gains and losses in the net benefit cost  as any significant actuarial gains losses are amortized over the remaining service lives of the plan participants 
these actuarial gains and losses are mainly attributable to the return on plan assets that differ from that assumed and differences in the obligation due to changes in the discount rate  plan demographic changes and other assumptions 
a significant element in determining the company s net periodic benefit cost in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles us gaap is the expected return on plan assets 
for  the company had assumed that the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets would be 
this expected return on plan assets is included in the net periodic benefit cost for the fiscal year ended as a result of the combined effect of valuation increases in both the equity and bond markets  the plan assets produced an actual gain of approximately in as compared to a gain of in as a result  the fair value of plan assets increased to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal when the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is significant  the difference is amortized into expense over the service lives of the plan participants 
these amounts are reflected on the balance sheet through charges to other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet 

table of contents the measurement date for all plans of the company is december st 
accordingly  at the end of each fiscal year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to discount the plan liabilities to their present value 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate at the end of and  the company reviewed rates of return on relevant market indices ie  the citigroup pension liability index 
these rates are adjusted to match the duration of the liabilities associated with the pension plans 
at december  and january   the company determined the consolidated weighted average rate of all plans to be and  respectively  and used this rate to measure the projected benefit obligation at the end of each respective fiscal year end 
as a result of the change in the discount rate as well as changes in foreign exchange rates  the projected benefit obligation increased to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal as a result of the change in asset values and the projected benefit obligation  the company s consolidated net pension liability was million at the end of fiscal compared to million at the end of based on the consolidated weighted average discount rate at the beginning of and and  respectively  the company recognized a consolidated pre tax net periodic cost of million in  up from million in the company estimates its net periodic cost to decrease by approximately primarily due to lower interest costs as a result of lower discount rates as well as higher asset levels 
due to its long duration  the pension liability is very sensitive to changes in the discount rate 
as a sensitivity measure  the effect of a basis point decline in the assumed discount rate would result in an increase in the pension expense of approximately million and an increase in the projected benefit obligations at december  of million 
a basis point decline in the assumed rate of return on assets would result in an increase in the expense of approximately million 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets on an annual basis  the company tests for goodwill impairment using a two step process  unless there is a triggering event  in which case a test would be performed at the time that such triggering event occurs 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
for all periods presented  the company s reporting units are consistent with its operating segments of north america  europe  latin america and asia pacific 
the estimates of fair value of a reporting unit are determined based on the income approach  using a discounted cash flow analysis 
a discounted cash flow analysis requires the company to make various judgmental assumptions  including assumptions about future cash flows  growth rates and discount rates 
the assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on management s forecast of each reporting unit 
discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units from the perspective of market participants 
the company also reviews market multiple information to corroborate the fair value conclusions recorded through the aforementioned income approach 
if step one indicates a carrying value above the estimated fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
the company performed its annual impairment analysis during the third quarter of and concluded that no impairment existed 
the company expects the carrying amount of remaining goodwill to be fully recoverable 
in  the company experienced a flat daily sales trend through the first and second quarters 
the resulting effect was that the company did not experience the normal sequential growth pattern from the first to the second quarter 
because of those flat daily sales patterns  on a sequential basis  reported sales were actually down from the first quarter of when the second quarter of sequential drop in reported sales was evaluated against the second quarter of  the result was the largest negative sales comparison experienced since the current economic downturn began 
due to these market and economic conditions  the company concluded that there were impairment indicators for the north america  europe and asia pacific reporting units that required an interim impairment analysis be performed under us gaap during the second fiscal quarter of in the first step of the impairment analysis  the company performed valuation analyses utilizing the income approach to determine the fair value of its reporting units 
the company also considered the market approach as described in us gaap 
under the income approach  the company determined the fair value based on estimated 
table of contents future cash flows discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital  which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 
the inputs used for the income approach were significant unobservable inputs  or level inputs  in the fair value hierarchy described in recently issued accounting guidance on fair value measurements 
estimated future cash flows were based on the company s internal projection models  industry projections and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management as those that would be made by a market participant 
based on the results of the company s assessment in step one  it was determined that the carrying value of the europe reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value while north america and asia pacific s fair value exceeded the carrying value 
therefore  the company performed a second step of the impairment test to estimate the implied fair value of goodwill in europe 
in the second step of the impairment analysis  the company determined the implied fair value of goodwill for the europe reporting unit by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of europe s assets and liabilities  as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the price paid to acquire it was the fair value 
the analysis indicated that there would be an implied value attributable to goodwill of million in the europe reporting unit and accordingly  in the second quarter of  the company recorded a non cash impairment charge related to the write off of the remaining goodwill of million associated with its europe reporting unit 
deferred tax assets the company maintains valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances are included in the company s tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  carryback and carryforward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
assessments are made at each balance sheet date to determine how much of each deferred tax asset is realizable 
these estimates are subject to change in the future  particularly if earnings of a particular subsidiary are significantly higher or lower than expected  or if management takes operational or tax planning actions that could impact the future taxable earnings of a subsidiary 
uncertain tax positions in the normal course of business  the company is audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  and is periodically challenged regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges relate to the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
management believes the company s tax positions comply with applicable tax law and the company intends to defend its positions 
the company recognizes the benefit of tax positions when a benefit is more likely than not ie  greater than likely to be sustained on its technical merits 
recognized tax benefits are measured at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained  based on cumulative probability  in final settlement of the position 
the company s effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if  upon final resolution with taxing authorities  the company prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established  or was required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 
as of december   the aggregate amount of global uncertain tax position liabilities and related interest and penalties recorded was approximately million 
the uncertain tax positions cover a wide range of issues  in particular related to intercompany charges and foreign withholding taxes on such charges as well as on importations  and involve numerous different taxing jurisdictions

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of fluctuations in foreign currencies and interest rate changes  as well as changes in the market value of its financial instruments 
the company periodically enters into derivatives in order to minimize these risks  but not for trading purposes 
the company s strategy is to negotiate terms for its derivatives and other financial instruments to be perfectly effective  such that the change in the value of the derivative perfectly offsets the impact of the underlying hedged item eg  various foreign currency denominated accounts 
the company s counterparties to its derivative contracts have investment grade credit ratings 
the company expects the creditworthiness of its counterparties to remain intact through the term of the transactions 
the company regularly monitors the creditworthiness of its counterparties to ensure no issues exist which could affect the value of the derivatives 
any resulting gains or losses from hedge ineffectiveness are reflected directly in other  net in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
during periods of volatility in foreign exchange rates  the company can be subject to significant foreign exchange gains and losses since there is a time lag between when the company incurs the foreign exchange exposure and when the company has the information to properly hedge the exposure 
foreign exchange risk the company s foreign currency denominated sales were in  in and in the company s exposure to currency rate fluctuations primarily relate to europe euro and british pound and canada canadian dollar 
the company also has exposure to currency rate fluctuations related to more volatile markets such as argentina peso  australia dollar  brazil real  chile peso  colombia peso  mexico peso  and venezuela bolivar 
the company s investments in several subsidiaries are recorded in currencies other than the us dollar 
as these foreign currency denominated investments are translated at the end of each period during consolidation using period end exchange rates  fluctuations of exchange rates between the foreign currency and the us dollar increase or decrease the value of those investments 
these fluctuations and the results of operations for foreign subsidiaries  where the functional currency is not the us dollar  are translated into us dollars using the average exchange rates during the year  while the assets and liabilities are translated using period end exchange rates 
the assets and liabilities related translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity  foreign currency translation  which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  as the company s subsidiaries maintain investments denominated in currencies other than local currencies  exchange rate fluctuations will occur 
borrowings are raised in certain foreign currencies to minimize the exchange rate translation adjustment risk 
several of the company s subsidiaries conduct business in a currency other than the legal entity s functional currency 
transactions may produce receivables or payables that are fixed in terms of the amount of foreign currency that will be received or paid 
a change in exchange rates between the functional currency and the currency in which a transaction is denominated increases or decreases the expected amount of functional currency cash flows upon settlement of the transaction 
that increase or decrease in expected functional currency cash flows is a foreign exchange transaction gain or loss that is included in other  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company purchases foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currency denominated accounts on its reported income 
the foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
the company s strategy is to negotiate terms for its derivatives and other financial instruments to be perfectly effective  such that the change in the value of the derivative perfectly offsets the impact of the underlying hedged item eg  various foreign currency denominated accounts 
the company s counterparties to its foreign currency forward contracts have investment grade credit ratings 
the company expects the creditworthiness of its counterparties to remain intact through the term of the transactions 
the company regularly monitors the creditworthiness of its counterparties to ensure no issues exist which could affect the value of the derivatives 
at december  and january   the notional amount of the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding was approximately million and million  respectively 
the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its foreign currency forward contracts assuming a adverse change in the value of foreign currency contracts outstanding 
the hypothetical adverse changes would have resulted in the company recording a 
table of contents million and million loss in fiscal and  respectively 
however  as these forward contracts are intended to be perfectly effective economic hedges  the company would record offsetting gains as a result of the remeasurement of the underlying foreign currency denominated monetary accounts being hedged 
venezuela foreign exchange the company s functional currency for financial reporting purposes in venezuela is the us dollar usd 
inventory is sourced from vendors in the united states including the parent company of the venezuelan subsidiary  anixter inc and paid for in usd 
sales to customers are invoiced in the local bolivar currency and bolivars are collected from customers to settle outstanding receivables 
during  local government restrictions made it increasingly difficult to transfer cash out of venezuela 
historically  the company utilized the parallel market which involves using bolivars to purchase venezuelan securities and then swap those securities for usd denominated investments to obtain usd to settle usd liabilities 
the use of this parallel market resulted in unfavorable foreign exchange rates as compared with the official rate in venezuela 
in december of  the venezuela operations remitted cash to its us parent using the parallel market  resulting in a million pre tax foreign exchange loss recorded during the fourth quarter of at the end of  as a result of the factors that led to increased usage of the parallel market  including the december cash remittance to the parent  the company re evaluated its historical practice of remeasuring bolivar denominated monetary assets primarily cash and accounts receivable into usd using the official exchange rate for financial reporting purposes 
the company determined that due to the change of circumstances described above  and the expected continued use of the parallel market for repatriating cash from venezuela  use of the parallel rate for remeasurement purposes was most appropriate 
the result of using the unfavorable parallel exchange rate to remeasure these assets was a million pre tax loss recorded during the fourth quarter of in may of  the venezuelan government suspended trading in the parallel market and replaced it with a system called transaction system for foreign currency denominated securities sitme  under the control of the central bank of venezuela 
under the new regulations  the company is limited to converting the venezuelan bolivar to usd at a rate of  per day  up to a maximum of  per month  as permitted by the central bank of venezuela 
the bolivar to usd exchange rate under sitme was adjusted to bolivars to one usd at july  as a result  during the second quarter of  the company recorded a pre tax foreign exchange gain of million due to the remeasurement of venezuela s bolivar denominated monetary assets at the rate determined by the government s newly regulated foreign currency exchange system 
the bolivar to usd exchange rate was bolivars to one usd at the end of the rate at which the company obtains permission to repatriate cash through sitme varies and it is determined by the central bank 
the rate reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements is the average exchange rate obtained during the reporting period for transactions that the company executes through sitme 
the company often receives small approval amounts from the regulatory authority in venezuela at a rate of  however  the company doesn t consider this representative of the rate at which it can repatriate significant cash in a consistent manner 
therefore  the company doesn t use this rate for us gaap accounting 
interest rate risk the company uses interest rate swaps to reduce its exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates 
the objective of the currently outstanding interest rate swaps cash flow hedges is to convert variable interest to fixed interest associated with forecasted interest payments resulting from revolving borrowings in the uk and continental europe and are designated as hedging instruments 
the company does not enter into interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
changes in the value of the interest rate swaps are expected to be highly effective in offsetting the changes attributable to fluctuations in the variable rates 
the company s counterparties to its interest rate swap contracts have investment grade credit ratings 
the company expects the creditworthiness of its counterparties to remain intact through the term of the transactions 
the company regularly monitors the creditworthiness of its counterparties to ensure no issues exist which could affect the value of the derivatives 
when entered into  these financial instruments were designated as hedges of underlying exposures interest payments associated with the uk and continental europe borrowings attributable to changes in the respective benchmark 
table of contents interest rates 
currently  the fair value of the interest rate swaps is determined by means of a mathematical model that calculates the present value of the anticipated cash flows from the transaction using mid market prices and other economic data and assumptions  or by means of pricing indications from one or more other dealers selected at the discretion of the respective banks 
these inputs would be considered level in the fair value hierarchy described in recently issued accounting guidance on fair value measurements 
at december  and january   interest rate swaps were revalued at current interest rates  with the changes in valuation reflected directly in other comprehensive income loss in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the fair market value of the company s outstanding interest rate agreements  which is the estimated exit price that the company would pay to cancel the interest rate agreements  was not significant at december  or january  the company prepared a sensitivity analysis assuming a adverse change in interest rates 
holding all other variables constant  the hypothetical adverse change would have increased interest expense by million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
fair market value of debt instruments the fair value of the company s debt instruments is measured using observable market information which would be considered level in the fair value hierarchy described in recently issued accounting guidance on fair value measurements 
the carrying value of the company s nonconvertible fixed rate debt specifically  notes due and notes due was million and million at december  and january   respectively 
the fair value of the nonconvertible fixed rate debt instruments was million and million at december  and january   respectively 
the decline in the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the company s nonconvertible fixed rate debt is due to the repurchase of a portion of the notes due during fiscal the company s notes due and notes due bear interest at a fixed rate of and  respectively 
therefore  changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on the notes due or the notes due  but interest rates do affect the fair value 
if interest rates were to increase by  the fair market value of the notes due and the notes due would decrease by and at december  and at january   respectively 
if interest rates were to decrease by  the fair market value of the fixed rate debt would increase by and at december  and at january   respectively 
the carrying value of the company s outstanding convertible fixed rate debt specifically  notes due and notes due was million at december  and million at january  as the company s outstanding convertible fixed rate debt may be converted into the company s common stock  the price of the company s common stock may affect the fair value of the company s convertible debt 
the estimated fair value of the company s outstanding convertible debt decreased to million at december  from million at january  the decline in the estimated fair value of the company s convertible debt is primarily due to the repurchase of a portion of the notes due during fiscal a hypothetical increase in the price of the company s common stock from the price at december  and january  would have increased the fair value of its then outstanding convertible debt by million and million  respectively 
changes in the fair market value of the company s debt do not affect the reported results of operations unless the company is retiring such obligations prior to their maturity 
this analysis did not consider the effects of a changed level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment and certain other factors 
further  in the event of a change of this magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to possible changes 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure
