item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k and in our other securities and exchange commission filings 
the following discussion may contain predictions  estimates  and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties  including those discussed under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 
overview we are a medical device company that develops  manufactures  and markets medical devices and implants for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease 
our principal product offerings are sold throughout the world  primarily in the united states  the european union and  to a lesser extent  japan 
we estimate that the annual worldwide market addressed by our core product lines approximates million and that the annual worldwide market for all peripheral vascular devices approximates billion 
we have used acquisitions as a primary means of further accessing the larger peripheral vascular device market  and we expect to continue to pursue this strategy in the future 
we currently manufacture most of our product lines in our burlington  massachusetts  headquarters 
our products are used by vascular surgeons who treat peripheral vascular disease through both open surgical methods and more recently adopted endovascular techniques 
in contrast to interventional cardiologists and interventional radiologists  neither of whom are certified to perform open surgical procedures  vascular surgeons can perform both open surgical and minimally invasive endovascular procedures  and are therefore uniquely positioned to provide patients with a wider range of treatment options 
below is a listing of our principal product lines and product categories our vascular product category includes our balloon catheters  carotid shunts  remote endarterectomy devices  valvulotomes  vascular grafts  and vessel closure systems 
we also report the results of our distribution of the xenosure biologic patch and arterx vascular sealant within this category 
our endovascular product category includes our aortic stent grafts and radiopaque marking tape 
we also report the results of our distribution of the endologix powerlink system within this category 
our general surgery product category consists of our laparoscopic cholecystectomy devices 

table of contents we evaluate the sales performance of our various product lines utilizing criteria that vary based upon the position of each product line in its expected life cycle 
for established products  we typically review unit sales and selling prices 
for newer or faster growing products  we typically also focus upon new account generation and customer retention 
our business opportunities include the following the addition of complementary products through acquisitions  the updating of existing products and introduction of new products through research and development  the long term growth of our sales force in north america  europe and japan  and the introduction of our products in new markets upon obtainment of regulatory approvals in these markets 
we are currently pursuing each of these opportunities 
to assist us in evaluating our business strategies  we regularly monitor long term technology trends in the peripheral vascular device market 
additionally  we consider the information obtained from discussions with the medical community in connection with the demand for our products  including potential new product launches 
we also use this information to help determine our competitive position in the peripheral vascular device market and our manufacturing capacity requirements 
we sell our products primarily through a direct sales force 
as of december  our sales force was comprised of sales representatives in north america  the european union and japan 
we also sell our products in other countries through a network of distributors 
our worldwide headquarters are located in burlington  massachusetts 
our international operations are headquartered in sulzbach  germany 
we also have sales offices located in tokyo  japan  and milan  italy  and a manufacturing facility in laguna hills  california 
in  approximately of our net sales were generated in markets in which we employ direct sales representatives 
in recent years we have experienced comparatively greater success in product markets characterized by low or limited competition  for example the market for remote endarterectomy devices 
in these markets  we believe that we have been able to increase selling prices without sacrificing material market share  to the benefit of our rate of net sales growth 
in contrast  we have experienced comparatively lesser success in highly competitive product markets such as aortic stent grafts  where we face intense competition from larger companies with greater resources 
while this latter trend may moderate as we continue to grow our organization  and while we believe that this trend can be mitigated by our strong relationships with our vascular surgeon customers  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in highly competitive markets 
because we believe that direct to hospital sales engender closer customer relationships  and allow for higher selling prices and gross margins  we periodically enter into transactions with our distributors to transition their sales of our medical devices to our direct sales organization in march  we entered into a definitive agreement with edwards lifesciences to terminate its distribution of our albograft vascular graft 
we paid million to edward lifesciences in exchange for this early termination  the purchase of their albograft customer list  certain customer contracts and remaining albograft inventory  and their provision of sales and marketing services 
in december  we entered into a definitive agreement with cardiva  sl to terminate its distribution of our products in spain effective as of june  the agreement requires us to pay approximately million in exchange for this early termination  the purchase of their spanish customer list for our products  certain customer contracts  and their provision of sales and marketing services 
we are also required to repurchase certain inventory 

table of contents in december  we entered into a definitive agreement with marcom medical aps to terminate its distribution of our products in denmark effective as of june  the agreements require us to pay approximately million in exchange for this early termination  the purchase of their danish customer list for our products  certain customer contracts  and their provision of sales and marketing services 
we are also required to repurchase certain inventory 
we anticipate that the expansion of our direct sales organization to spain  and to a lesser extent  denmark may result in increased sales and marketing expenses during the second half of our strategy for growing our business includes the acquisition of complementary product lines and companies and occasionally the discontinuance or divestiture of products or activities that are no longer complementary in december  we entered into an agreement with neovasc inc to distribute the xenosure biologic vascular patch 
we began selling this product in in march  we discontinued our aspire stent 
in june  we divested our optilock implantible port to minvasive ltd 
for million 
in november  we acquired our lifespan eptfe vascular graft from affiliates of angiotech pharmaceuticals  inc for million and related assets from edwards lifesciences for million 
these activities may affect the comparability of our financial results from period to period and may cause substantial fluctuations from period to period 
in particular  we expect that the lifespan acquisition will increase sales by approximately million but reduce operating income by approximately million in as we integrate this product 
in october  we discontinued research and development activities and suspended clinical studies related to our taarget and unifit aortic stent grafts  and in january we initiated a process to potentially divest these products 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in divesting these products on terms acceptable to us 
we had revenues from these products of approximately million in in october  we announced a reorganization plan designed to eliminate redundant costs resulting from our acquisition of biomateriali srl and to improve efficiencies in our manufacturing operations by transitioning the production of our albograft vascular graft to our corporate headquarters in burlington  massachusetts 
the plan provides for the termination of employees  the relocation of manufacturing equipment  the eventual dissolution of our biomateriali srl subsidiary  and the hiring of approximately employees to staff the required functions in burlington 
in connection with this plan  we incurred approximately million in severance and associated costs to the employees at our brindisi  italy manufacturing facility  of which million was paid in december and the balance will be paid in in addition  we incurred million loan charges  the abandonment of fixed assets and legal fees associated with the negotiation of the severance agreements 
we expect to incur approximately million of additional restructuring charges  of which million will be non cash  related to the closure and transfer of this facility in fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies  primarily the euro  affect our financial results 
for the year ended december   approximately of our sales were from outside the americas 
we expect that foreign currencies will continue to represent a similarly significant percentage of our sales in the future 
selling  marketing  and administrative costs related to these sales are largely denominated in the same respective currency  thereby partially mitigating our transaction risk exposure 
we therefore believe that the risk of a significant impact on our operating income from foreign currency fluctuations is moderated 
however  most of our foreign sales are denominated in local currency  and if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars  it will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase 
in such cases we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect

adjustments to previously issued unaudited preliminary results of operations subsequent to the issuance on february  of our earnings release for the quarter and year ended december   we discovered that  as of the time of the earnings release  we had under accrued restructuring expenses with respect to the closure of our brindisi  italy manufacturing facility by approximately million for the quarter and year ended december   and as a result  our operating expenses for these periods were understated by this amount 
adjusted for the under accrual  for the quarter and year ended december   our operating expenses were million and million  respectively 
the increase in operating expenses caused a an increase in loss from operations from million to million  and a decrease in net income from million to million  or from cents per fully diluted share to cents per fully diluted share  for the quarter ended december   and b a decrease in income from operations from million to million  and a decrease in net income from million to million  or from cents per fully diluted share to cents per fully diluted share  for the year ended december  in addition  on our consolidated balance sheet as at december   total assets increased from million to million  current liabilities increased from million to million  long term liabilities decreased from million to million  total liabilities increased from million to million  and total stockholders equity decreased from million to million 
there were no other revisions to the financial results set forth in the earnings release 
our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included in this annual report on form k reflect these revisions 
net sales and expense components the following is a description of the primary components of our net sales and expenses net sales 
we derive our net sales from the sale of our products  less discounts and returns 
most of our sales are generated by our direct sales force and are shipped and billed to hospitals or clinics throughout the world 
in countries where we do not have a direct sales force  sales are primarily generated by shipments to distributors who  in turn  sell to hospitals and clinics 
in those cases where our products are held on consignment at a hospital or clinic  we generate sales at the time the product is used in surgery rather than at shipment 

table of contents cost of sales 
we manufacture nearly all of the products that we sell 
our cost of sales consists primarily of manufacturing personnel  raw materials and components  depreciation of property and equipment  and other allocated manufacturing overhead  as well as freight expense we pay to ship products to customers 
sales and marketing 
our selling and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries  commissions  stock based compensation  travel and entertainment  attendance at medical society meetings  training programs  advertising and product promotions  direct mail  and other marketing costs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of executive  finance and human resource expense  stock based compensation  legal and accounting fees  information technology expense  intangible amortization expense  and insurance expense 
research and development 
research and development expense includes costs associated with the design  development  testing  enhancement  and regulatory approval of our products 
it also includes costs associated with design and execution of clinical studies  regulatory submissions and costs to register  maintain  and defend our intellectual property  and royalty payments associated with licensed and acquired intellectual property 
restructuring 
restructuring expense includes costs directly associated with distribution agreement termination expenses  severance  and retention costs for terminated employees  and other expenses associated with restructuring our operations 
other income expense 
other income expense primarily includes interest income and expense  investment impairment charges  foreign currency gains losses  and other miscellaneous gains losses 
income tax expense 
we are subject to federal and state income taxes for earnings generated in the united states  which include operating losses in certain foreign jurisdictions for certain years depending on tax elections made  and foreign taxes on earnings of our wholly owned german  french  italian  and japanese subsidiaries 
our consolidated tax expense is affected by the mix of our taxable income loss in the united states  germany  france  italy  and japan  permanent items  discrete items  unrecognized tax benefits  and amortization of goodwill for u

table of contents net sales 
net sales increased to million in from million in sales in our vascular product category grew  while sales in our endovascular product category decreased by and general surgery increased by from the previous year 
foreign currency exchange rates subtracted from year over year sales growth 
sales increases in were largely driven by higher average selling prices across nearly all product lines  as well as stronger sales of our vascular products which included increased sales of valvulotomes of million  biologic patches of million  and carotid shunts of million 
these gains were partially offset by a million decrease in our endovascular product category  primarily due to decreased taarget and unifit stent graft sales of million 
sales were unfavorably impacted by the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations by million 
taarget and unifit stent graft sales declined by in compared to the prior year 
the results were due mainly to the retirement of our largest stent graft customer in the fourth quarter of  a reduction in sales to a distributor in greece  and strong competitor product offerings 
we suspended our clinical trials and ceased development efforts related to these products in november we expect that our taarget and unifit sales will continue to decline in as we divert corporate resources to other product lines 
in november  we acquired the lifespan eptfe vascular graft 
net sales of this product were million in december  primarily in europe 
direct to hospital net sales were in  up from in the increase was primarily due to the conversion of our albograft vascular graft from a distribution model to a direct sales model in march  resulting in an additional three months of direct sales in net sales by geography 
net sales in the americas increased million to million in the increase was mainly the result of higher average selling prices  increased biologic patch sales of million  and strong results across nearly all of our vascular product offerings 
international net sales of million were flat in international sales were favorably impacted by a million increase in vascular products sales  led by vascular graft and valvulotome sales  as well as a million increase in powerlink system sales 
international sales were unfavorably impacted by the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations of million and a million decrease in sales of our own aortic stent grafts and a million decrease in sales to the one private label customer of our biomateriali subsidiary 
we have terminated our relationship with this customer  who purchased million of dacron related products in  and do not expect this revenue to recur in international direct to hospital net sales were in  up from in the increase was primarily due to our direct sales of the albograft vascular graft for twelve months in as opposed to nine months in change percent change in thousands gross profit gross margin not applicable gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in from million in  while our gross margin increased to 
the gross margin increase was largely the result of improved manufacturing efficiencies in our burlington facility  higher average selling prices across nearly all product lines  particularly in the united states  and favorable geographic sales mix versus the prior year 
the gross margin increase was partially offset by an increase in excess and obsolete inventory write downs of million  manufacturing start up costs associated with the transfer of albograft vascular graft manufacturing to our burlington  massachusetts headquarters  and sales growth in our comparatively lower margin polyester grafts and distributed products 
we expect albograft manufacturing start up costs and biomateriali plant closure costs to continue to adversely affect the gross margin in

sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense increased to million in  from million in selling expenses increased million to million while marketing expenses remained relatively flat 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales and marketing expense by million compared to the prior year 
selling expense increases were largely driven by higher commission costs of million and higher base compensation costs of million  partly due to additional sales representatives 
as a percentage of net sales  sales and marketing expenses were in  comparable to the prior year 
at the end of  we employed sales representatives worldwide  as compared to at the end of we plan to continue to increase the size of our sales force in  and we expect that related cost increases may be partially offset by reduced commission expenses primarily from the reduction of periodic sales contests 
in addition  we intend to commence direct sales in spain and denmark in we expect to incur additional selling and marketing expenses as we hire sales personnel in those countries 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense increased to million in from million in the increase was largely the result of higher personnel costs of million  and was partially offset by a decrease in professional services of million and changes in foreign currency exchange rates of million 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses were in both and research and development 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  research and development expense decreased to in from in the decrease was driven primarily by a reduction of regulatory and clinical affairs costs of million to million in  largely due to reduced animal testing as well as a reduction in the use of outside services following the suspension of enrollment of our unite and enrust trials in october expenses related to product development and royalties remained consistent between and we expect clinical and regulatory expenses will continue to decline as expenses associated with our clinical trials abate  however  we plan to reallocate a portion of these savings to additional product development in restructuring 
restructuring charges were million in and in  we incurred a million restructuring charge related to the closure of our biomateriali manufacturing facility in brindisi  italy  and the related transition of production to our existing corporate headquarters in burlington  massachusetts 
the restructuring charge consisted of million of employee related severance charges  million of charges associated with repayment of a development grant and loan from the italian government  and million of charges related to the abandonment of fixed assets and legal fees 
we expect to incur approximately million of additional restructuring charges related to the closure and transfer of this facility in in addition  we expect to incur restructuring charges associated with the termination of our spanish distributor 
in  we incurred a million restructuring charge related to the march  termination of our albograft vascular graft distribution agreement with edwards lifesciences 
the transaction included the payment of million in exchange for the termination of the distribution agreement  as well as the acquisition of detailed customer information  transition services  and remaining product inventory 

table of contents impairment charges 
we incurred million of impairment charges in of which million was due to the write down of certain technology  customer lists  and fixed assets related to our aortic stent graft product line 
as of december   we determined that impairment indicators existed as a result of our decision to suspend enrollment into our unite and entrust clinical trials and cease product development efforts in october the residual fair value of the taarget and unifit intangible assets was million as of december  additionally  we incurred a million impairment charge associated with a biomateriali private label customer relationship  which we subsequently terminated 
we incurred million of impairment charges in related to patents deemed to have no value based on future expected economic benefits 
other income expense 
foreign exchange losses for were  compared to foreign exchange gains of million in foreign exchange gains were due to the comparative strengthening of the dollar versus the euro during the year 
net interest income and other income expense was relatively flat between and income tax expense 
we recorded a tax benefit of million in compared to a tax expense of million in  on pre tax income of million in and million in the benefit was primarily due to the release of our us deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million  and was partially offset by us deferred provision of million  taxes in certain foreign subsidiaries that are profitable of million  federal tax in the united states of million  and state taxes of million 
the valuation allowance reversal was the result of achieving three year cumulative profitability which occurred in the fourth quarter of as well as our expectation of future taxable income in the us the provision was comprised of taxes on profits on certain of our foreign subsidiaries that are profitable  deferred tax liabilities related to the amortization of goodwill for us tax purposes which could not be used to reduce existing deferred tax assets  and the alternative minimum tax 
our effective tax rate differed from the us statutory tax rate in principally due to the reversal of the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets and utilization of u 
s net operating loss carryforwards 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of the resolution of any particular tax matter  we believe that our tax reserves reflect the probable outcome of known contingencies 
we have assessed the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and concluded that as of december   we have emerged from a cumulative loss position in the fourth quarter of in the united states 
as previously noted  we have reversed million of valuation allowance against certain us deferred tax assets as based on the weight of available evidence we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized 
we continue to carry a valuation allowance against million of other deferred tax assets  principally foreign net operating loss carryforwards  which based on the weight of available evidence  we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
we expect that our effective tax rate will increase in and begin to approach the us statutory tax rate as we fully utilized all of our u 
s net operating loss carryforwards in and we expect to utilize our remaining research and development credit carryforwards in

these gains were partially offset by a million decrease in our endovascular product category  primarily due to reduced sales of our taarget stent graft and the powerlink system  as well as the effect of negative currency exchange rate fluctuations of million

impairment charges 
we incurred million of impairment charges in related to patents deemed to have no value based on future expected economic benefits

we did not hold any marketable securities nor any mortgage asset backed or auction rate securities in our investment portfolio as of december  in the event of a temporary decline in market value  we have the intent and ability to hold our investments for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of the principal amounts invested 
we continually monitor the asset allocation of our holdings in an attempt to mitigate our credit and interest rate exposures  and we intend to continue to closely monitor developments in the credit markets and make appropriate changes to our investment policy as necessary 
operating and capital expenditure requirements we require cash to pay our operating expenses  make capital expenditures  fund acquisitions  and pay our long term liabilities 
since our inception  we have funded our operations through private and public placements of equity securities  short term borrowings  and funds generated from our operations 
for the year ended december   we recognized operating income of million 
for the year ended december   we recognized operating income of million 
although it is our intention to generate an 
table of contents operating profit on an ongoing basis  excluding the impact of acquisitions  divestitures and distributor terminations  there can be no assurance that we will generate an operating profit in the future due to our continued investment in growing our business 
we expect to fund any increased costs and expenditures from our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  though our future capital requirements depend on numerous factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following the revenues generated by sales of our products  the ongoing transfer of our albograft vascular graft manufacturing from brindisi  italy to burlington  massachusetts  the termination of distributor agreements in spain and denmark and subsequent start up costs associated with going direct in those markets  payments associated with potential future quarterly cash dividends to our common stockholders  payments associated with our stock repurchase plan  the costs associated with expanding our manufacturing  marketing  sales  and distribution efforts  the rate of progress and cost of our research and development activities  the costs of obtaining and maintaining fda and other regulatory clearances of our existing and future products  the effects of competing technological and market developments  remaining payment obligations associated with the lifespan vascular graft acquisition  and the number  timing  and nature of acquisitions and other strategic transactions our cash balances may decrease as we continue to use cash to fund our operations  make acquisitions  make purchases under our share repurchase program  make payments under our quarterly dividend program  and make deferred payments related to prior acquisitions 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents  investments and the interest we earn on these balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
if these sources of cash are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements beyond the next twelve months  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or borrow from a financial institution 
the sale of additional equity and debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities  such securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
we may require additional capital beyond our currently forecasted amounts 
any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
credit facility we currently have no credit facility 
we terminated our revolving line of credit with brown brothers harriman co 
effective as of august  our borrowing capacity under this facility was million and the maximum principal amount of any letters of credit issued as part of this facility was million 
loans made under this revolving line of credit bore interest at the bank s base rate or libor plus basis points  at our discretion  and were collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
the loan agreement required that we meet certain financial and operating covenants including a required leverage ratio and minimum tangible net worth 
as of august  and december   we had no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility and were in compliance with these covenants 
as part of the purchase of biomateriali srl  we assumed a loan from the italian government under a program that provides funding to certain businesses in italy through a combination of grants and loans if certain requirements are met 
the loan was stated to be payable in ten annual payments through of principal and 
table of contents interest at an interest rate of 
the present value of the loan was recorded as of the date the proceeds were received using our incremental borrowing rate 
interest was being imputed on the loan and the amortization was recorded as interest expense 
in march  the italian government informed us that the loan and grants will become due in full as a result of the biomateriali srl plant closure 
we expect to repay the previous grants received  the imputed interest on the outstanding loan balance  and certain additional interest and penalties of approximately million  which has been recorded as restructuring expense for the year ended december  the outstanding amount of the accelerated loan and grant repayment was approximately million as of december  and has been recorded in our balance sheet in accrued expenses

dividends 
on february   our board of directors approved a policy for the payment of regular quarterly cash dividends on our common stock of per share 
the first quarterly dividend is payable on april   to stockholders of record at the close of business on march   and will be approximately million 
future declarations of quarterly dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to approval by our board of directors on a quarterly basis 
contractual obligations 
our principal contractual obligations consist of operating leases  inventory purchase commitments  and income tax obligations for unrecognized tax benefits 
the following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations total less than year years years in thousands operating leases purchase commitments for inventory payments to terminate foreign distributors acquisition related liabilities unrecognized tax benefits total contractual obligations the commitments under our operating leases consist primarily of lease payments for our burlington  massachusetts  corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility  expiring in  our sulzbach  germany office  expiring in  our tokyo  japan office  expiring in  and our milan  italy office  expiring in the purchase commitments for inventory are to be used in operations over the normal course of business and do not represent excess commitments or loss contracts 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
our most significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates and assumptions  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  sales returns and discounts  and income taxes are reviewed on an ongoing basis and updated as appropriate 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
certain of our more critical accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  and observance of trends in the industry  as appropriate 
different  reasonable estimates could have been used in the current period 
additionally  changes in accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
both of these factors could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition  or results of operations 

table of contents we believe that the following financial estimates and related accounting policies are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require subjective or complex judgments 
further  we believe that the items discussed below are properly recorded in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of our most critical financial estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and our independent registered public accounting firm 
the judgments about those financial estimates are based on information available as of the date of our consolidated financial statements 
those financial estimates and related policies include revenue recognition our revenue is derived primarily from the sale of disposable or implantable devices used during vascular surgery 
we sell directly to hospitals and to distributors  as described below  and  during the periods presented in our consolidated financial statements  entered into consigned inventory arrangements with either hospitals or distributors on a limited basis 
we recognize revenue when four basic criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we generally use customer purchase orders or contracts to determine the existence of an arrangement 
substantially all sales transactions are based on prices that are determinable at the time that the customer s purchase order is accepted by us 
in order to determine whether collection is reasonably assured  we assess a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we would defer the recognition of revenue until collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
we provide for product returns at the time revenue is recognized based on our historical return product history 
based on these policies  we recognize revenue  net of allowances for returns and discounts  as products are shipped  based on shipping point terms  or at the time consigned inventory is consumed at which time title passes to customers 
we recognize revenue net of allowances for returns and discounts  at the time of shipment of our products to our distributors 
accounts receivable our accounts receivable are with customers based in the united states and internationally 
accounts receivable generally are due within to days of invoice and are stated at amounts due from customers  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  other than in certain european markets where longer payment terms are customary 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the current creditworthiness of the customers  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor aging reports  collections  and payments from customers  and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues we identify 
we write off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and allowances  we cannot guarantee the same credit loss rates will be experienced in the future 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts on a monthly basis and all past due balances are reviewed individually for collectability 
the provision for doubtful accounts is recorded in general and administrative expenses 
inventory inventory consists of finished products  work in process  and raw materials 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market value 
cost includes materials  labor  and manufacturing overhead and is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
on a quarterly basis  we review inventory quantities on hand and analyze the 
table of contents provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on product expiration dating and our estimated sales forecast  which is based on sales history and anticipated future demand 
our estimates of future product demand may not be accurate  and we may understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
accordingly  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and results of operations 
stock based compensation we recognize  as expense  the estimated fair value of stock options to employees which is determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
we have elected to recognize the compensation cost of all share based awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award 
in periods that we grant stock options  fair value assumptions are based on volatility  interest  dividend yield  and expected term over which the stock options will be outstanding 
the computation of expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the company s stock 
the interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the us treasury risk free interest rate in effect at the time of grant 
the expected lives of the options were estimated using the simplified method for plain vanilla options 
computation of expected forfeitures is based on historical forfeiture rates of our share based awards 
we also issue restricted stock units rsus as an additional form of equity compensation to our employees  officers  and directors  pursuant to our stockholder approved plan 
rsus entitle the grantee to an issuance of stock at no cost and generally vest over a period of time determined by our board of directors at the time of grant based upon the continued service to the company 
the fair market value of the award is determined based on the number of rsus granted and the market value of our common stock on the grant date and is amortized to expense over the period of vesting 
computation of expected forfeitures is based on historical forfeiture rates of our share based awards 
unvested rsus are forfeited and canceled as of the date that employment or service to the company terminates 
rsus are settled in shares of our common stock upon vesting 
we may repurchase common stock upon our employees vesting in rsus in order to cover any minimum tax withholding liability as a result of the rsus having vested 
we used an expected forfeiture rate of approximately   and for   and  respectively 
share based compensation charges are recorded net of the estimated forfeitures and will be adjusted in future periods to reflect the results of actual forfeitures and vesting 
share based compensation charges are recorded across the consolidated statement of operations based upon the grantee s primary function 
as disclosed more fully in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  we recorded expense of approximately million in connection with share based payment awards for the year ended december  the future expense of non vested share based awards of approximately million is to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
during  we granted stock options at a weighted average exercise price of and restricted stock units with fair value weighted average price of 
valuation of goodwill  other intangibles when we acquire a business  the purchase price is allocated  as applicable  among acquired tangible net assets  identifiable intangible assets  and goodwill as required by gaap 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets of the acquired businesses 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists 
we evaluate the december balance of the carrying value of goodwill based on a single reporting unit 
the first step of our goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  the goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  and thus the second step of the impairment test  used to measure the amount of the impairment loss  is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed 
table of contents to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill as of the date of the impairment review with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of our goodwill is determined on the same basis as the amount of goodwill recognized in connection with a business combination 
specifically  we allocate the fair value of our reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination as of the date of the impairment review and as if the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we have determined that no impairment charges were required during the year ended december  as our market capitalization as a whole has exceeded the carrying amount  and on that basis we concluded that goodwill was not impaired 
goodwill was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
our annual impairment testing indicated no significant risk of impairment based upon changes in value that are reasonably likely to occur 
however  changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of our reporting unit 
other intangible assets consist primarily of purchased developed technology  patents  customer relationships  and trademarks and are amortized over their estimated useful lives  ranging from to years 
we review intangible assets quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist for a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment 
conditions that may indicate impairment include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of the asset  a change in the operating cash flows associated with the asset  or adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
if an impairment indicator exists we test the intangible asset for recoverability 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the intangible asset  we will write the carrying value down to the fair value in the period identified 
we generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk adjusted discount rate 
in determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets  we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions  cost structures  and remaining useful lives of the asset 
these estimates and assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts 
other intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  were million as of december   and million as of december  we recognized impairment charges on our intangible assets of million in and million in contingencies in the normal course of business  we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits  and other claims and assessments for matters related to  among other things  patent infringement  business acquisitions  employment  and product recalls 
we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
we record charges for the costs we anticipate incurring in connection with litigation and claims against us when we determine a loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate these costs 
during the years ended december    and  we were not subject to any material litigation  claims or assessments 
restructuring we record restructuring charges incurred in connection with consolidation or relocation of operations  exited business lines  or distributor terminations 
these restructuring charges  which reflect our commitment to a termination or exit plan that will begin within twelve months  are based on estimates of the expected costs associated with site closure  legal matters  contract terminations  or other costs directly related to the restructuring 

table of contents if the actual cost incurred exceeds the estimated cost  an additional charge to earnings will result 
if the actual cost is less than the estimated cost  a credit to earnings will be recognized 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to determine our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from taxable income during the carryback period or in the future  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must reflect this increase as an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
we do not provide for income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries  as our current intention is to permanently reinvest these earnings 
we recognize  measure  present and disclose in our financial statements  uncertain tax positions that we have taken or expect to take on a tax return 
we operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions  both within the united states and outside of the united states and may be subject to audits from various tax authorities regarding transfer pricing  the deductibility of certain expenses  intercompany transactions  and other matters 
within specific countries  we may be subject to audit by various tax authorities operating within the country and may be subject to different statutes of limitation expiration dates 
management s judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  liabilities for uncertain tax positions  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we will continue to monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly 
we have recorded a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
marketable securities our investments consist primarily of marketable debt securities and us government securities  and are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair market value at december  the unrealized gains losses on available for sale securities are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we consider all highly liquid investments with maturities of days or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents  and investments with maturities of greater than days at the time of purchase to be short term investments 
when a marketable security incurs a significant unrealized loss for a sustained period of time  we review the instrument to determine if it is other than temporarily impaired 
if we conclude an instrument is other than temporarily impaired  we record the unrealized loss in the consolidated statement of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  we do not currently have  nor have we ever had  any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market  or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued new guidance to determine whether variable interests in third party entities grant a controlling financial interest in the entities 
this amended 
table of contents guidance replaces the previous quantitative approach for identifying when enterprises should consolidate variable interest entities with a qualitative analysis  based on which enterprise has both the power to direct the economic activities of a variable interest entity and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity that could be significant to the variable interest entity 
we adopted this guidance effective january  the adoption did not have an effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk this item is not applicable to us as a smaller reporting company
