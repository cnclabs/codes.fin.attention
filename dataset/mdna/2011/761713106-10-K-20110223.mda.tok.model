rjr tobacco rjr tobacco primarily conducts business in the highly competitive us cigarette market  which has a few large manufacturers and many smaller participants 
the us cigarette market is a mature market in which overall consumer demand has declined since and is expected to continue to decline 
profitability of the us cigarette industry and rjr tobacco continues to be adversely impacted by decreases in consumption  increases in state

camel dissolvables include camel orbs  sticks and strips  all of which are made of finely milled tobacco and dissolve completely in the mouth 
rjr tobacco s brand portfolio strategy is based upon three brand categories growth  support and non support 
the growth brands consist of a premium brand  camel  and a value brand  pall mall 
although both of these brands are managed for long term market share and profit growth  camel will continue to receive the most significant investment support 
the support brands include four premium brands  winston  kool  salem and capri  and two value brands  doral and misty  all of which receive limited marketing support 
the non support brands  consisting of all other brands  are managed to maximize near term profitability 
the key objectives of the portfolio strategy are designed to focus on the long term market share growth of the growth brands while managing the support brands for long term sustainability and profitability 
consistent with that strategy  rjr tobacco has discontinued many of its non core cigarette styles as well as private label cigarette brands 
rjr tobacco s modern smoke free products are marketed under the camel brand and focus on long term growth 
competition is based primarily on brand positioning  including price  product attributes and packaging  consumer loyalty  promotions  advertising and retail presence

in contrast to the declining us cigarette market  us moist snuff volumes grew over in profit margins on moist snuff products are generally higher than on cigarette products 
moist snuff s growth is partially attributable to cigarette smokers switching from cigarettes to smokeless tobacco products or using both 
the growth in moist snuff volumes in is higher than prior years due to competitive promotional strategies during and a change in competitive shipments reporting  which excludes product returns 
american snuff faces significant competition in the smokeless tobacco categories
