we primarily focus on recruiting and educating working adults  whom we define as students age or older who are pursuing a degree while employed 
as of december   approximately of our online students were age or older 
we believe that working adults are attracted to the convenience and flexibility of our online programs because they can study and interact with faculty and classmates during times that suit their schedules 
we also believe that working adults represent an attractive student population because they are better able to finance their education  more readily recognize the benefits of a postsecondary degree  and have higher persistence and completion rates than students generally 
we have experienced significant growth in enrollment  net revenue  and operating income over the last several years 
our enrollment at december  was approximately  representing an increase of approximately over our enrollment at december  our net revenue and operating income for the year ended december  were million and million  respectively  representing increases of and  respectively  over the year ended december  our net revenue and operating income for the year ended december  were million and million  respectively  representing increases of and  respectively  over the year ended december  we seek to achieve continued growth in a manner that reinforces our reputation for providing academically rigorous  career oriented educational programs that advance the careers of our students

in addition  we have specialized accreditations for certain programs from the association of collegiate business schools and programs  the commission on collegiate nursing education  and the commission on accreditation of athletic training education 
we believe that our institution wide state authorization and regional accreditation  together with these specialized accreditations  reflect the quality of our programs  enhance their marketability  and improve the employability of our graduates 
we believe that our online capabilities  combined with our year heritage as a traditional campus based university  differentiate us in the for profit postsecondary market and enhance the reputation of our degree programs among students and employers 
our online students benefit from our flexible  interactive online platform  which we believe offers a highly effective delivery medium for our programs  yet are enrolled in a university with a traditional campus  faculty  facilities  and athletic programs 
we require our online faculty to undergo training in the delivery of online programs before teaching their initial course  while our full time ground faculty and select online faculty help maintain the consistency and quality of our online programs by supervising and conducting peer reviews of our online faculty  and participating as subject matter experts in the development of our online curricula 
our campus also offers our ground students  faculty and staff an opportunity to participate in a traditional college experience 

table of contents history grand canyon college was founded in prescott  arizona in as a traditional  private  non profit college and moved to its existing campus in phoenix  arizona in established as a baptist affiliated institution with a strong emphasis on religious studies  the school initially focused on offering bachelor s degree programs in education 
over the years  the school expanded its curricula to include programs in the sciences  nursing  business  music  and arts 
the college obtained regional accreditation in from the commission on institutions of higher education  north central association of colleges and schools  the predecessor to the higher learning commission  and began offering nursing programs and master s degree programs in education and business in the s 
in  it achieved university status and became grand canyon university 
the university introduced its first distance learning programs in  and launched its first online programs in in business and education 
in early  it discontinued its baptist affiliation and became a non denominational christian university 
in late  the school s board of trustees initiated a process to evaluate alternatives as a result of the school s poor financial condition and  in february  several of our current stockholders acquired the assets of the school and converted its operations to a for profit institution 
since february  we have enhanced our senior management team  expanded our online platform and programs  initiated an infrastructure and technology improvement plan and launched a marketing and branding effort to further differentiate us in the markets in which we operate and support our continued growth 
we have also made investments to enhance our student and technology support services and added additional infrastructure including an additional dormitory and classroom building  a recreation center and an arena to support our growing traditional on campus student population 
we believe these investments  combined with our management expertise  provide a platform that will support continued enrollment and revenue growth 
we have also maintained our non denominational christian identity  with many of our undergraduate programs including christian study requirements 
our approach to academic quality some of the key elements that we focus on to promote a high level of academic quality include academically rigorous  career oriented curricula 
we create academically rigorous curricula that are designed to enable all students to gain the foundational knowledge  professional competencies  and demonstrable skills required to be successful in their chosen fields 
our curriculum is designed and delivered by faculty that are committed to delivering a high quality  rigorous education 
we design our curricula to address specific career oriented objectives that we believe working adult students in the disciplines we serve are seeking 
through this combination  we believe that we produce graduates that can compete and become leaders in their chosen fields 
qualified faculty 
we demonstrate our commitment to high quality education by hiring qualified faculty with relevant practical experience 
substantially all of our current faculty members hold at least a master s degree in their respective field and of our faculty members hold a doctoral degree 
faculty members are able to integrate relevant  practical experiences from their professional careers into the courses they teach 
we invest in the professional development of our faculty members by providing training in traditional and online teaching techniques  hosting events and discussion forums that foster sharing of best practices  and continually assessing teaching effectiveness through assessment  peer reviews  and student evaluations 
standardized course design 
we employ a standardized curriculum development process to ensure a consistent learning experience with frequent faculty student interaction in our courses 
we thereafter continuously review our programs in an effort to ensure that they remain consistent  up to date  and effective in producing the desired learning outcomes 
we also regularly review student surveys to identify opportunities for course modifications and upgrades 

table of contents effective student services 
we establish teams comprised of enrollment  academic and finance personnel that act as the primary support contact point for each of our students  beginning at the application stage and continuing through graduation 
in recent years  we have also concentrated on improving the technology used to support student learning  including enhancing our online learning platform and further improving student services through the implementation of online interfaces 
as a result  many of our support services  including academic  administrative  library  and career services  are accessible online  generally allowing users to access these services at a time and in a manner that is generally convenient to them 
continual academic oversight 
we have centralized the assessment functions for all of our programs through our office of assessment  which continuously evaluates the desired learning outcomes for each of our programs 
we continuously assess outcomes data to determine whether our students graduate with the knowledge  competencies  and skills that are necessary to succeed in the workplace 
the office of assessment also initiates and manages periodic examinations of our curricula by internal and external reviewers to evaluate and verify program quality and workplace applicability 
based on these processes and student feedback  we determine whether to modify or discontinue programs that do not meet our standards or market needs  or to create new programs 
the office of assessment also oversees assessment of mission based competencies 
we also offer the following features in an effort to enrich the academic experience of current and prospective students flexibility in program delivery 
we also seek to meet market demands by providing students with the flexibility to take courses exclusively online or to combine online coursework with various campus and onsite options 
for example  based on market demand  particularly in connection with our nursing programs  we have established satellite locations at multiple hospitals that allow nursing students to take clinical courses onsite while completing other course work online 
we have established similar onsite arrangements with other major employers  including schools and school districts through which students can pursue student teaching opportunities 
this flexibility raises our profile among employers  encourages students to take and complete courses and eliminates inconveniences that tend to lessen student persistence 
small class size 
at december   over of our online classes had or fewer students 
these class sizes provide each student with the opportunity to interact directly with course faculty and to receive individualized feedback and attention while also affording our faculty with the opportunity to engage proactively with a manageable number of students 
we believe this interaction enhances the academic quality of our programs by promoting opportunities for students to participate actively and thus build the requisite knowledge  competencies  and skills 

table of contents accreditation and program approvals we believe that the quality of our academic programs is evidenced by the college and program specific accreditations and approvals that we have pursued and obtained

for example  for our nursing programs  we offer clinical courses onsite at hospitals and other healthcare centers with which we have relationships  and also arrange to allow these students to complete their clinical work onsite 
we refer to students attending a program with us through such relationships as professional studies students 
we currently offer our ground based programs to traditional students through three week semesters in a calendar year and to online students in five  seven or eight week courses throughout the calendar year 
traditional students generally enroll in three or four courses per semester while online students typically concentrate on one course at a time 
while there is no explicit requirement  we communicate to our online students our expectation that they access their online student classroom at least four times each week in order to maintain an active dialogue with their professors and classmates 
our online programs provide a digital record of student interactions for the course instructor to assess students levels of engagement and demonstration of required competencies 

table of contents new program development we typically identify a potential new degree program or emphasis area through market demand or from proposals developed by faculty  staff  students  alumni  or partners  and then perform an analysis of the development cost and the long term demand for the program 
if  following this analysis  we decide to proceed with the program  our curriculum design and development team designates a subject matter expert who works with other faculty and our curriculum development personnel to design a program that is consistent with our academically rigorous  career oriented program standards 
the program is then reviewed by the dean of the applicable college  the program standards and evaluation committee  academic affairs committee  our provost and chief academic officer  and finally  our president 
upon approval  the subject matter expert develops a course syllabus and our marketing department creates a marketing plan to publicize the new program 
our average program development process is six months from proposal to course introduction 
the development process is typically longer if we are expanding into a new field or offering a new level of degree 
assessment our office of assessment serves as our central resource for assessing and continually improving our curricula  student satisfaction and learning outcomes 
among other things  the assessment team reviews student course satisfaction surveys  analyzes archived student assignments to assess whether a given program is developing students foundational knowledge  professional competencies  and skills to achieve the expected learning outcomes  and provides feedback as to program effectiveness 
based on this data and the conclusions of the assessment team  we modify programs as necessary to meet our student satisfaction and educational development standards and make recommendations as to adding or modifying programs 
faculty our faculty includes full time faculty who teach under a nine month or twelve month teaching contract  as well as adjunct faculty whom we employ to teach on a course by course basis for a specified fee 
as of december   we employed full time faculty members and we maintain a pool of over  adjunct faculty members  all of whom had completed our required training 
substantially all of our current faculty members hold at least a master s degree in their respective field and of our faculty members hold a doctoral degree 
on occasion  we engage a limited number of faculty members who may not hold a graduate degree  but who evidence significant professional experience and achievement in their respective subject areas 
we believe that the quality of our faculty is critical to our success  particularly because faculty members have more interaction with our students than any other university employee 
accordingly  we regularly review the performance of our faculty  including  but not limited to  engaging our full time faculty and other specialists to conduct peer reviews of our adjunct faculty  monitoring the amount of contact and the quality of feedback that faculty have with students in our online programs  reviewing student feedback  and evaluating the learning outcomes achieved by students 
if we determine that a faculty member is not performing at the level that we require  we work with the faculty member to improve performance  including  among other things  assigning him or her a mentor or through other means 
if the faculty member s performance does not improve  we terminate the faculty member s contract and employment 
student support services encouraging students that enter grand canyon university to complete their degree programs is critical to the success of our business 
we focus on developing and providing resources that support the student educational experience  simplify the student enrollment process  acclimate students to our programs and our online environment  and track student performance toward degree completion

marketing  recruitment  and retention marketing 
we engage in a range of marketing activities designed to position us as a provider of academically rigorous  career oriented educational programs  build strong brand recognition in our core disciplines  differentiate us from other educational providers  raise awareness among prospective students  generate enrollment inquiries  and stimulate student and alumni referrals 
we target our online programs to working adults focused on program quality  convenience  and career advancement goals 
we target our ground programs to traditional college students  working adults seeking a high quality education in a traditional college setting  and working adults seeking to take classes with a cohort onsite at their employer s facility 
in marketing our programs to prospective students  we emphasize the value of the educational experience and the academic rigor and career orientation of the programs  rather than the cost or speed to graduation 
we believe this approach reinforces the qualities that we want associated with our brand and also attracts students who tend to be more persistent in starting and finishing their programs 
recruitment 
once a prospective student has indicated an interest in enrolling in one of our programs  our lead management system identifies and directs an enrollment counselor to initiate immediate communication 
the enrollment counselor serves as the primary  direct contact for the prospective student and the counselor s goal is to help that individual gain sufficient knowledge and understanding of our programs so that he or she can assess whether there is a good match between our offerings and the prospective student s goals 
upon the prospective student s submission of an application  the enrollment counselor  together with our student services personnel  works with the applicant to gain acceptance  arrange financial aid  if needed  register for courses  and prepare for matriculation 
retention 
a key component in retaining our students is providing an outstanding learning experience 
we feel that our team based  proactive approach to recruitment and enhanced student services results in increased retention due to our systematic approach to contacting students at key milestones during their enrollment  providing encouragement and highlighting their achievements 
our financial advisors proactively assist each student with the student s selection of an appropriate payment option  and monitors the student s progress and account balance to ensure a smooth financial aid experience and to help ensure our students are well prepared for their financial obligations incurred 
our academic advisors assist their students with their academic schedules and regularly monitor triggering events  such as the failure to participate in the classroom or failure to matriculate in a timely manner  which signal that a student may be at risk for dropping out 
upon identifying an at risk student  academic advisors proactively interact with the student to resolve any issues and encourage the student to continue with his or her program 
we have found that personally involving our employees in the student educational process  and proactively seeking to resolve issues before they become larger problems  can significantly increase retention rates among students 
these frequent interactions between financial and academic advisors and students are a key component to our retention strategy

this tuition and fees refund policy is different from  and applies in addition to  the return of title iv funds policy we are required to follow as a condition of our participation in the title iv programs 
sources of student financing our students finance their education through a combination of methods  as follows title iv programs 
the federal government provides for grants and loans to students under the title iv programs  and students can use those funds at any institution that has been certified as eligible by the department of education 
student financial aid under the title iv programs is primarily awarded on the basis of a student s financial need  which is generally defined as the difference between the cost of attending the institution and the amount the student and the student s family can reasonably contribute to that cost 
all students receiving title iv program funds must maintain satisfactory academic progress toward completion of their program of study 
in addition  each school must ensure that title iv program funds are properly accounted for and disbursed in the correct amounts to eligible students 

table of contents during fiscal and  we derived approximately and  respectively  of our revenue calculated on a cash basis in accordance with department of education standards that were in effect prior to the august reauthorization of the higher education act from tuition financed under the title iv programs 
during fiscal year  the health care and education reconciliation act was enacted and signed into law 
this legislation  among other things  eliminated the federal family education loan program  or ffel  and required all title iv federal student loans to be administered through the federal direct loan program  or fdl program  commencing july  we completed the transition of loan origination and related servicing from the ffel to the fdl program during the third quarter of fiscal year the primary title iv programs that our students receive funding from are the fdl program  and the federal pell grant  or pell  program 
student loans are currently the most significant source of us federal student aid and are administered through the fdl program 
previously  these loans were also available under the ffel 
annual and aggregate loan limits apply based on the student s grade level 
there are two types of federal student loans subsidized loans  which are based on the us federal statutory calculation of student need  and unsubsidized loans  which are not need based 
neither type of student loan is based on creditworthiness 
students are not responsible for interest on subsidized loans while the student is enrolled in school 
students are responsible for the interest on unsubsidized loans while enrolled in school  but have the option to defer payment while enrolled 
repayment on federal student loans begins six months after the date the student ceases to be enrolled 
the loans are repayable over the course of years and  in some cases  longer 
both graduate and undergraduate students are eligible for loans 
during  federal student loans both subsidized and unsubsidized represented approximately of the gross title iv funds received by the university 
pell grants are awarded based on need and only to undergraduate students who have not earned a bachelor s or professional degree 
unlike loans  pell grants are not repayable 
during fiscal year  pell grants represented approximately of the gross title iv funds received by the university 
the eligibility requirements for  and the maximum amount available under  pell grants have increased in each of the past three years 
our students also receive funding under other title iv programs  including the federal perkins loan program  the federal supplemental educational opportunity grant program  the federal work study program  the national science and mathematics access to retain talent grant program  the academic competitiveness grant program  and the teacher education assistance for college and higher education grant program

in addition to the title iv programs listed above  eligible students may participate in several other financial aid programs or receive support from other governmental sources 
these include veterans educational benefits administered by the us department of veterans affairs and state financial aid programs 
during fiscal and  we derived an immaterial amount of our net revenue from tuition financed by such programs 
private loans 
some of our students also use private loan programs to help finance their education 
students can apply to a number of different lenders for private loans at current market interest rates 
private loans are intended to fund a portion of students cost of education not covered by the title iv programs and other financial aid 
during fiscal and  payments derived from private loans constituted less than of our net revenues for each year respectively 
third party lenders independently determine whether a loan to a student is classified as subprime  and  based on these determinations  we did not derive any payments from subprime loans during fiscal year or other sources 
we derived the remainder of our net revenue from tuition that is self funded or attributable to employer tuition reimbursements 
technology systems and management we believe that we have established a secure  reliable  scalable technology system that provides a high quality online educational environment and gives us the capability to substantially grow our online programs and enrollment 

table of contents online course delivery and management 
our online learning management system is the angel learning management suite  which is a web based system and collaboration portal that stores  manages  and delivers course content  provides interactive communication between students and faculty  enables assignment uploading  and supplies online evaluation tools 
the system also provides centralized administration features that support the implementation of policies for content format and in classroom learning tools 
during  we entered into an agreement with an affiliated entity to develop a new learning management system for use by the university through this agreement we prepaid perpetual license fees  acquired source code rights for the software developed  and prepaid maintenance and service fees for the first seven years of use  for an aggregate amount of million 
we anticipate full conversion to this new learning management platform for our online delivered coursework by the third quarter of we continually seek to develop and implement features that enhance the online classroom experience  such as delivering course content through streaming video  simulations  and other interactive enhancements 
internal administration 
we utilize a commercial customer relations management package to distribute  manage  track  and report on all prospective student leads developed  both internally and externally 
this package is scalable to capacity levels well in excess of current requirements 
we also utilize a commercial software package to track title iv funds  student records  grades  accounts receivable  and accounts payable 
infrastructure 
we operate two data centers  one at our campus and one at our peoria avenue location 
all of our servers are networked and we have redundant data backup 
we manage our technology environment internally 
our wide area network uses multi protocol label switching technology for maximum availability and flexibility 
student access is load balanced for maximum performance 
real time monitoring provides current system status across server  network  and storage components 
ground campus we own our ground campus  which is located on approximately acres in the center of the phoenix  arizona metropolitan area  near downtown phoenix 
our on campus facilities currently consist of buildings with more than  square feet of space  which include classrooms  two lecture halls  a seat theater  four student computer labs with computers that are available to students hours per day  a  volume library  a media arts complex that provides communications students with audio and video equipment  and a  square foot recreation center for both student athletes and on campus students 
we house our ground students in an on campus student apartment complex and two dormitories that can collectively hold up to  students 
a new  square foot arena will open in september  and a new bed dormitory and a food court restaurant will be completed in august we have intercollegiate athletic teams that compete in division ii of the national collegiate athletic association ncaa 
our athletic facilities include a competition practice gymnasium  which accommodates basketball  volleyball  and wrestling competitive events 
in addition  the university has a student recreation center that has state of the art training facilities for our student athletes plus practice space and locker rooms for men s and women s basketball and wrestling 
our baseball  softball  soccer and lacrosse programs utilize on campus practice and competition sites 
golf  tennis  cross country  track and field and swimming programs utilize off campus sites for practice and competition 
our baseball program has produced major league baseball players while the men s basketball program has produced a pair of nba players 
baseball  basketball  tennis and soccer have combined to produce nine national association of intercollegiate athletics naia or ncaa national championship teams 
we believe our ground based programs and traditional campus not only offer our ground students  faculty  and staff an opportunity to participate in a traditional college experience  but also provide our online students  faculty  and staff with a sense of connection to a traditional university 
additionally  our full time ground faculty play an important role in integrating online faculty into our academic programs and ensuring the overall consistency and quality of the ground and online student experience 
we believe our mix of a rapidly growing online program  anchored by a traditional ground based program with a year history and heritage  differentiates us from most other for profit postsecondary education providers 
we intend to continue to expand the size and enhance the profile and reputation of our ground campus by  among other things  adding faculty and expanding upon and modernizing our campus infrastructure and technological capabilities over the next several years 
these activities may require significant capital expenditures and may cause us to incur significant expenses 

table of contents employees in addition to our faculty  as of december   we employed approximately  staff and administrative personnel in university services  academic advising and academic support  enrollment services  university administration  financial aid  information technology  human resources  corporate accounting  finance  and other administrative functions 
none of our employees is a party to any collective bargaining or similar agreement with us 
we consider our relationships with our employees to be good 
competition there are more than  us colleges and universities serving traditional and adult students 
competition is highly fragmented and varies by geography  program offerings  modality  ownership  quality level  and selectivity of admissions 
no one institution has a significant share of the total postsecondary market 
our ground program competes with arizona state university  northern arizona university  and the university of arizona  the in state public universities  as well as two year colleges within the state community college system 
to a limited extent  our ground program also competes with geographically proximate universities with similar religious heritages  including azusa pacific university  baylor university  and seattle pacific university 
our online programs compete with local  traditional universities geographically located near each of our prospective students  and with other for profit postsecondary schools that offer online degrees  particularly those schools that offer online graduate programs within our core disciplines  including capella university  university of phoenix  and walden university 
in addition  many public and private schools  colleges  and universities  including most major colleges and universities  offer online programs 
non profit institutions receive substantial government subsidies  and have access to government and foundation grants  tax deductible contributions and other financial resources generally not available to for profit schools 
accordingly  non profit institutions may have instructional and support resources that are superior to those in the for profit sector 
in addition  some of our competitors  including both traditional colleges and universities and other for profit schools  have substantially greater name recognition and financial resources than we have  which may enable them to compete more effectively for potential students 
we also expect to face increased competition as a result of new entrants to the online education market  including established colleges and universities that had not previously offered online education programs 
we believe that the competitive factors in the postsecondary education market include availability of career oriented and accredited program offerings  the types of degrees offered and marketability of those degrees  reputation  regulatory approvals  and compliance history of the school  convenient  flexible and dependable access to programs and classes  qualified and experienced faculty  level of student support services  cost of the program  marketing and selling effectiveness  and the time necessary to earn a degree

table of contents regulation we are subject to extensive regulation by state education agencies  accrediting commissions  and the federal government through the department of education under the higher education act 
the regulations  standards  and policies of these agencies cover the vast majority of our operations  including our educational programs  facilities  instructional and administrative staff  administrative procedures  marketing  recruiting  financial operations  and financial condition 
as an institution of higher education that grants degrees and certificates  we are required to be authorized by appropriate state education authorities 
these state education authorities also exercise regulatory oversight of our institution 
in addition  in order to participate in the federal student financial aid programs  we must be accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by the department of education 
accreditation is a non governmental process through which an institution submits to qualitative review by an organization of peer institutions  based on the standards of the accrediting commission and the stated aims and purposes of the institution 
the higher education act requires accrediting commissions recognized by the department of education to review and monitor many aspects of an institution s operations and to take appropriate action if the institution fails to meet the accrediting commission s standards 
our operations are also subject to regulation by the department of education due to our participation in the federal student financial aid programs under title iv of the higher education act 
those title iv programs include educational loans with below market interest rates that are issued by the federal government under the federal direct loan program the fdl program  as well as grant programs for students with demonstrated financial need 
to participate in the title iv programs  a school must receive and maintain authorization by the appropriate state education agency or agencies  be accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by the department of education  and be certified as an eligible institution by the department of education 
our business activities are planned and implemented to comply with the standards of these regulatory agencies 
we employ a vice president of student financial aid compliance who is knowledgeable about regulatory matters relevant to student financial aid programs and our chief financial officer  chief compliance officer  and general counsel also provide oversight designed to ensure that we meet the requirements of our regulated operating environment 
state education licensure and regulation we are authorized to offer our educational programs by the arizona state board for private postsecondary education  the regulatory agency governing private postsecondary educational institutions in the state of arizona  where we are located 
we do not presently have campuses in any states other than arizona 
we are required by the higher education act to maintain authorization from the arizona state board for private postsecondary education in order to participate in the title iv programs 
this authorization is very important to us and our business 
to maintain our state authorization  we must continuously meet standards relating to  among other things  educational programs  facilities  instructional and administrative staff  marketing and recruitment  financial operations  addition of new locations and educational programs  and various operational and administrative procedures 
our failure to comply with the requirements of the arizona state board for private postsecondary education could result in us losing our authorization to offer our educational programs  which would cause us to lose our eligibility to participate in the title iv programs and could force us to cease operations 
alternatively  the arizona state board for private postsecondary education could restrict our ability to offer certain degree and non degree programs 
most other states impose regulatory requirements on out of state educational institutions operating within their boundaries  such as those having a physical facility or conducting certain academic activities within the state 
state laws establish standards in areas such as instruction  qualifications of faculty  administrative procedures  marketing  recruiting  financial operations  and other operational matters  some of which are different than the standards prescribed by the department of education or the arizona state board for private postsecondary education 
laws in some states limit schools ability to offer educational programs and award degrees to residents of those states 
some states also prescribe financial regulations that are different from those of the department of education  and many require the posting of surety bonds 

table of contents several states have sought to assert jurisdiction over educational institutions offering online degree programs that have no physical location or other presence in the state but that have some activity in the state  such as enrolling or offering educational services to students who reside in the state  employing faculty who reside in the state  or advertising to or recruiting prospective students in the state 
in addition  the department of education has adopted new regulations that require online providers to meet any such state requirements and  thus  the department of education would seem to have authority  in addition to that of the states  to enforce applicable state law requirements 
see new and pending regulations state authorization 
because state regulatory requirements for online education vary among the states  are not well developed in many states  are imprecise or unclear in some states  and can change frequently  it is unclear how the new department of education regulation will be enforced and what impact it will have on us 
new laws  regulations  or interpretations related to doing business over the internet could also increase our cost of doing business and affect our ability to recruit students in particular states  which could  in turn  negatively affect enrollments and revenues and have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have determined that our activities in certain states constitute a presence requiring licensure or authorization under the requirements of the applicable state education agency in those states and we have obtained such licensure 
in other states  we have obtained approvals as we have determined necessary in connection with our marketing and recruiting activities or where we have determined that our licensure or authorization can facilitate the teaching certification process in a particular state for graduates of our college of education 
we review the licensure or authorization requirements of other states when appropriate to determine whether our activities in those states constitute a presence or otherwise require licensure or authorization by the applicable state education agencies 
because state regulatory requirements  including agency interpretations  can change frequently  and because we enroll students in all states and the district of columbia  we expect that state regulatory authorities in states where we are not currently licensed or authorized will request that we seek licensure or authorization in their states in the future 
although we believe that we will be able to comply with additional state licensing or authorization requirements that may arise or be asserted in the future  including under the new department of education regulation  if we fail to comply with state licensing or authorization requirements for a state  or fail to obtain licenses or authorizations when required  we could lose our state licensure or authorization by that state or be subject to other sanctions  including restrictions on our activities in  and fines and penalties imposed by  that state  as well as fines  penalties  and sanctions imposed by the department of education 
while we do not believe that any of the states in which we are currently licensed or authorized  other than arizona  are individually material to our operations  the loss of licensure or authorization in any state could prohibit us from recruiting prospective students or offering services to current students in that state  which could significantly reduce our enrollments 
state professional licensure many states have specific requirements that an individual must satisfy in order to be licensed as a professional in specified fields  including fields such as education and healthcare 
these requirements vary by state and by field 
a student s success in obtaining licensure following graduation typically depends on several factors  including the background and qualifications of the individual graduate  as well as the following factors  among others whether the institution and the program were approved by the state in which the graduate seeks licensure  or by a professional association  whether the program from which the student graduated meets all requirements for professional licensure in that state  whether the institution and the program are accredited and  if so  by what accrediting commissions  and whether the institution s degrees are recognized by other states in which a student may seek to work 
many states also require that graduates pass a state test or examination as a prerequisite to becoming certified in certain fields  such as teaching and nursing 
many states will certify individuals if they have already been certified in another state 

table of contents our college of education is approved by the arizona state board of education to offer institutional recommendations credentials for the certification of elementary  secondary  and special education teachers and school administrators 
our college of nursing and health services is approved by the arizona state board of nursing for the bachelor of science in nursing and master of science in nursing degrees 
due to varying requirements for professional licensure and certification in states other than arizona  we inform students of the risks associated with obtaining professional licensure or certification and that it is each student s responsibility to determine what state  local or professional licensure and certification requirements are necessary in his or her individual state 
accreditation we have been continuously accredited since by the higher learning commission and its predecessor  each a regional accrediting commission recognized by the department of education 
our accreditation was reaffirmed in  and the next scheduled comprehensive evaluation will be conducted in accreditation is a private  non governmental process for evaluating the quality of educational institutions and their programs in areas including student performance  governance  integrity  educational quality  faculty  physical resources  administrative capability and resources  and financial stability 
to be recognized by the department of education  accrediting commissions must adopt specific standards for their review of educational institutions  conduct peer review evaluations of institutions  and publicly designate those institutions that meet their criteria 
an accredited school is subject to periodic review by its accrediting commissions to determine whether it continues to meet the performance  integrity and quality required for accreditation 
there are six regional accrediting commissions recognized by the department of education  each with a specified geographic scope of coverage  which together cover the entire united states 
most traditional  public and private non profit  degree granting colleges and universities are accredited by one of these six regional accrediting commissions 
the higher learning commission  which accredits grand canyon university  is the same regional accrediting commission that accredits such universities as the university of arizona  arizona state university  and other degree granting public  private non profit  and proprietary colleges and universities in the states of arizona  arkansas  colorado  illinois  indiana  iowa  kansas  michigan  minnesota  missouri  nebraska  new mexico  north dakota  ohio  oklahoma  south dakota  west virginia  wisconsin  and wyoming 
accreditation by the higher learning commission is important to us for several reasons  including the fact that it enables our students to receive title iv financial aid 
other colleges and universities depend  in part  on an institution s accreditation in evaluating transfers of credit and applications to graduate schools 
employers rely on the accredited status of institutions when evaluating candidates credentials  and students and corporate and government sponsors under tuition reimbursement programs look to accreditation for assurance that an institution maintains quality educational standards 
if we fail to satisfy the standards of the higher learning commission  we could lose our accreditation by that agency  which would cause us to lose our eligibility to participate in the title iv programs 
the reauthorization of the higher education act in and final regulations thereunder issued by the department of education that became effective july  require accreditors to monitor the growth of programs at institutions that are experiencing significant enrollment growth 
the higher learning commission requires all affiliated institutions to complete an annual data report 
if the non financial data  particularly enrollment information  and any other information submitted by the institution indicate problems  rapid change  or significant growth  the higher learning commission staff may require that the institution address any concerns arising from the data report in the next self study and visit process 
the higher learning commission staff may also recommend that its institutional actions council require additional monitoring 
in addition  the department of education has issued final regulations that became effective july  that require the higher learning commission to notify the department of education if an institution it accredits that offers distance learning programs experiences an increase in its headcount enrollment of or more in any fiscal year  and the department of education may consider that information in connection with its own regulatory oversight activities 

table of contents in addition to institutional accreditation by the higher learning commission  there are numerous specialized accrediting commissions that accredit specific programs or schools within their jurisdiction  many of which are in healthcare and professional fields 
accreditation of specific programs by one of these specialized accrediting commissions signifies that those programs have met the additional standards of those agencies 
in addition to being accredited by the higher learning commission  we also have the following specialized accreditations the association of collegiate business schools and programs accredits our executive master of business administration degree program  master of business administration degree program and our bachelor of science degree programs in accounting  business administration  marketing  and entrepreneurship  the commission on collegiate nursing education accredits our bachelor of science in nursing and master of science in nursing degree programs  and the commission on accreditation of athletic training education accredits our athletic training program 
if we fail to satisfy the standards of any of these specialized accrediting commissions  we could lose the specialized accreditation for the affected programs  which could result in materially reduced student enrollments in those programs and prevent our students from seeking and obtaining appropriate licensure in their fields 
regulation of federal student financial aid programs to be eligible to participate in the title iv programs  an institution must comply with specific requirements contained in the higher education act and the regulations issued thereunder by the department of education 
an institution must  among other things  be licensed or authorized to offer its educational programs by the state in which it is physically located in our case  arizona and maintain institutional accreditation by an accrediting commission recognized by the department of education in our case  the higher learning commission 
we submitted our application for recertification to participate in the title iv programs to the department of education in march in anticipation of the expiration of our provisional certification on june  the department of education did not make a decision on our recertification application by june   and therefore our participation in the title iv programs has been automatically extended on a month to month basis until the department of education makes its decision 
the substantial amount of federal funds disbursed to schools through the title iv programs  the large number of students and institutions participating in these programs  and allegations of fraud and abuse by certain for profit educational institutions have caused congress to require the department of education to exercise considerable regulatory oversight over for profit educational institutions 
as a result  our institution is subject to extensive oversight and review 
because the department of education periodically revises its regulations and changes its interpretations of existing laws and regulations  we cannot predict with certainty how the title iv program requirements will be applied in all circumstances 
significant factors relating to the title iv programs that could adversely affect us include the following congressional action 
congress must reauthorize the higher education act on a periodic basis  usually every five to six years  and the most recent reauthorization occurred in august the reauthorized higher education act reauthorized all of the title iv programs in which we participate  but made numerous revisions to the requirements governing the title iv programs  including provisions relating to student loan default rates and the formula for determining the maximum amount of revenue that institutions are permitted to derive from the title iv programs 
in  congress enacted legislation  which became effective july   that eliminated the federally guaranteed student loan program and required all such student loans to be made through the fdl program 
we are not in a position to predict with certainty whether any other pending  or any proposed  legislation affecting our business will be enacted 
although we are approved to participate in the fdl program  because a significant percentage of our revenue is derived from the title iv programs  any action by congress that significantly reduces title iv program funding or our ability or the ability of our students to participate in the title iv programs could increase our costs of compliance  reduce the ability of some students to finance their education at our institution  require us to seek to arrange for other sources of financial aid for our students and materially decrease our student enrollment 

table of contents in addition  congress must determine the funding levels for the title iv programs on an annual basis through the budget and appropriations process  and may adjust those levels at other times 
a reduction in federal funding levels for the title iv programs could reduce the ability of some of our students to finance their education 
the loss of or a significant reduction in title iv program funds available to our students could reduce our enrollments and revenue 
during and since  there has been increased focus by the congress on the role that for profit educational institutions play in higher education 
each of the congressional education committees held one or more hearings examining various aspects of the proprietary education industry  including the manner in which accrediting agencies review higher education institutions policies on credit hours and program length  student recruitment practices  and the debt levels incurred by  and drop out rates of  students attending for profit colleges 
in addition  at the request of the chairmen of each of these committees  the government accountability office gao conducted reviews and prepared reports with recommendations regarding various aspects of the proprietary sector  including recruitment practices  educational quality  student outcomes  the sufficiency of integrity safeguards against waste  fraud and abuse in federal student aid programs and the degree to which proprietary institutions revenue is composed of title iv and other federal funding sources 
finally  in august  the health  education  labor and pensions help committee of the us senate sent requests to approximately for profit colleges  including us and all of the other publicly traded companies that operate for profit colleges  seeking information about such matters as graduation and loan default rates  as well as internal recruiting documents and details about the use of third party companies  such as lead generators  in the recruiting process 
the request sought information concerning how we use federal resources  including how we recruit and enroll students  set program price or tuition  determine financial aid including private or institutional loans  track attendance  handle withdrawals of students and return of title iv dollars and manage compliance with the requirement that no more than of revenues come from title iv dollars calculated on a cash basis 
the request also sought an understanding of the number of students who complete or graduate from programs we offer  how many of those students find new work in their educational area  the debt levels of students enrolling and completing programs and how we track and manage the number of students who risk default within the cohort default rate window 
in furtherance of this  the help committee requested that we provide information about a broad spectrum of our business  including detailed information relating to financial results  management  operations  personnel  recruiting  enrollment  graduation  student withdrawals  receipt of title iv funds  institutional accreditation  regulatory compliance and other matters 
we complied with the help committee s request and believe that we have completed the document production necessary to satisfy the request 
we cannot predict the extent to which  or whether  these hearings and review will result in additional legislation  further rulemaking or other administrative actions affecting our participation in title iv programs 
to the extent that any laws or regulations are adopted  or other administrative actions are taken  that limit our participation in title iv programs or the amount of student financial aid for which the students at our institutions are eligible  our enrollments  revenues and results of operation could be materially and adversely affected 
pending regulatory changes 
in may  the department of education announced its intent to initiate a round of negotiated rulemaking to address title iv program integrity issues 
negotiated rulemaking is a process whereby the department of education consults with members of the postsecondary education community to identify issues of concern and attempts to agree on proposed regulatory revisions to address those issues before the department of education formally proposes any regulations 
if the department of education and negotiators cannot reach consensus on their entire package of draft regulations  the department of education is authorized to propose regulations without being bound by any agreements made in the negotiation process 
that process was concluded for a significant number of regulatory topics in january and addressed a number of significant issues  including compensation paid by institutions to persons or entities engaged in student recruiting or admission activities  the determination of satisfactory academic progress under different academic calendars  state authorization as a component of institutional eligibility  the definition of a credit hour for purposes of determining program eligibility status  particularly in the context of awarding pell grants  verification of information included on student aid applications  the definition of a high school diploma as a condition of a student s receipt of title iv aid and requirements that an institution be able to demonstrate that its graduates obtain gainful employment  as measured against certain metrics such as student loan debt and salaries of graduates 
of the proposed revisions to the regulations being considered in this negotiated rulemaking  the negotiators did not reach consensus on the proposals to modify the standards relating to the payment of incentive compensation to employees involved in student recruitment and enrollment and to adopt a definition of gainful employment for purposes of the requirement placed on proprietary schools that participate in title iv programs that a program of study prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation 
accordingly  under the negotiated rulemaking protocol  the department of education became authorized to propose regulations with respect to these topics without regard to the concerns of institutions as expressed during the negotiated rulemaking process 

table of contents on june   the department of education issued a notice of proposed rulemaking nprm in respect of the incentive compensation rule and other program integrity issues  other than the metrics for determining compliance with the gainful employment requirement 
the final rules on these topics were published on october  and will become effective on july  the changes to the incentive compensation rule and other program integrity issues are discussed below under new and pending regulations revised incentive compensation rule  new and pending regulations misrepresentation  and new and pending regulations state authorization 
on july   the department of education issued an nprm in respect of the proposed gainful employment requirement  while the department of education previously stated that its goal was to publish final rules related to the gainful employment requirement by november  and to have the final rules be effective july  with certain provisions to be effective july   due to the unprecedented volume of comments received regarding the proposed rules  on september   the department of education announced that it would delay issuing final rules until early in order to give interested parties more time to clarify their comments and respond to questions from department of education officials 
the final gainful employment rules have yet to be released 
the proposed gainful employment rules are discussed below under new and pending regulations proposed gainful employment rule 
we are still assessing the impact of the final regulations  including those implementing changes to the incentive compensation rule  and the possible impact of the proposed gainful employment rules on our financial aid policies and practices and on our other operations  plans  and strategies 
at this time  we cannot predict with any certainty whether compliance with such new requirements will result in a material adverse effect on our enrollments and operations 
eligibility and certification procedures 
each institution must apply periodically to the department of education for continued certification to participate in the title iv programs 
such recertification generally is required every six years  but may be required earlier  including when an institution undergoes a change in control 
an institution may also come under the department of education s review when it expands its activities in certain ways  such as opening an additional location  adding a new educational program or modifying the academic credentials it offers 
the department of education may place an institution on provisional certification status if it finds that the institution does not fully satisfy all of the eligibility and certification standards and in certain other circumstances  such as when an institution is certified for the first time or undergoes a change in control 
during the period of provisional certification  the institution must comply with any additional conditions included in the school s program participation agreement with the department of education 
in addition  the department of education may more closely review an institution that is provisionally certified if it applies for recertification or approval to open a new location  add an educational program  acquire another school  or make any other significant change 
if the department of education determines that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement  it may seek to revoke the institution s certification to participate in the title iv programs without advance notice or opportunity for the institution to challenge the action 
students attending provisionally certified institutions remain eligible to receive title iv program funds 
since may  we have been certified to participate in title iv programs on a provisional basis 
we submitted our application for recertification in march in anticipation of the expiration of our provisional certification on june  the department of education did not make a decision on our recertification application by june   and therefore our provisional certification to participate in the title iv programs has been automatically extended since that time on a month to month basis until the department of education makes its decision 
since june  we have filed updates with the department of education and communicated with department of education personnel in order to update our pending recertification application with relevant information  such as our status as a publicly traded corporation  the identity of the members of our board of directors  and the termination of the voting agreements in january based on our provisional certification  the department of education may more closely review any application we may file for recertification  new locations  new educational programs  acquisitions of other schools  or other significant 
table of contents changes 
for a school that is certified on a provisional basis  the department of education may revoke the institution s certification without advance notice or advance opportunity for the institution to challenge that action 
for a school that is provisionally certified on a month to month basis  like we are  the department of education may allow the institution s certification to expire at the end of any month without advance notice  and without any formal procedure for review of such action 
to our knowledge  such action is very rare and has only occurred upon a determination that an institution is in substantial violation of material title iv requirements 
to date  we do not believe that our continued provisional certification on a month to month basis has had or will have any material impact on our day to day operations 
however  there can be no assurance that the department of education will recertify us or that it will not impose conditions or other restrictions on us as a condition of granting us provisional certification following a change in control or approving our pending recertification application or with respect to any future recertification 
if the department of education does not renew or withdraws our certification to participate in the title iv programs at any time  our students would no longer be able to receive title iv program funds 
similarly  the department of education could renew our certification  but restrict or delay our students receipt of title iv funds  limit the number of students to whom we could disburse such funds  or place other restrictions on us 
any of these outcomes would have a material adverse effect on our enrollments and us 
administrative capability 
department of education regulations specify extensive criteria by which an institution must establish that it has the requisite administrative capability to participate in the title iv programs 
to meet the administrative capability standards  an institution must  among other things comply with all applicable title iv program requirements  have an adequate number of qualified personnel to administer the title iv programs  have acceptable standards for measuring the satisfactory academic progress of its students  not have student loan cohort default rates above specified levels  have various procedures in place for awarding  disbursing and safeguarding title iv funds and for maintaining required records  administer the title iv programs with adequate checks and balances in its system of internal controls  not be  and not have any principal or affiliate who is  debarred or suspended from federal contracting or engaging in activity that is cause for debarment or suspension  provide financial aid counseling to its students  refer to the department of education s office of inspector general any credible information indicating that any student  parent  employee  third party servicer or other agent of the institution has engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving the title iv programs  submit all required reports and financial statements in a timely manner  and not otherwise appear to lack administrative capability 
if an institution fails to satisfy any of these criteria  the department of education may require the institution to repay title iv funds its students previously received  transfer the institution from the advance method of payment of title iv funds to heightened cash monitoring status or the reimbursement system of payment  place the institution on provisional certification status  or commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit  suspend or terminate the institution s participation in the title iv programs 

table of contents if we are found not to have satisfied the department of education s administrative capability requirements  our students could lose  or be limited in their access to  title iv program funding 
new department of education regulations that became effective july  revised the administrative capability regulations to  among other things i require reporting to the department of education of any reasonable reimbursements paid or provided by a lender to institutional employees with loan or other financial aid responsibilities and ii implement the new three year cohort default rate rules 
see regulation of student financial aid programs student loan defaults 
we have had to make certain administrative and reporting changes to adapt our systems and practices to meet the requirements of these new regulations 
in addition  as part of our transition from a term based financial aid system where all students  including online students  begin programs and are eligible to receive financial aid at periodic start dates pursuant to a calendar based term system to a borrower based financial aid system where each student may begin a program and be eligible to receive financial aid at any time throughout the year in the spring of  we converted our back office system from datatel  inc to a series of programs developed by campus management corp  including campusvue and campusportal 
this conversion is intended to allow us to manage our non traditional online students with greater ease and flexibility by providing for rolling and flexible start dates 
financial responsibility 
the higher education act and department of education regulations establish extensive standards of financial responsibility that institutions such as grand canyon university must satisfy in order to participate in the title iv programs 
the department of education evaluates institutions for compliance with these standards on an annual basis based on the institution s annual audited financial statements  as well as when the institution applies to the department of education to have its eligibility to participate in the title iv programs recertified 
the most significant financial responsibility standard is the institution s composite score  which is derived from a formula established by the department of education based on three financial ratios equity ratio  which measures the institution s capital resources  financial viability and ability to borrow  primary reserve ratio  which measures the institution s ability to support current operations from expendable resources  and net income ratio  which measures the institution s ability to operate at a profit or within its means 
the department of education assigns a strength factor to the results of each of these ratios on a scale from negative to positive  with negative reflecting financial weakness and positive reflecting financial strength 
the department of education then assigns a weighting percentage to each ratio and adds the weighted scores for the three ratios together to produce a composite score for the institution 
the composite score for the institution s most recent fiscal year must be at least for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without the need for further department of education oversight 
our composite scores for our fiscal years ended december  and were each year and  therefore  we are considered financially responsible for purposes of these regulations 
we have not yet submitted our financial statements to the department of education for our most recent fiscal year  but have calculated that our composite score for fiscal year will be at least in addition to having an acceptable composite score  an institution must  among other things  provide the administrative resources necessary to comply with title iv program requirements  meet all of its financial obligations  including required refunds to students and any title iv liabilities and debts  be current in its debt payments  and not receive an adverse  qualified  or disclaimed opinion by its accountants in its audited financial statements 
if the department of education were to determine that we did not meet the financial responsibility standards due to a failure to meet the composite score or other factors  we would expect to be able to establish financial responsibility on an alternative basis permitted by the department of education  which could include  in the department of education s discretion  posting a letter of credit  accepting provisional certification  complying with additional department of education monitoring requirements  agreeing to receive title iv program funds under an arrangement other than the department of education s standard advance funding arrangement  such as the reimbursement system of payment or heightened cash monitoring  and complying with or accepting other limitations on our ability to increase the number of programs we offer or the number of students we enroll 

table of contents the requirement to post a letter of credit or other sanctions imposed by the department of education could increase our cost of regulatory compliance and adversely affect our cash flows 
if we are unable to meet the minimum composite score or comply with the other standards of financial responsibility  and could not post a required letter of credit or comply with the alternative bases for establishing financial responsibility  our students could lose their access to title iv program funding 
return of title iv funds for students who withdraw 
when a student who has received title iv program funds withdraws from school  the institution must determine the amount of title iv program funds the student has earned and then must return the unearned title iv program funds a return to title iv to the appropriate lender or the department of education in a timely manner  which is generally no later than days after the date the institution determined that the student withdrew 
if such payments are not timely made  the institution will be required to submit a letter of credit to the department of education equal to of the title iv funds that the institution should have returned for withdrawn students in its most recently completed fiscal year 
under department of education regulations  the letter of credit requirement is triggered by late returns of title iv program funds for or more of the withdrawn students in the audit sample in the institution s annual title iv compliance audit for either of the institution s two most recent fiscal years or in a department of education program review 
we did not exceed this threshold in our annual title iv compliance audits for the most recent year for which we have completed a title iv compliance audit  or prior to spring  we operated in a term based environment in which  in accordance with department of education regulations  we calculated our returns to title iv based on the number of completed days in a term as a percentage of the total days in the term  with the exception that  with respect to courses offered in a modular setting ie those offered to nontraditional students as two eight week courses  or modules  in a term  if a student completed the first course but withdrew prior to the second course  then the full financial aid award was earned by and paid to the student and no return to title iv calculation was done 
in april  we converted from a term based environment to a non term  borrower based environment 
in a non term  borrower based environment  we operate on a credit academic year credit payment period for our undergraduate students  who must take three courses during each payment period  and a credit academic year credit payment period for our graduate students  who must take two courses during each payment period  and  as a result  we now calculate returns to title iv based on the percentage of the payment period attended in comparison to the full payment period there is no module concept in a non term  borrower based environment 
in this environment  a student whether undergraduate or graduate must complete greater than of the payment period in order to earn the full financial aid award 
thus  if a student completes the first course but withdraws prior to the second one and therefore does not complete greater than of the payment period  then the full financial aid award is not earned by the student 
in such case  we must perform a return to title iv calculation and most  if not all of the funds for future courses  would be returned to the lender or the department of education 
if the student withdraws after the threshold  then the student is deemed to have earned of the title iv program funds he or she received 
since  under the non term  borrower based system  a student generally must complete two of the courses in a payment period to earn the full financial aid award  as opposed to just a single course under the term based module approach  we have experienced an increase in the title iv funds that needed to be returned to lenders or the department of education 
the rule 
a requirement of the higher education act  commonly referred to as the rule  that is applicable only to for profit  postsecondary educational institutions like us  provides that an institution loses its eligibility to participate in the title iv programs if the institution derives more than of its revenue for each of two consecutive fiscal years from title iv program funds 
for purposes of the rule  revenue is calculated under a complex regulatory formula that requires cash basis accounting and other adjustments to the calculation of an institution s revenue under generally accepted accounting principles that appears in its financial statements 
this rule provides that an institution that violates this revenue limit becomes ineligible to participate in the title iv programs as of the first day of the fiscal year following the second consecutive fiscal year in which it exceeds the threshold  and its period of ineligibility extends for at least two consecutive fiscal years 
if an institution exceeds the threshold for two consecutive fiscal years and it and its students have received title iv funds during the period of ineligibility  the institution will be required to return those title iv funds to the applicable lender or the department of education 
if an institution s rate exceeds for any single fiscal year  it will be placed on provisional certification for at least two fiscal years 

table of contents the august reauthorization of the higher education act included significant revisions to the rule that became effective upon the date of the law s enactment  including provisions that allow institutions  when calculating their compliance with this revenue test  to exclude from their title iv program revenue for a three year period ending june  the additional federal student loan amounts that became available through the unsubsidized stafford loan program starting in july  and to include more non title iv revenue  such as revenue from institutional loans under certain circumstances 
given the level of complexity of this calculation we are unable to quantify precisely the benefit that we have derived or will derive in the percentage from these temporary exclusions 
as such  our reported rates below exclude the benefits from these exclusions 
using the department of education s cash basis  regulatory formula under the rule that was in effect prior to the august reauthorization of the higher education act  for our  and fiscal years  we derived approximately   and  respectively  of our rule revenue from title iv program funds 
these rates have been reviewed by our financial accounting firm as reflected in the notes to our audited financial statements for each fiscal year 
as a result of recent changes in federal law that increased title iv grant and loan limits  as well as the recent economic downturn  which has adversely affected the employment circumstances of our students and their parents and increased their reliance on title iv programs  we expect the percentage of our revenue that we receive from the title iv programs to continue to increase in the future  making it more difficult for us to satisfy this requirement 
exceeding the threshold such that we lost our eligibility to participate in the title iv programs would have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition  and results of operations student loan defaults 
under the higher education act  an educational institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all of the title iv programs if defaults by its students on the repayment of their federal student loans exceed certain levels 
for each federal fiscal year  the department of education calculates a rate of student defaults for each institution known as a cohort default rate 
an institution s cohort default rate for a federal fiscal year historically has been calculated by determining the rate at which borrowers who became subject to their repayment obligation in one federal fiscal year default in that same year or by the end of the following federal fiscal year the two year method 
the reauthorization of the higher education act in extended the measurement period for cohort default rates so that the rate is calculated by determining the rate at which borrowers who became subject to their repayment obligation in one federal fiscal year default in that same year or by the end of the second following federal fiscal year the three year method  which is expected to increase cohort default rates for most if not all institutions 
in december and february  the department of education issued trial cohort default rates that were calculated for federal fiscal years   and as if the extended period to count student defaults already applied to those prior years 
the department of education stated that it released this data for informational purposes only  to assist institutions in anticipating how the extended period to count student defaults might affect their future cohort default rates when that extended period is actually implemented 
based on the department of education s release of this information  our default rates for these prior years increased  as set forth below 
while the trial cohort default rates are informative for prior periods  they do not enable us to predict or estimate with any degree of certainty the extent of the expected increase in our cohort default rates for future federal fiscal years when the new extended period to measure student defaults is put into effect  or whether any such increase will affect our participation in the title iv programs 
the department of education has issued a final regulation indicating that it will begin to implement this extended measurement period for the cohort default rates that will be calculated for loans that enter repayment in federal fiscal year  which is the year that ended on september  the department of education has included a transition period of three years during which it will calculate two cohort default rates for each institution for each of federal fiscal years  and  with one such rate measured under the two year method and the other such rate measured under the three year method 
the cohort default rates for federal fiscal years  and  as calculated under the new three year method  are not expected to be published until calendar years  and 
table of contents the department of education will apply different legal thresholds to measure an institution s compliance under each set of rates 
if the department of education notifies an institution that its cohort default rates exceed  as calculated under the two year method  for each of its three most recent federal fiscal years  or exceed  as calculated under the three year method  for each of its three most recent federal fiscal years  the institution s participation in the the fdl program and the pell grant program will end days after that notification  unless the institution appeals that determination in a timely manner on specified grounds and according to specified procedures 
in addition  an institution s participation in the fdl program will end days after notification by the department of education that its most recent cohort default rate  as calculated under either the two year method or the three year method  is greater than  unless the institution timely appeals that determination on specified grounds and according to specified procedures 
an institution whose participation ends under either of these provisions may not participate in the relevant programs for the remainder of the fiscal year in which the institution receives the notification or for the next two fiscal years 
if an institution s cohort default rate for any single federal fiscal year equals or exceeds under the two year method  or under the three year method  the department of education may place the institution on provisional certification status 
our cohort default rates  under the two year method  on federal student loans for the   and federal fiscal years  the three most recent years for which such rates have been calculated  were   and  respectively 
our trial cohort default rates  under the three year method  for the   and federal fiscal years  as issued by the department of education  were   and  respectively 
incentive compensation rule 
an institution that participates in the title iv programs may not provide any commission  bonus  or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid to any person or entity engaged in any student recruitment  admissions  or financial aid awarding activity 
under current department of education regulations  there are safe harbors that describe payments and arrangements that do not violate the incentive compensation rule 
for example  one of these safe harbors permits adjustments to fixed salary for enrollment personnel provided that such adjustments are not made more than twice during any twelve month period  and that any adjustment is not based solely on the number of students recruited  admitted  enrolled  or awarded financial aid  but the regulations do not address other practices  such as the provision of non cash awards to enrollment personnel 
the restrictions of the incentive compensation rule also extend to any third party companies that an educational institution contracts with for student recruitment  admissions  or financial aid awarding services 
historically  we have relied on several of these safe harbors to ensure that our compensation and recruitment practices comply with the applicable requirements  and the department of education s regulations made clear that the safe harbors were not a complete list of permissible practices under this law 
in the final rules issued by the department of education in respect of the incentive compensation rule and other program integrity issues described above  which will become effective on july   the safe harbors under the incentive compensation rule were eliminated 
see new and pending regulations revised incentive compensation rule 
in recent years  several for profit education companies have been faced with whistleblower lawsuits  known as qui tam cases  brought by current or former employees alleging that their institution had made impermissible incentive payments 
a qui tam case is a civil lawsuit brought by one or more individuals a relator on behalf of the federal government for an alleged submission to the government of a false claim for payment 
the relator  often a current or former employee  is entitled to a share of the government s recovery in the case 
a qui tam action is always filed under seal and remains under seal until the government decides whether to intervene in the case 
if the government intervenes  it takes over primary control of the litigation 
if the government declines to intervene in the case  the relator may nonetheless elect to continue to pursue the litigation at his or her own expense on behalf of the government 
on september   we were served with a qui tam lawsuit that had been filed against us in august  in the united states district court for the district of arizona by a then current employee on behalf of the federal government 
this qui tam lawsuit has now been settled 
see item legal proceedings 
the office of inspector general of the department of education is responsible for  among other things  promoting the effectiveness and integrity of the department of education s programs and operations  including compliance with applicable statutes and regulations 
the office of inspector general performs investigations of alleged violations of law  including cases of alleged fraud and abuse  or other identified vulnerabilities  in programs administered or financed by the department of education  including matters related to the incentive compensation rule 
on august   the office of inspector general  in connection with the qui tam case described above  served an administrative subpoena on grand canyon university requiring us to provide certain records and information related to performance reviews and salary adjustments for all of our enrollment counselors and managers from january  to august we cooperated with the oig to facilitate its investigation and completed our rolling responsive document production  which commenced in september  in june in light of the settlement of the qui tam litigation described below  we believe that this investigation has effectively ended

table of contents compliance reviews 
we are subject to announced and unannounced compliance reviews and audits by various external agencies  including the department of education  its office of inspector general  state licensing agencies  the applicable state approving agencies for financial assistance to veterans  and accrediting commissions 
as part of the department of education s ongoing monitoring of institutions administration of the title iv programs  the higher education act also requires institutions to annually submit to the department of education a title iv compliance audit conducted by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with applicable federal and department of education audit standards 
in addition  to enable the department of education to make a determination of an institution s financial responsibility  each institution must annually submit audited financial statements prepared in accordance with department of education regulations 
in july  the department of education initiated a program review of grand canyon university covering the and award years 
as part of this program review  a department of education program review team conducted a site visit on our campus and reviewed  and in some cases requested further information regarding  our records  practices and policies relating to  among other things  financial aid  enrollment  enrollment counselor compensation  program eligibility and other title iv compliance matters 
upon the conclusion of the site visit  we were informed by the program review team that it would i conduct further review of our documents and records offsite  ii upon completion of such review  schedule a formal exit interview to be followed by a preliminary program review report in which any preliminary findings of non compliance would be presented  and iii conclude the review by issuance of a final determination letter 
the program review team has not yet scheduled a formal exit interview with us 
accordingly  at this point  the program review remains open and we intend to continue to cooperate with the review team until the program review is completed 
while we have not yet received notification of the timing of our exit interview or the department of education s preliminary program review report or final determination letter  as a result of concerns first raised by a member of the program review team at the conclusion of the site visit and subsequently stated in an affidavit by such member filed in connection with the august hearing in our qui tam case  we became aware that the program review team had two preliminary findings of concern 
the first issue is whether a compensation policy in use during part of the period under review improperly rewarded some enrollment counselors based on success in enrolling students in violation of applicable law 
as we have previously disclosed in the context of our now settled qui tam action  while we believe that our compensation policies and practices are not based on success in enrolling students in violation of applicable law  the department of education s regulations and interpretations of the incentive compensation law do not establish clear criteria for compliance in all circumstances and some of our practices in prior years were not within the scope of any specific safe harbor provided in the compensation regulations 
the second issue is whether  during the award years under review  certain programs offered within our college of liberal arts provided students with training to prepare them for gainful employment in a recognized occupation 
this gainful employment standard has been a requirement for title iv eligibility for programs offered at proprietary institutions of higher education such as grand canyon university although  pursuant to legislation passed in and effective as of july   this requirement no longer applies to designated liberal arts programs offered by us and certain other institutions that have held accreditation by a regional accrediting agency since a date on or before october  we have held a regional accreditation since 
subsequent to the filing of the affidavit by the program review team member expressing this preliminary finding  the program review team submitted a written request to us in which the program review team stated the view that  prior to july   traditional liberal arts programs were not considered as being eligible under title iv but then requested additional information from us that would help the department of education determine whether the programs offered within our college of liberal arts were eligible under title iv because they did provide training to prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation 
while we were not informed as to which specific programs offered within our college of liberal arts the program review team believes may be ineligible  in august we provided the department of education with the requested information which we believe demonstrates that the programs offered within our college of liberal arts met this requirement 
we have received no further communications from the department of education regarding the program review 

table of contents our policies and procedures are planned and implemented to comply with the applicable standards and regulations under title iv 
if and to the extent the department of education s final determination letter identifies any compliance issues  we are committed to resolving such issues and ensuring that grand canyon university operates in compliance with all department of education requirements 
program reviews may remain unresolved for months or years with little or no communication from the department of education  and may involve multiple exchanges of information following the site visit 
we cannot presently predict whether or if further information requests will be made  when the exit interview will take place  when the preliminary program review report or final determination letter will be issued  or when the program review will be closed 
if the department of education were to make significant findings of non compliance in the final program review determination letter  including any finding related to the two issues discussed above  then  after exhausting any administrative appeals available to us  we could be required to pay a fine  return title iv monies previously received  or be subjected to other administrative sanctions  any of which outcomes could damage our reputation in the industry and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
privacy of student records 
the family educational rights and privacy act of  or ferpa  and the department of education s ferpa regulations require educational institutions to protect the privacy of students educational records by limiting an institution s disclosure of a student s personally identifiable information without the student s prior written consent 
ferpa also requires institutions to allow students to review and request changes to their educational records maintained by the institution  to notify students at least annually of this inspection right  and to maintain records in each student s file listing requests for access to and disclosures of personally identifiable information and the interest of such party in that information 
if an institution fails to comply with ferpa  the department of education may require corrective actions by the institution or may terminate an institution s receipt of further federal funds 
in addition  educational institutions are obligated to safeguard student information pursuant to the gramm leach bliley act  or glba  a federal law designed to protect consumers personal financial information held by financial institutions and other entities that provide financial services to consumers 
glba and the applicable glba regulations require an institution to  among other things  develop and maintain a comprehensive  written information security program designed to protect against the unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable financial information of students  parents  or other individuals with whom such institution has a customer relationship 
if an institution fails to comply with the applicable glba requirements  it may be required to take corrective actions  be subject to monitoring and oversight by the ftc  and be subject to fines or penalties imposed by the ftc 
for profit educational institutions are also subject to the general deceptive practices jurisdiction of the ftc with respect to their collection  use  and disclosure of student information 
the institution must also comply with the ftc red flags rule  a section of the federal fair credit reporting act  that requires the establishment of guidelines and policies regarding identity theft related to student credit accounts 
potential effect of regulatory violations 
if we fail to comply with the regulatory standards governing the title iv programs  the department of education could impose one or more sanctions  including transferring us to the reimbursement or cash monitoring system of payment  requiring us to repay title iv program funds  requiring us to post a letter of credit in favor of the department of education as a condition for continued title iv certification  taking emergency action against us  initiating proceedings to impose a fine or to limit  suspend  or terminate our participation in the title iv programs  or referring the matter for civil or criminal prosecution 
since we are provisionally certified to participate in the title iv programs on a month to month basis  the department of education could allow our certification to expire at the end of any month without advance notice and without any formal procedure for review of such action 
if such sanctions or proceedings were imposed against us and resulted in a substantial curtailment or termination of our participation in the title iv programs  our enrollments  revenues  and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
if we lost our eligibility to participate in the title iv programs  or if the amount of available title iv program funds was reduced  we would seek to arrange or provide alternative sources of revenue or financial aid for students 
we believe that one or more private organizations would be willing to provide financial assistance to our students  but there is no assurance that this would be the case 
the interest rate and other terms of such financial aid would likely not be as favorable as those for title iv program funds  and we might be required to guarantee all or part of such alternative assistance or might incur other additional costs in connection with securing such alternative assistance 
it is unlikely that we would be able to arrange alternative funding on any terms to replace all the title iv funding our students receive 
accordingly  our loss of eligibility to participate in the title iv programs  or a reduction in the amount of available title iv program funding for our students  would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  even if we could arrange or provide alternative sources of revenue or student financial aid 

table of contents in addition to the actions that may be brought against us as a result of our participation in the title iv programs  we are also subject to complaints and lawsuits relating to regulatory compliance brought not only by our regulatory agencies  but also by other government agencies and third parties  such as present or former students or employees and other members of the public 
new and pending regulations revised incentive compensation rule 
in the final rules issued by the department of education in respect of the incentive compensation rule and other program integrity issues described above  which will become effective on july   the safe harbors under the incentive compensation rule were eliminated as the department of education took the position that any commission  bonus or other incentive payment based in any part  directly or indirectly  on securing enrollments or awarding financial aid is inconsistent with the incentive payment prohibition in the higher education act 
the department of education contends that institutions do not need to rely on safe harbors to protect compensation that complies with the higher education act  and that institutions can readily determine if a payment or compensation is permissible under the higher education act by analyzing whether it is a commission  bonus or other incentive payment  defined as an award of a sum of money or something of value other than a fixed salary or wages  paid to or given to a person or entity for services rendered  and whether the commission  bonus or other incentive payment is provided to any person based in any part  directly or indirectly  upon success in securing enrollments or the award of financial aid  which are defined as activities engaged in for the purpose of the admission or matriculation of students for any period of time or the award of financial aid 
the department of education maintains that an institution can still make merit based adjustments to employee compensation  provided that such adjustments are not based in any part  directly or indirectly  upon success in securing enrollments or the award of financial aid 
accordingly  among other things  the department of education states that an institution may maintain a hierarchy of recruitment personnel with different levels of responsibility  with salary scales that reflect an added amount of responsibility  an institution may promote or demote recruitment personnel based on merit  and an institution may make a compensation decision based on seniority or length of employment  provided that in each case compensation decisions are consistent with the higher education act s prohibition on incentive compensation 
the final rules further clarify that this prohibition may extend to individuals holding a managerial position at any level of the company  to the extent that a particular individual has responsibility for recruitment or admission of students  or makes decisions about awarding title iv program funds 
the department of education states that an institution still would be able to make merit based adjustments to employee compensation  but would not be permitted to consider nor base compensation decisions directly or indirectly  in any part  on factors such as an employee s success in securing student enrollments  the award of financial aid or institutional goals based on that success 
while it is anticipated that the department of education may issue certain guidance on incentive compensation issues prior to july   we believe the changes imposed by the final rules  including the elimination of the safe harbors  increase the uncertainty about what constitutes incentive compensation and which employees are covered by the regulation 
in light of such uncertainty  we have changed some of our compensation practices for enrollment counselors and other employees  as well as the terms of our arrangements with certain third parties whom we pay for internet based services related to lead generation and marketing and whose activities are also subject to the incentive compensation rules 
the changes in these practices and arrangements could adversely affect our ability to compensate our enrollment counselors  other employees  and third parties in a manner that appropriately reflects their relative merit  which in turn could reduce their effectiveness and make it more difficult to attract and retain staff with the desired talent and motivation to succeed at grand canyon university 
in addition  this lack of certainty could increase the risk of future federal false claims act qui tam lawsuits in which private plaintiffs assert that our compensation practices violate the incentive compensation rules and  therefore  that our receipt of title iv funds constitutes a submission to the government of a false claim for payment 

table of contents misrepresentation 
the final rules on program integrity adopted october  and effective july  include provisions that strengthen the department of education s authority to sanction institutions for misrepresentations made by employees and certain third parties with which such institutions maintain service agreements such as for the provision of educational programs or marketing  advertising  recruiting or admissions services 
considering the breadth of this prohibition  it is possible that  despite our efforts to prevent such misrepresentations  our employees or service providers may make statements that could be construed as misrepresentations 
as a result  we may face complaints from students  prospective students and employees over statements made by us and our agents throughout the enrollment  admissions and financial aid process  as well as throughout attendance at grand canyon university  which would expose us to increased risk of litigation and enforcement action and applicable sanctions or other penalties up to and including termination of title iv eligibility 
state authorization 
states have the authority to assert jurisdiction  to the extent they so choose  over educational institutions offering online degree programs in a state but that otherwise have no physical location or other presence in that state 
the final program integrity rules adopted october  and effective july  include a provision that requires online providers to meet any such state requirements and  thus  the department of education would seem to have authority  in addition to that of the states  to enforce applicable state law requirements 
it is unclear how this rule will be enforced and what impact it will have on us 
in addition to arizona  we have determined that our activities in certain states constitute a presence requiring licensure or authorization under the requirements of the state education agency in those states  which we have obtained  while in other states we have determined that we are exempt under applicable state law from licensure or authorization requirements due to our regional accreditation or for other reasons 
in still other states  we have obtained approvals to operate as we have determined necessary in connection with our marketing and recruiting activities 
although we have a process for evaluating the compliance of our online educational programs with state requirements regarding distance and correspondence learning  and have experienced no significant restrictions on our educational activities to date as a result of such requirements  state regulatory requirements for online education vary among the states  are not well developed in many states  are imprecise or unclear in some states and are subject to change 
moreover  it is also unclear whether and to what extent state agencies may augment or change their regulations in this area as a result of these new department of education regulations and increased scrutiny 
if we fail to comply with licensing or authorization requirements for a particular state  or fail to obtain licenses or authorizations when required  we could lose our licensure or authorization from that state or be subject to other sanctions  including restrictions on our activities in that state  and fines and penalties  including department of education sanctions 
the loss of licensure or authorization in a state other than arizona could prohibit us from recruiting prospective students or offering educational services to current students in that state  which could significantly reduce our enrollments 
approval of new programs 
the final program integrity rules adopted october  and effective july  include provisions regarding the approval of new programs 
although the final rules relaxed the program approval standard originally proposed  the rules still impose various new requirements on  and could adversely affect  our ability to add new academic programs 
in addition  the department of education has published no definite standards by which schools can determine the likelihood that any program will be approved 
as such  we believe this rule adds uncertainty regarding new program approval  which could adversely affect our ability to respond to emerging employment trends and add programs that are responsive to those trends  which in turn could decrease our attractiveness to certain students 
in addition  a lack of certainty could increase the risk of future federal false claims act qui tam lawsuits in which private plaintiffs assert that students improperly received title iv aid while attending a program that has not been approved 
additional final rules 
in addition to the program integrity issues specifically addressed above  the final rules issued by department of education on october  and effective july  include provisions regarding the definition of a credit hour  written agreements between institutions  particularly institutions under common ownership or control  the administration of ability to benefit examinations  requirements regarding an institution s return of title iv program funds  and certain other issues pertaining to a student s eligibility to receive title iv program funds 
we are in the process of reviewing all of the final rules 
we cannot predict how the recently released or any other resulting regulations will be interpreted  and therefore whether we will be able to comply with these requirements by the effective date 
insufficient time  or lack of sufficient guidance  for compliance with the final rules  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
uncertainty surrounding the application of the final rules  interpretive regulations  and guidance from department of education may continue for some period of time and could reduce our enrollment  increase our cost of doing business  and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents proposed gainful employment rule 
under the higher education act  proprietary schools are eligible to participate in title iv programs in respect of educational programs that lead to gainful employment in a recognized occupation  with the limited exception of qualified programs leading to a bachelor s degree in liberal arts 
historically  this concept has not been defined in detail 
the proposed definition of gainful employment in the july  nprm described above would take into consideration whether former students are repaying their federal student loans and the relationship between total student loan debt and average earnings after completing a postsecondary program 
as proposed in the nprm  individual educational programs would be divided into three groups based on the proposed metrics programs with at least of their former students paying down the principal on their federal loans  or with graduates having a debt to earnings ratio of less than of discretionary income or of total income  would be deemed fully eligible for title iv funding 
these programs would be required to disclose both their repayment rates and debt to earnings ratios unless they pass both of the preceding tests 
programs with less than of their former students paying down the principal on their federal loans  and with graduates having a debt to earnings ratio above of discretionary income and of total income  would be deemed ineligible for title iv funding 
such programs would have lost title iv eligibility as of july   although institutions would have been required to warn students in the programs about the high debt to earnings ratio effective july  in order to mitigate against large and immediate displacements of students as of the july  deadline  the department of education further proposed that no more than of a single institution s programs would be declared ineligible as of that date  with the lowest performing programs immediately losing eligibility and the remaining non compliant programs losing eligibility one year later 
programs that are not fully eligible or ineligible under the above standards would be restricted programs and subject to limits on enrollment growth 
such institutions also would be required to demonstrate employer support for the program and warn consumers and current students of high debt levels 
due to the unprecedented volume of comments received to the gainful employment nprm  on september   the department of education announced that it would delay issuing final rules regarding the gainful employment standard until early in order to give interested parties more time to clarify their comments and respond to questions from department of education officials 
while there remain many open questions and interpretive issues with respect to this gainful employment nprm  including when it will go into effect and questions as to the availability of  and the ability of education companies to obtain  the information needed to calculate the applicable metrics  if this regulation is adopted in a form similar to the department of education s proposal in the nprm  it could render some of our programs ineligible for title iv funding if we do not meet the test to be considered fully eligible 
in addition  the continuing eligibility of our educational programs for title iv funding would be at risk due to factors beyond our control  such as changes in the income level of persons employed in specific occupations or sectors  increases in interest rates  changes in student mix to persons requiring higher amounts of student loans to complete their programs  changes in student loan delinquency rates and other factors 
if a particular program ceased to be eligible for title iv funding  in most cases it would not be practical to continue offering that course under our current business model 
regulations in the form proposed in the nprm could result in a significant realignment of the types of educational programs that are offered by us and by proprietary institutions in general  in order to comply with the rules or to avoid the uncertainty associated with compliance over time 
furthermore  we may be required for certain programs to warn consumers and current students of high debt levels and provide the most recent debt measures for the program 
such changes in our business practices could reduce our enrollment  perhaps materially  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations and could adversely affect our stock price 

table of contents regulatory standards that may restrict institutional expansion or other changes many actions that we may wish to take in connection with expanding our operations or other changes are subject to review or approval by the applicable regulatory agencies 
in addition to those matters described in detail below  most state education agencies impose regulatory requirements on educational institutions operating within their boundaries 
see state educational licensure and authorization and new and pending regulations state authorization 
adding teaching locations  implementing new educational programs  and increasing enrollment 
the requirements and standards of state education agencies  accrediting commissions  and the department of education limit our ability in certain instances to establish additional teaching locations  implement new educational programs  or increase enrollment in certain programs 
many states require review and approval before institutions can add new locations or programs  and arizona also limits the number of undergraduate nursing students we may enroll which represents a small portion of our overall nursing program 
the arizona state board for private postsecondary education  the higher learning commission  and other state education agencies and specialized accrediting commissions that authorize or accredit us and our programs generally require institutions to notify them in advance of adding new locations or implementing new programs  and upon notification may undertake a review of the quality of the facility or the program and the financial  academic  and other qualifications of the institution 
with respect to the department of education  if an institution participating in the title iv programs plans to add a new location or educational program  the institution must generally apply to the department of education to have the additional location or educational program designated as within the scope of the institution s title iv eligibility 
historically  a degree granting institution such as us was not required to obtain the department of education s approval of additional programs that lead to an associate  bachelor s  professional  or graduate degree at the same degree level as programs previously approved by the department of education  and  similarly  an institution was not required to obtain advance approval for new programs that prepare students for gainful employment in the same or a related recognized occupation as an educational program that has previously been designated by the department of education as an eligible program at that institution if it meets certain minimum length requirements 
however  as a condition for an institution to participate in the title iv programs on a provisional basis  the department of education can require prior approval of such programs or otherwise restrict the number of programs an institution may add or the extent to which an institution can modify existing educational programs 
if an institution that is required to obtain the department of education s advance approval for the addition of a new program or new location fails to do so  the institution may be liable for repayment of the title iv program funds received by the institution or students in connection with that program or enrolled at that location 
in addition  as part of the final rules adopted by the department of education on october  and effective july   the department of education issued final regulations imposing new requirements with respect to the approval of new programs 
see new and pending regulations approval of new programs 
acquiring other schools 
while we have not acquired any other schools in the past  we may seek to do so in the future 
the department of education and virtually all state education agencies and accrediting commissions require a company to seek their approval if it wishes to acquire another school 
in our case  we would need to obtain the approval of the arizona state board for private postsecondary education or other state education agency that licenses the school being acquired  the higher learning commission  any other accrediting commission that accredits the school being acquired  and the department of education 
the level of review varies by individual state and accrediting commission  with some requiring approval of such an acquisition before it occurs while others only consider approval after the acquisition has occurred 
the higher learning commission would require us to obtain its advance approval of such an acquisition 
the approval of the applicable state education agencies and accrediting commissions is a necessary prerequisite to the department of education certifying the acquired school to participate in the title iv programs under our ownership 
the restrictions imposed by any of the applicable regulatory agencies could delay or prevent our acquisition of other schools in some circumstances 
provisional certification 
each institution must apply to the department of education for continued certification to participate in the title iv programs at least every six years  or when it undergoes a change in control  and an institution may come under the department of education s review when it expands its activities in certain ways  such as opening an additional location  adding an educational program  or modifying the academic credentials that it offers 

table of contents the department of education may place an institution on provisional certification status if it finds that the institution does not fully satisfy all of the eligibility and certification standards 
in addition  if a company acquires a school from another entity  the acquired school will automatically be placed on provisional certification when the department of education approves the transaction 
during the period of provisional certification  the institution must comply with any additional conditions or restrictions included in its program participation agreement with the department of education 
if the department of education finds that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement  it may seek to revoke the institution s certification to participate in the title iv programs without advance notice or advance opportunity for the institution to challenge that action 
in addition  the department of education may more closely review an institution that is provisionally certified if it applies for recertification or approval to open a new location  add an educational program  acquire another school  or make any other significant change 
students attending provisionally certified institutions remain eligible to receive title iv program funds 
we are currently provisionally certified to participate in the title iv programs on a month to month basis 
the department of education issued our current program participation agreement in may  after an extended review following the change in control that occurred in february the department of education s recertification imposed certain conditions on us  including a requirement that we post a letter of credit  accept restrictions on the growth of our program offerings and enrollment  and receive title iv funds under the heightened cash monitoring system of payment rather than by advance payment 
in october  the department of education eliminated the letter of credit requirement and allowed the growth restrictions to expire  and in august  it eliminated the heightened cash monitoring restrictions and returned us to the advance payment method 
we submitted our application for recertification in march in anticipation of the expiration of our provisional certification on june  the department of education did not make a decision on our recertification application by june  and therefore our provisional certification to participate in the title iv programs has been automatically extended on a month to month basis until the department of education makes its decision 
since june  we have filed updates with the department of education and communicated with department of education personnel in order to update our pending recertification application with relevant information  such as our status as a publicly traded corporation after the initial public offering  the identity of the members of our board of directors  and the termination of the voting agreements in january there can be no assurance that the department of education will recertify us or that it will not impose restrictions as a condition of approving our pending recertification application or with respect to any future recertification 
change in ownership resulting in a change in control 
the department of education  as well as many accrediting commissions and states  require institutions of higher education to report or obtain approval of certain changes in control and changes in other aspects of institutional organization or control 
with respect to publicly traded corporations  like us  department of education regulations provide that a change in control occurs if  among other things  the corporation has a stockholder that owns  or has voting control over  at least of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and is the largest stockholder of the corporation defined in the regulations as a controlling shareholder  and that controlling shareholder ceases to own  or have voting control over  at least of such stock or ceases to be the largest stockholder 
under department of education regulations  an institution that undergoes a change in control as defined by the department of education loses its eligibility to participate in the title iv programs and must apply to the department of education in order to reestablish such eligibility 
since may  we have been certified to participate in title iv programs on a provisional basis 
we submitted our application for recertification in march in anticipation of the expiration of our provisional certification on june  the department of education did not make a decision on our recertification application by june   and therefore our provisional certification to participate in the title iv programs has been automatically extended since that time on a month to month basis until the department of education makes its decision 
for a school that is certified on a provisional basis  the department of education may revoke the institution s certification without advance notice or advance opportunity for the institution to challenge that action 
for a school that is provisionally certified on a month to month basis  like we are  the department of education may allow the institution s certification to expire at the end of any month without advance notice  and without any formal procedure for review of such action 
to our knowledge  such action is very rare and has only occurred upon a determination that an institution is in substantial violation of material title iv requirements 

table of contents in connection with our initial public offering in november and our secondary offering in september  brent d 
richardson  our executive chairman  and christopher c 
richardson  our general counsel and a director collectively  the richardson voting group  had entered into voting agreements with certain stockholders 
pursuant to these agreements  certain of our stockholders granted to the richardson voting group a five year irrevocable proxy to exercise voting authority with respect to certain shares of our common stock held by such persons  for so long as such shares are held by such persons 
the voting agreements do not apply to any shares held by any such person that are transferred in open market or other transactions 
the number of shares over which the richardson voting group continues to hold voting power will decrease over time as shares held by other parties to the voting agreement are sold  which sales we may be not be aware of since many of the shares held by such other parties are held in street name 
pursuant to these agreements  however  following each offering and through january   the richardson voting group continued to control the voting power of more than of our total outstanding voting stock 
to avoid an unplanned change in control from occurring and to allow the richardsons and other stockholders party to the agreements flexibility to sell shares without causing an unplanned change in control  we submitted a notice to the department of education informing it of the richardson voting group s intention to terminate the voting agreements  which would trigger a change in control because it would cause the richardson voting group to own and control less than of our outstanding voting stock  and requesting that the department of education review such proposed terminations and advise us as to the effect of such terminations on our eligibility to participate in the title iv programs  particularly in light of our pending application for recertification discussed below 
in december  the department of education responded to our request in writing and informed us that  consistent with department of education regulations  if we notified the department of education of the change in control and filed a timely and materially complete application within ten business days after the change in control occurred  the department of education may temporarily certify us on a provisional basis following the change in control  so that our students would retain access to title iv program funds until the department of education completed its full review 
in addition  the department of education informed us that it may extend our temporary provisional certification if we timely filed other required materials by the last day of the month following the month in which the change in control occurred  including any approval of the change in control by the higher learning commission our accrediting commission and the arizona state board for private postsecondary education our state licensing agency  as required  and certain required financial information consisting of our recent sec filings showing our financial condition 
the department of education s letter did not indicate any intention to impose any conditions such as any letter of credit requirement or other restrictions on us as a result of the change in control 
accordingly  following receipt of the department of education s letter  the approval of the higher learning commission to terminate the voting agreements and confirmation from the arizona state board for private postsecondary education that terminating the voting agreements would not be considered a change in control  the richardson voting group terminated the voting agreements effective january  on that same day  we filed our complete application and all other required information with the department of education 
following the completion of the department of education s review of the information that we have provided in connection with the termination of the voting agreements  it would normally certify us on a provisional basis for a period of up to approximately three years 
the precise conditions and restrictions  if any  and duration of any provisional certification granted in this circumstance  however  are difficult to predict because we already are  and have been for an extended period  provisionally certified on a month to month basis 
we do not believe that our continued provisional certification on a month to month basis  following the change in control or otherwise  has had or will have any material impact on our day to day operations 
however  there can be no assurance that the department of education will recertify us or that it will not impose conditions or other restrictions on us as a condition of granting us provisional certification following the change in control or approving our pending recertification application or with respect to any future recertification 
if the department of education does not renew or withdraws our certification to participate in the title iv programs at any time  our students would no longer be able to receive title iv program funds 
similarly  the department of education could renew our certification  but restrict or delay our students receipt of title iv funds  limit the number of students to whom we could disburse such funds  or place other restrictions on us 
any of these outcomes would have a material adverse effect on our enrollments and us 

table of contents the higher learning commission provides that an institution must obtain its approval in advance of a change in ownership  corporate control or structure in order for the institution to retain its accredited status 
in june  the higher learning commission adopted new policies and standards for the review of transactions that may constitute such a change in control 
one standard provides that a transaction may be considered a change in control if an individual  entity or group increases or decreases its control of shares to greater than or less than of the total outstanding shares of the stock of a parent corporation that owns or controls the accredited institution 
in addition  in the event of a change in control  the higher learning commission requires the institution to obtain its approval in advance of the change  and in certain circumstances that process may require several weeks or several months or more to complete 
in addition  following a change in control  the higher learning commission will conduct an onsite evaluation within six months in order to continue the institution s accreditation 
as noted above  we informed the higher learning commission of the richardson voting group s intent to terminate the voting agreements and or endeavour capital fund iv  lp and its affiliates intent to sell shares that  in either case  would cause the richardson voting group to own and control less than of our outstanding voting stock 
the higher learning commission has informed us that such event may occur  provided that we provide an update to the higher learning commission confirming the facts of the termination or other transaction  identifying investors who continue to hold or more of our outstanding voting stock  and explaining the impact thereof  if any  on us and our board of directors 
many states include the sale of a controlling interest of common stock in the definition of a change in control requiring approval  but their thresholds for determining a change in control vary widely 
the standards of the arizona state board for private postsecondary education provide that an institution that is owned by a publicly traded company whose control is vested in the voting members of the board of directors  such as grand canyon education  undergoes a change in control if or more of the voting members of the board of directors change within a month period or the chief executive officer of the corporation changes 
a change in control under the definition of one of the other state agencies that regulate us might require us to obtain approval of a change in control in order to maintain our authorization to operate in that state  and in some cases such states could require us to obtain advance approval of the change in control 
if we were to undergo a change in control under the standards of the arizona state board of private postsecondary education at any time in the future  we would be required to file an application with the arizona state board for private postsecondary education in order to obtain approval for such change in control 
we cannot predict whether the arizona state board for private postsecondary education would impose any limitations or conditions on us  or identify any compliance issues related to us in the context of the change in control process  that could result in our loss of authorization in arizona 
any such loss would result in our loss of eligibility to participate in the title iv programs which would cause a significant decline in our student enrollments 
as noted above  we informed the arizona state board of private postsecondary education of the richardson voting group s intent to terminate the voting agreements and or endeavour capital fund iv  lp and its affiliates intent to sell shares that  in either case  would cause the richardson voting group to own and control less than of our outstanding voting stock 
the arizona state board of private postsecondary education has informed us that it does not consider such event to be a change of control under its standards
