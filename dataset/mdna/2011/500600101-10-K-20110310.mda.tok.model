item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including the risks discussed in item a 
risk factors  and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition under the percentage of completion method  bad debts  inventories  warranty reserves  investment valuations  valuation of stock compensation awards  recoverability of deferred tax assets  liabilities for uncertain tax positions and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are most affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue if four basic criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and services rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we do not recognize revenue for products prior to customer acceptance unless we believe the product meets all customer specifications and has a history of consistently achieving customer acceptance of the product 
provisions for product returns and allowances are recorded in the same period as the related revenues 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of product when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and other allowances 
certain product sales are made to distributors under agreements allowing for a limited right of return on unsold products 
sales to distributors are primarily made for sales to the distributors customers and not for stocking of inventory 
we delay revenue recognition for our estimate of distributor claims of right of return on unsold products based upon our historical experience with our products and specific analysis of amounts subject to return based upon discussions with our distributors or their customers 
we recognize revenues from long term research and development contracts on the percentage of completion method of accounting as work is performed  based upon the ratio of costs or hours already incurred to the estimated total cost of completion or hours of work to be performed 
revenue recognized at any point in time is limited to the amount funded by the us government or contracting entity 
we account for product development and research contracts that have established prices for distinct phases as if each phase were a separate contract 
in some instances  we are contracted to create a deliverable which is anticipated to go into full production 
in those cases  we discontinue the percentage of completion method after formal qualification of the deliverable has been completed and revenue is then recognized based on the criteria established for sale of products 
in certain instances qualification may be achieved and delivery of production units may commence however our customer may have either identified new issues to be resolved or wish to incorporate a newer display technology 
in these circumstances new units delivered will continue to be accounted for under the criteria established for sale of products 
we classify amounts earned on contracts in progress that are in excess of amounts billed as unbilled receivables and we classify amounts received in excess of amounts earned as billings in excess of revenues 
table of contents earned 
we invoice based on dates specified in the related agreement or in periodic installments based upon our invoicing cycle 
we recognize the entire amount of an estimated ultimate loss in our financial statements at the time the loss on a contract becomes known 
accounting for design  development and production contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract revenues and costs  and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
due to the size and nature of the work required to be performed on many of our contracts  the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
contract costs include material  labor and subcontracting costs  as well as an allocation of indirect costs 
we have to make assumptions regarding the number of labor hours required to complete a task  the complexity of the work to be performed  the availability and cost of materials  and performance by our subcontractors 
for contract change orders  claims or similar items  we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
we have accounting policies in place to address these as well as other contractual and business arrangements to properly account for long term contracts 
if our estimate of total contract costs or our determination of whether the customer agrees that a milestone is achieved is incorrect  our revenue could be overstated and profits would be negatively impacted 
bad debt we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this estimate is based on an analysis of specific customer creditworthiness and historical bad debts experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make future payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory we provide a reserve for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventory based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions and our production plans 
inventories that are obsolete or slow moving are generally fully reserved representing the estimated net realizable value as such information becomes available 
our iii v products are made to each customer s unique specifications and are generally produced upon receipt of a customer order 
the manufacturing time to make our iii v products is less than one day  accordingly our iii v inventory consists primarily of raw material  primarily gallium arsenide wafers  or finished products 
the finished product may be at our facilities or at our customer s facilities under consignment programs 
our display products are manufactured based upon production plans whose critical assumptions include non binding demand forecasts provided by our customers  lead times for raw materials  lead times for wafer foundries to perform circuit processing and yields 
if a customer were to cancel an order or actual demand was lower than forecasted demand  we could not sell the excess iii v inventory and we may not be able to sell the excess display inventory and additional reserves would be required 
if we were unable to sell the excess inventory  we would establish reserves to reduce the inventory to its estimated realizable value generally zero 
investment valuation at december  we held a minority investment in advance wireless semiconductor company awsc  a publicly traded company whose share price has been  and may continue to be  highly volatile 
we consider this investment to be available for sale and accordingly account for fluctuations in the value of this investment in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the fair market value of awsc was million at december  we periodically make equity investments in private companies  accounted for on the cost or equity method  whose values are difficult to determine 
when assessing investments in private companies for an other than temporary decline in value  we consider such factors as  among other things  the share price from the investee s 
table of contents latest financing round  the performance of the investee in relation to its own operating targets and its business plan  the investee s revenue and cost trends  the liquidity and cash position  including its cash burn rate and market acceptance of the investee s products and services 
because these are private companies which we do not control we may not be able to obtain all of the information we would want in order to make a complete assessment of the investment on a timely basis 
accordingly  our estimates may be revised if other information becomes available at a later date 
in addition to the above we make investments in government and agency backed securities and corporate debt securities 
for all of our investments we provide for an impairment valuation if we believe a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary  which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
the determination of whether a decline in value is other than temporary requires that we estimate the cash flows we expect to receive from the security 
we use publicly available information such as credit ratings and financial information of the entity that issued the security in the development of our expectation of the cash flows to be received 
historically  we have periodically recorded other than temporary impairment losses 
product warranty we generally sell products with a limited warranty of product quality and a limited indemnification of customers against intellectual property infringement claims related to our products 
we accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
as of december   we had a warranty reserve of million  which represents the estimated liabilities for warranty claims in process  potential warranty issues customers have notified us about and an estimate based on historical failure rates 
for the fiscal years  and  our warranty claims and reversals were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
if our estimates for warranty claims are incorrect  our profits would be impacted 
income taxes we have historically incurred domestic operating losses from both a financial reporting and tax return standpoint 
we establish valuation allowances if it appears more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
these judgments are based on our projections of taxable income and the amount and timing of our tax operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
given our federal operating tax loss carryforwards  we do not expect to pay domestic federal taxes in the near term 
it is possible that we could pay domestic alternative minimum taxes and state income taxes 
we are also subject to foreign taxes from our korean and taiwanese subsidiary operations 
our income tax provision is based on calculations and assumptions that will be subject to examination by tax authorities 
despite our history of operating losses there can be exposures for state taxes  federal alternative minimum taxes or foreign tax that may be due 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
should the actual results differ from our estimates  we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
such adjustment could have a material impact on our results of operations 
we have historically established valuation allowances against all of our net deferred tax assets because of our history of generating operating losses and restrictions on the use of certain items 
our evaluation of the recoverability of deferred tax assets has also included analysis of the expiration dates of net operating loss carryforwards 
in forming our conclusions as to whether the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized we consider the sources of its income and the projected stability of those sources and product life cycles 
over the last three fiscal years a significant component of our income has been derived from sales of higher margin military products to the us government 
if the us government significantly reduces funding for these programs we will not be profitable 
in assessing our ability to realize our domestic deferred tax assets in the future  we consider the potential impact of the us government s federal budget deficit on both the us military programs in which we currently participate and those programs in which we anticipate participating in the future 
a similar analysis is performed with respect to our foreign subsidiaries 

table of contents stock compensation there were no stock options granted in fiscal years  or the fair value of nonvested restricted common stock awards is generally the market value of the company s equity shares on the date of grant 
the nonvested common stock awards require the employee to fulfill certain obligations  including remaining employed by the company for one  two or four years the vesting period and in certain cases meeting performance criteria 
the performance criteria primarily consist of the achievement of the company s annual incentive plan goals 
for nonvested restricted common stock awards which solely require the recipient to remain employed with the company  the stock compensation expense is amortized over the anticipated service period 
for nonvested restricted common stock awards which require the achievement of performance criteria  the company reviews the probability of achieving the performance goals on a periodic basis 
if the company determines that it is probable that the performance criteria will be achieved  the amount of compensation cost derived for the performance goal is amortized over the service period 
if the performance criteria are not met  no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed 
the company recognizes compensation costs on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for time vested awards 
for awards that vest based on performance conditions  the company uses the accelerated model for graded vesting awards 
results of operations we are a leading developer and manufacturer of advanced semiconductor materials and miniature displays 
we use our proprietary semiconductor material technology to design  manufacture and market our iii v and cyberdisplay products for use in highly demanding commercial wireless communications and high resolution portable consumer electronic applications 
our products enable our customers to develop and market an improved generation of products for these target applications 
we have two principal sources of revenues product revenues and research and development revenues 
product revenues consist of sales of our iii v products  principally gallium arsenide gaas hbt transistor wafers  and cyberdisplay products 
research and development revenues consist primarily of development contracts with agencies or prime contractors of the us government 
research and development revenues were million  or of total revenues  million  or of total revenues and million  or of total revenues in kowon  our korean subsidiary and one of our reportable segments  provides to us back end packaging services related to our cyberdisplay products as well as selling displays to other customers 
kopin taiwan corporation  our taiwanese subsidiary and one of our reportable segments  in conjunction with our two domestic facilities  manufactures our iii v products 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
our revenues  which include product sales and amounts earned from research and development contracts  for fiscal years and were as follows in millions revenues iii v cyberdisplay total the increase in our iii v revenues resulted from an increase in demand for our products  specifically hbt transistors  from customers that use our products in the production of components sold to makers of wireless handsets 
we believe this increase in demand was the result of both an increase in the number of wireless handsets that were sold over the prior year and because the percentage of g or smartphones  which is a 
table of contents more technologically advanced type of wireless handset  increased over the prior year as a percentage of the total wireless handsets sold 
g and smart phones offer more functions  for example web browsing  than a standard wireless handset 
g and smart phones require more hbt transistors than a standard wireless handset to support the increased functionality 
we believe the increase in industry sales of g and smart phones will continue in in july our purchase and supply agreement with our largest iii v customer  a customer which represented of our revenues expires see item a  risk factors for explanation of percent of revenue calculation  subject to a last time buy option 
if we do not renew this agreement or increase hbt sales to other customers our sales may decline 
display revenues for and were as follows display revenues by category in millions military applications consumer electronic applications eyewear applications research development total sales of our products for military applications declined in because of reduced demand from the us government 
the us government is projected to incur large budget deficits for the near future and is expected to reduce spending on military programs as part of the solution to decrease these deficits 
as a result of this anticipated reduction in military spending demand for our military products may decline 
our military products have higher profit margins than our other display products 
the increase in the consumer electronic applications category is the result of an increase in sales of our products for digital still cameras 
our ability to forecast our revenues in this category is very difficult as sales of our product ultimately depend on how successful our customers are in promoting their digital still cameras models 
there are many digital still camera models offered by a number of large consumer electronic companies and it is a very competitive product category 
the customers for our eyewear products tend to be smaller companies and the economic down turn in and affected their ability to obtain credit with which to purchase our products 
the increase in sale of our products in to customers that use them for eyewear products is the result of a few of these customers being able to obtain financing in we believe that some of the increase is from these customers refilling their inventory as well as for meeting current demand 
the decline in research and development revenues is the result of a decline in funding from the us government 
we believe the amount of funding for research and development which is funded by the us government may decline as it addresses its fiscal deficit issues 
in we anticipate offering a head worn  hands free cloud computing product that has an optical pod with a microdisplay 
we do not believe revenue will be significant in from sales of these products but we do believe in successive years products such as this will be important for our revenue growth and ability to maintain profitability 
this is the first product that we have developed that has a significant software component 
we anticipate a business model whereby we will sell the optical pod and license the software 
we have been the sole supplier of displays to the us military for its thermal weapon sight programs  tws  tws ii and currently tws bridge 
we believe the us military will evaluate competitors products for the next thermal weapon sight program  tws iii 
this could result in our receiving a lower percentage of these total programs than we historically have 
there are a number of different display technologies which can produce displays in small form factors 
we believe one of the benefits of our display technology is the ability to produce high resolution displays in small form factors 
the digital still camera market is mature and the majority of these devices use low resolution display products which results in our having limited  if any  competitive advantage over our competitors and  therefore  the ability to sell displays into these markets is very price dependent 

table of contents accordingly for us to maintain or increase display revenues with above average gross margins  we will need to increase sales to customers who buy our higher resolution display products  such as the military  or develop new categories  such as eyewear 
we also anticipate  based on current discussions with our customers and certain contractual obligations that the prices of certain of our products will decline in fiscal year we anticipate the average selling price of our hbt transistor wafers and display products sold to customers for consumer electronics applications will decline approximately during fiscal year relative to we expect sales prices of our display products for military applications to remain relatively flat for as compared to the overall increase or decrease in the average sales price of our display products will be dependent on the sales mix of commercial and military display sales 
we expect revenue of between million and million for fiscal year  however  due to the current worldwide economic situation our ability to forecast revenues and results of operations is very limited 
our forecasts are based on our discussions with customers and our expectations about the future global economy and are not based on firm non cancellable orders 
international sales represented and of product revenues for fiscal years and respectively 
the increase in international sales is primarily attributable to an increase in sales of our cyberdisplay products for digital still cameras and iii v products to customers who sell components to manufacturers of wireless handsets 
we expect our revenues will primarily be from customers located in the us international sales are primarily sales of cyberdisplay products to consumer electronic manufacturers located in japan  korea and china 
our international sales are primarily denominated in us currency 
consequently  a strengthening of the us dollar could increase the price in local currencies of our products in foreign markets and make our products relatively more expensive than competitors products that are denominated in local currencies  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in those foreign markets 
in addition  sales of our cyberdisplay products in korea are transacted through our korean subsidiary  kowon technology co  ltd 
kowon s sales are primarily denominated in us dollars 
however  kowon s local operating costs are primarily denominated in korean won 
kowon also holds us dollars in order to pay various expenses 
as a result  our financial position and results of operations are subject to exchange rate fluctuation in transactional and functional currency 
we have not taken any protective measures against exchange rate fluctuations  such as purchasing hedging instruments with respect to such fluctuations  because of the historically stable exchange rate between the japanese yen  korean won and the us dollar 
cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues in millions cost of product revenues as a of revenues cost of product revenues  which is comprised of materials  labor and manufacturing overhead related to the production of our products remained relatively consistent from to as a percentage of revenues 
our gross margin is affected by increases or decreases in the sales prices of our products  changes in raw material prices  unit volume of sales  manufacturing efficiencies and the mix of products sold 
as discussed above our sales prices historically decline on an annual basis 
our overhead costs and  to a lesser extent  our labor costs are normally stable and do not fluctuate significantly during any twelve month period 
essentially  we consider labor and overhead costs to be fixed in nature over the short term and therefore profitability is very dependent on the sales prices of our products and the volume of sales 
gross margins  as a percentage of sales  remained relatively consistent from to because the gross margins as a percent of sales for our iii v products increased which offset the reduced gross margin contribution resulting from the decline in military display product sales 
the gross margins on our iii v products increased because of the increase in unit volume of sales 
essentially the 
table of contents fixed cost per unit declined as we produced more units for approximately the same infrastructure cost as the prior year 
for we anticipate sale prices of display products for military applications to remain stable and sales prices of our iii v products for wireless handset applications and our displays products for consumer electronic applications to decline 
as a result  in order for us to increase gross margins we need to increase manufacturing efficiencies and or increase the unit volume of sales 
research and development 
research and development r d expenses are incurred in support of internal display and iii v product development programs or programs funded by agencies or prime contractors of the us government and commercial partners 
r d revenues associated with funded programs are presented separately in revenue in the statement of operations 
research and development costs include staffing  purchases of materials and laboratory supplies  circuit design costs  fabrication and packaging of display products  and overhead 
for fiscal years and r d expense was as follows in millions research and development expense funded internal total r d expense increased in as compared to the prior year primarily because of increases in costs to develop iii v products for use in g and smartphones and a new head worn hands free cloud computing display product 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses consist of the expenses incurred by our sales and marketing personnel and related expenses  and administrative and general corporate expenses 
selling  general and administrative expense in millions selling  general and administrative expense as a of revenues the increase in s  g a expenses in as compared to is attributable to an increase in investor relations expense of million  insurance expense of million  labor expense of million and bad debts of million partially offset by a reduction in professional fees of million 
the decrease in bad debts expense was not a true increase per se but rather in there was a credit in bad debt expense as a result of a reversal of million allowance for doubtful accounts established at december  for the possible uncollectible receivables from ktc 
this allowance was reversed when we acquired control of ktc in the third quarter of the reduction in professional fees was the result of insurance proceeds which reimbursed the company for expenses previously incurred in dealing with certain legal actions 
in april  december and april  the compensation committee of the company approved the issuance of   and  respectively  of restricted stock awards to certain of our employees 
we issue restricted stock awards either as part of our annual incentive plan incentive equity awards or to induce a prospective employee to join us or current employee to remain with us for at least a certain period of time retention equity awards 
the number of shares of our common stock that an employee will ultimately receive and the compensation expense that we will ultimately recognize under an incentive equity award is based on achieving certain financial milestones and remaining with the company for a specific period of time 
in the case of retention equity awards shares earned are solely a function of time employed 
we filed a proxy statement on march  describing our equity incentive plan  and we have also filed on behalf of certain officers and directors form s with the securities and exchange commission which detail the conditions under our officers can earn the restricted stock awards 
the proxy statement and form s are available on our website www 
kopin 
com 
in december the compensation committee approved the issuance of  restricted 
table of contents stock awards to our employees  subject to certain conditions 
these conditions were essentially the same conditions for the awards made in in addition  as part of its board of director compensation in fiscal years and we issued  shares of restricted stock to our board members representing the annual grants for fiscal years and the equity awards to the board of directors vest per year over the four years following the grant 
in connection with the issuance of the awards above  and the amortization of awards issued before fiscal year  we recorded stock compensation expenses of million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
other income and expense 
in millions interest income other income and expense  net foreign currency transaction losses gains other than temporary impairment of marketable debt securities subtotal gain on sales of investments gain on loans to ktc gain on remeasurement of investment in ktc gain on sales of patents other income and expense other income and expense  net  as shown above  is composed of interest income  foreign currency transaction and remeasurement gains and losses incurred by our korean and taiwanese subsidiaries  other than temporary impairment on marketable debt securities  gains resulting from our obtaining a controlling interest in ktc and license fees 
for  we recorded million of foreign currency losses as compared to million of foreign currency losses for this was primarily attributable to decreased fluctuations in the us dollar and korean won currency exchange rate 
other income and expense  net for also includes expense of million to record an impairment of certain marketable debt securities which were deemed other than temporarily impaired 
as announced in our earnings released on march  and as filed in the current report on form k  our income from operations was million 
subsequent to the release we reclassified million from other income and expense  net  to income from operations 
as our marketable debt securities have matured we have been reinvesting in securities which  due to current interest rates  have lower yields than the securities which matured  accordingly we anticipate that our interest income will decline in in conjunction with our obtaining a controlling interest in ktc in we recorded a gain of million for the remeasurement of our investment in ktc to fair market value and million related to the repayment of loans from ktc which had been previously written off 
in we loaned ktc million and due to their liquidity problems  we subsequently recorded in both million of equity losses in ktc and a loan loss reserve of million 
a more complete explanation of the impact on our financial statements from our obtaining a controlling interest in ktc is below 
in fiscal year we entered into an agreement to sell certain patents which we were not using and that had a carrying value of to a buyer who would attempt to sublicense the patents 
the total consideration the company would receive for the sale of the patents would be a percentage of any sublicense fees  after expenses  
table of contents the buyer received 
in we recorded million of income which represented the company s share of sublicense fees income 
we do not expect to receive any material additional amounts from the sales of these patents 
in we sold certain additional patents we were no longer using for million 
there is no additional consideration to be received for the patents sold in we continue to evaluate the patents in our portfolio for opportunities to monetize these assets 
equity earnings losses in unconsolidated affiliates 
our equity earnings losses in unconsolidated affiliates consists of our approximate share of the losses of kobrite totaling million in and million in  offset by the effects of the repayment of a loan by ktc which is discussed in more detail below  in of million 
tax provision benefit 
the provision for income taxes for the fiscal years ended and represent alternative minimum taxes owed to us federal and state taxing authorities of million and million  respectively 
for we expect to have taxes based on us federal tax liabilities based on alternative minimum tax rules and on our foreign operations 
we also expect to have a state tax provision for financial reporting purposes in net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest 
we own approximately of the equity of kowon technology co 
ltd 
kowon and of the equity of ktc 
net loss income attributable to the noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statement of operations represents the portion of the results of operations of kowon and ktc which are allocated to the shareholders of the approximately of kowon and of ktc not owned by us 
the change in the net loss income attributable to the noncontrolling interest of our subsidiaries is as follows in millions kowon ktc total acquisition of the controlling interest in kopin taiwan corporation ktc 
from kopin taiwan corp s ktc inception in through july the company owned approximately of ktc 
in july  the company purchased  and  shares of ktc common stock for approximately  and  respectively which increased the company s ownership to approximately 
subsequent to the purchase of additional shares in july  ktc repaid the outstanding balance of loans due to us from ktc in the aggregate amount of approximately  we began consolidating ktc on july  in  the company purchased  shares of ktc common stock for approximately  to increase the company s ownership to approximately 
the consolidated statement of operations for the periods shown below includes the following amounts in millions which were related to transactions with ktc gain on remeasurement of kopin s previous investment in ktc repayment of loan by ktc which was previously written off reduction increase in bad debt allowance 
table of contents in the year ended december  we recorded equity losses of approximately million and a loan loss reserve of approximately million in connection with million we loaned ktc in fiscal as a result of the acquisition in july the loan was repaid  and in we recorded a gain on the loan repayment of approximately million and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of million 
in fiscal  due to ktc s liquidity problems we recorded allowances for possible bad debts for the excess amount ktc owed to us over what we owed ktc 
at december   the allowance for possible bad debts was approximately million 
during the nine months ended september  we reduced the allowance to  resulting in a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses of million 
prior to july we recorded our investment in ktc under the equity method and wrote down the investment to we remeasured and wrote up our investment in ktc by approximately million which represented the fair market value of the investment immediately prior to the acquisition in july fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
our revenues  which include product sales and amounts earned from research and development contracts  for fiscal years and were as follows in millions revenues iii v cyberdisplay total the decrease in our iii v revenues resulted from our customers reacting to the declining economic situation starting in late by reducing orders in the first quarter of  and declining prices of our hbt products  partially offset by the consolidation of kopin taiwan corporation s ktc revenues for the five month period ending december  g and smart phones offer more functions  for example web browsing  than a standard wireless handset 
g and smart phones require more hbt transistors than a standard wireless handset to support the increased functionality 
in the third quarter of we increased our ownership percentage of ktc from approximately to and commenced consolidating the results of ktc in the third quarter of included in kopin s consolidated results of operations for is million of revenues from ktc 
previous to the third quarter of we accounted for ktc on the equity method 
ktc manufactures hbt transistor wafers primarily for us but also sells to other taiwanese companies 
the increase in display revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year resulted from an increase in sales of our cyberdisplay products to customers that use them for military applications partially offset by decreases in sales of our products for consumer electronic and eyewear applications 
display revenues for and were as follows display revenues by category in millions military applications consumer electronic applications eyewear applications research development total revenues of our korean subsidiary  kowon  are included in cyberdisplay revenues and sales are primarily to us and samsung electronics for digital still camera and camcorder applications 
kowon s revenues decreased as a result of lower demand from us due to lower sales of displays to customers that use them for digital still

total cyberdisplay revenues by segment for and were as follows cyberdisplay revenues by segment in millions kopin us revenues kowon revenues to other customers kowon revenues kowon sales to kopin total revenues international sales represented and of product revenues for fiscal years and respectively 
the decrease in international sales is primarily attributable to an increase in sales of our cyberdisplay products for us military applications and iii v products to customers who are primarily us based and a decline in sales of our display products for digital still camera and camcorder applications to asian customers

essentially  we consider labor and overhead costs to be fixed in nature over the short term and therefore profitability is very dependent on the sales prices of our products and the volume of sales 
gross margins increased in  as compared to  because of an increase in sales of our display products for military applications  which have higher margins  and a decline in sales of display products for consumer electronic applications which have comparatively lower margins 
offsetting these increases in gross margins was a decline in the average unit selling prices of our iii v products as compared to there are a number of different display technologies which can produce displays in small form factors 
we believe one of the benefits of our display technology is the ability to produce high resolution displays in small form factors 
the camcorder and digital still camera markets are mature and the majority of these devices use low resolution display products which results in our having limited  if any  competitive advantage over our competitors and  therefore  the ability to sell displays into these markets is very price dependent 
accordingly for us to generate display revenues with above average gross margins  we will need to increase sales to customers who buy our higher resolution display products  such as the military  or develop new categories  such as eyewear

seasonality the markets for our iii v and consumer electronic cyberdisplay products are traditionally seasonal and we would expect that as our business matures  sales of these products would be strongest in the third quarter followed by our second quarter then our fourth quarter and our first quarter would be our lowest sales quarter 
the market for our display products for military applications is not expected to be seasonal
