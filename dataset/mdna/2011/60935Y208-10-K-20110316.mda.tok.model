item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
moneygram s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated due to various factors discussed below under cautionary statements regarding forward looking statements and under the caption risk factors in part  item a of this annual report on form k 
basis of presentation the financial statements in this annual report on form k are presented on a consolidated basis and include the accounts of the company and our subsidiaries 
see note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding consolidation 
references to moneygram  the company  we  us and our are to moneygram international  inc and its subsidiaries and consolidated entities 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
during the fourth quarter of  the company revised the presentation of its consolidated statements of income loss as a result of an internal review to enhance our external reporting and management reporting 
as a result of this review  the company will no longer present net revenue  previously measured as total revenue less total commissions expense  as this measure was not found to be a meaningful metric internally or to our external users 
the company will continue to separately disclose commissions expense 
in addition  the company has created an operating income measure consistent with management reporting and to more clearly delineate operating and non operating items 
as a result  certain items are now presented below the operating income line based on management s assessment of their nature as non operating  including securities gains losses  interest expense and gains losses related to cash flow hedges 
the securities gains losses and million of gains and million of losses related to historical cash flow hedges for the year ended december  and  respectively  were previously presented in revenue 
all prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this new presentation 

table of contents as further described in note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company has corrected the presentation of certain investments in time deposits and certificates of deposit in the and consolidated financial statements  reflecting the fact that these investments have original maturities in excess of three months but no greater than thirteen months 
fee and other revenue fee and other revenue consists of transaction fees  foreign exchange revenue and miscellaneous revenue 
transaction fees are earned on money transfer  money order  bill payment and official check transactions 
money transfer transaction fees vary based on the principal amount of the transaction  the originating location and the receiving location 
money order  bill payment and official check transaction fees are fixed per transaction 
foreign exchange revenue is derived from the management of currency exchange spreads on money transfer transactions involving different send and receive currencies 
miscellaneous revenue primarily consists of processing fees on rebate checks and controlled disbursements  service charges on aged outstanding money orders and money order dispenser fees 
investment revenue investment revenue consists of interest and dividends generated through the investment of cash balances received primarily from the sale of official checks  money orders and other payment instruments 
these cash balances are available to us for investment until the payment instrument is presented for payment 
investment revenue varies depending on the level of investment balances and the yield on our investments 
investment balances vary based on the number of payment instruments sold  the principal amount of those payment instruments and the length of time that passes until the instruments are presented for payment 
fee and other commissions expense we incur fee commissions primarily on our money transfer products 
in a money transfer transaction  both the agent initiating the transaction and the agent disbursing the funds receive a commission that is generally based on a percentage of the fee charged to the consumer 
we generally do not pay commissions to agents on the sale of money orders 
in certain limited circumstances for large agents  we may pay a fixed commission amount based on money order volumes transacted by that agent 
other commissions expense includes the amortization of capitalized agent signing bonus payments 
investment commissions expense investment commissions consist of amounts paid to financial institution customers based on short term interest rate indices times the average outstanding cash balances of official checks sold by that financial institution 
through the second quarter of  investment commissions expense included costs associated with interest rate swaps 
we historically used interest rate swaps to convert a portion of our variable rate commission payments to fixed rate payments  which hedged the interest rate risk associated with the variable rate commissions paid to our financial institution customers 
in connection with the interest rate swaps  we paid a fixed amount to a counterparty and received a variable rate payment in return 
to the extent that the fixed rate exceeded the variable rate  we incurred an expense related to the swap  if the variable rate exceeded the fixed rate  we recognized income related to the swap 
in connection with the restructuring of the official check business in  we terminated certain financial institution customer relationships 
as a result  we terminated the swaps related to commission payments in june see further discussion of the termination of these swaps in note derivative financial instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements

following is a summary of significant actions taken by the company and economic conditions during the year that impacted our operating results in global economic conditions throughout  worldwide economic conditions continued to remain weak  as evidenced by high unemployment rates  government assistance to citizens and businesses on a global basis  continued declines in asset values  restricted lending activity and low consumer confidence  among other factors 
historically  the money remittance industry has generally been resilient during times of economic softness as money transfers are deemed essential to many  with the funds used by the receiving party for food  housing and other basic needs 
however  given the global reach and extent of the current economic recession  the growth of money transfer volumes and the average principal of money transfers continued to fluctuate by corridor and country in in addition  bill payment products available in the united states are not as resilient as money transfers given the more discretionary nature of some items paid for by consumers using these products 
accordingly  the volume of bill payment transactions continued to be adversely impacted in  particularly in the auto  housing and credit card sectors 
while there have been some indicators of moderation and improvement throughout  particularly in the united states  we continue to have limited visibility into the future and believe growth rates will continue to be hampered in 
table of contents interest rate environment interest rates remained low through interest rates affect our business in several ways  but primarily through investment revenue  investment commission expense and interest expense 
first  the majority of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents and all classes of investments is floating rate  causing investment revenue to decrease when rates decline and increase when rates rise 
second  the commissions we pay to our financial institution customers are variable rate  primarily based on the effective federal funds rate 
accordingly  our investment commissions expense decreases when rates decline and increases when rates rise 
as discussed in table net investment revenue analysis  our net investment margin is based on the spread between the yield earned on our investment portfolio and the commission rates paid to our financial institution customers 
in the current environment  the federal funds rate is so low that most of our financial institution customers are in a negative commission position  in that we do not owe any commissions to our customers 
while the vast majority of our contracts require the financial institution customers to pay us for the negative commission amount  we have opted at this time to impose certain per item and other fees rather than require payment 
we continue to monitor the negative commissions and are reviewing our current fee structure for possible changes 
finally  our senior facility is floating rate debt  and accordingly  our interest expense will decrease in a declining rate environment and increase when rates rise 
money transfer pricing in the first half of  we introduced a price band that allows consumers to send of principal for a fee at most locations  or a fee at a walmart location 
in the fourth quarter of  we increased advertising for our domestic business and  in particular  promoted the new price band to every moneygram location across the united states 
as discussed further in table global funds transfer segment  the price band impacted revenue growth during the year 
as we expect the price band to be a long term change in our pricing  we anticipate revenue growth will continue to be impacted 
official check restructuring and repricing in the first quarter of  we initiated the restructuring of our official check business by changing the commission structure and exiting certain large customer relationships  particularly our top financial institution customers 
as of december   approximately billion of balances for the top customers have run off  with the remaining balances expected to run off as old issuances are presented to us for payment 
the run off of these balances reduced our investment revenue in in  we reduced the commission rate paid to the majority of our official check financial institution customers to reflect the impact of the realigned investment portfolio on the profitability of this product 
the repricing results in an average contractual payout rate of the effective federal funds rate less approximately basis points  and reduced our investment commissions expense 
see table net investment revenue analysis for further discussion on the impact of our official check restructuring and repricing initiative 
money order repricing and review in the fourth quarter of  we initiated the first phase of a repricing initiative for our money order product sold through retail agent locations 
this initiative increases the per item fee we receive for our money orders and reflects the impact of the realigned investment portfolio on the profitability of this product 
a broader second phase of repricing was initiated in the second quarter of in addition  we continue to review our credit exposure to our agents and may terminate or otherwise revise our relationship with certain agents 
as anticipated  money order volumes in and declined from these initiatives 
while we do not expect any further decline in money order volume due to our repricing initiatives  we do anticipate further market declines as consumers migrate to other payment products and as consumer prices increase due to agents passing along fee increases and changes in the general economic environment 
global transformation initiative in the second quarter of  we announced that we were implementing a global transformation initiative to realign our management and operations with the changing global market and streamline operations to promote a more efficient and scalable cost structure 
the initiative will include organizational changes  relocation of certain operations and investment in technology  among other items 
based upon preliminary estimates  the company anticipates incurring million to million of cash outlays in future phases to generate annual pre tax cost savings of million to million when fully implemented in in connection with the first phase of this initiative  we recorded million of expenses during  with million included in the compensation and benefits line  million included in the transactions and operations support line and million included in the occupancy  equipment and supplies line in our consolidated statements of income loss

we continue to believe that it is appropriate to maintain a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets due to significant negative evidence 
changes in facts and circumstances in the future may cause us to record additional tax benefits as further deferred tax valuation allowances are released and carry forwards are utilized 
we continue to evaluate additional available tax positions related to the net securities losses in prior years 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda and adjusted ebitda we believe that ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  including agent signing bonus amortization and adjusted ebitda ebitda adjusted for significant items provide useful information to investors because they are an indicator of the strength and performance of ongoing business operations  including our ability to service debt and fund capital expenditures  acquisitions and operations 
these calculations are commonly used as a basis for investors  analysts and credit rating agencies to evaluate and compare the operating performance and value of companies within our industry 
in addition  our debt agreements require compliance with financial measures similar to adjusted ebitda 
finally  ebitda and adjusted ebitda are financial measures used by management in reviewing results of operations  forecasting  assessing cash flow and capital  allocating resources and establishing employee incentive programs

table of contents segment performance our reporting segments are primarily organized based on the nature of products and services offered and the type of consumer served 
we primarily manage our business through two reporting segments  global funds transfer and financial paper products 
the global funds transfer segment provides global money transfers and bill payment services to consumers through a network of agents and  in select markets  company operated locations 
the financial paper products segment provides money orders to consumers through our retail and financial institution locations in the united states and puerto rico  and provides official check services to financial institutions in the united states 
businesses that are not operated within these segments are categorized as other  and primarily relate to discontinued products and businesses 
segment pre tax operating income and segment operating margin are used to review operating performance and allocate resources 
the global funds transfer segment is managed as two geographical regions or operating segments  the americas and emeaap  to coordinate sales  agent management and marketing activities 
the americas region includes the united states  canada  mexico  the caribbean and latin america 
the emeaap region includes europe  the middle east  africa and the asia pacific region 
we monitor performance and allocate resources at both a regional and reporting segment level 
as the two regions routinely interact in completing money transfer transactions and share systems  processes and licenses  we view the global funds transfer segment as one global network 
the nature of the consumers and products offered is the same for each region  and the regions utilize the same agent network  systems and support functions 
in addition  the regions have similar regulatory requirements and economic characteristics 
accordingly  we aggregate the two operating segments into one reporting segment 
segment accounting policies are the same as those described in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we manage our investment portfolio on a consolidated level  with no specific investment security assigned to a particular segment 
however  investment revenue is allocated to each segment based on the average investment balances generated by that segment s sale of payment instruments during the period 
net securities gains losses are not allocated to the segments as the investment portfolio is managed at a consolidated level 
while the derivatives portfolio is also managed on a consolidated level  each derivative instrument is utilized in a manner that can be identified to a particular segment 
interest rate swaps historically used to hedge variable rate commissions were identified with the official check product in the financial paper products segment  while forward foreign exchange contracts are identified with the money transfer product in the global funds transfer segment 
any interest rate swaps related to our credit agreements are not allocated to the segments 
also excluded from operating income for global funds transfer and financial paper products are interest and other expenses related to our credit agreements  items related to our preferred stock  operating income from businesses categorized as other  certain pension and benefit obligation expenses  director deferred compensation plan expenses  executive severance and related costs  certain legal and corporate costs not related to the performance of the segments and restructuring and related costs

excluding spain  transactions originating outside of the united states increased percent over the prior year 
transactions sent from spain decreased percent for the full year  but increased in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of money transfer transactions originating in the united states  excluding transactions sent to mexico  increased percent due primarily to an percent increase in intra united states remittances 
transactions sent to mexico declined percent from the impact of the united states recession on our consumers  but improved during the last half of the year

trends expected to impact the discussion of trends expected to impact our business in is based on information presently available and contains certain assumptions regarding future economic conditions 
differences in actual economic conditions during compared with our assumptions could have a material impact on our results 
see cautionary statements regarding forward looking statements and part i  item a  risk factors of this annual report on form k for additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those contemplated by the following forward looking statements 
throughout  global economic conditions remained weak 
we cannot predict the duration or extent of the severity of these economic conditions  nor the extent to which these conditions could negatively affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
while the money remittance industry has generally been resilient during times of economic softness  the current global economic conditions have continued to adversely impact the demand for money remittances 
given the global economic uncertainty  we have less visibility to the future and believe growth rates could continue to be impacted by slow economic conditions 
in addition  bill payment products available in the united states have not been as resilient as money transfers 
while there is uncertainty around the global economy and the remittance industry  the world bank  a key source of industry analysis for developing countries  is projecting five percent remittance growth in our growth has historically exceeded the world bank projections 
we expect our growth to be driven by agent expansion and increasing productivity in our existing agent locations through marketing support  customer acquisition and new product innovation 
we anticipate money transfer revenue growth to be lower than transaction growth through the first quarter of due to the lower average fees resulting from the price band that was introduced in the first half of we anticipate that the price band will be a long term change in our pricing 
we believe there is increased competitive pressure in the remittance industry and although we have not seen significant pricing pressure outside of the price band  we will continue to proactively manage our pricing efforts 
we believe all of these efforts will not only help to counteract the effects of the current global economic conditions  but position us for enhanced market share and growth when the economy begins to recover 

table of contents for our financial paper products segment  we expect the decline in overall paper based transactions to continue in as a result of the pricing initiatives undertaken in prior years  we have reduced the commission rates paid to our official check financial institution customers and instituted certain per item and other fees for both the official check and money order services 
in addition  the historically low interest rate environment has resulted in low or no commissions being paid to our official check financial institution customers 
as a result  we anticipate that the financial paper products segment will experience some financial institution and agent attrition in we do not believe that an increase in interest rates in will have a significant impact to our investment margin as the interest rates earned on the substantial portion of our investment portfolio reset on a frequent basis and our pricing initiatives have helped to mitigate interest rate risk 
we continue to see a trend among state  federal and international regulators toward enhanced scrutiny of anti money laundering compliance  as well as consumer fraud prevention and education 
as we continue to revise our processes and enhance our technology systems to meet regulatory trends  our operating expenses for compliance may increase 
as we implement the second phase of our global transformation initiative in  we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase in the short term as up front expenditures will be required to achieve the expected long term cost savings 
based on current plans for the second phase  we anticipate incurring cash outlays of up to million in related to restructuring  reorganization and technology investment activities 
up to million of these cash outlays are anticipated to be recognized as an expense in  with the remaining portion capitalized as internally developed software and amortized over future periods 
acquisition and disposal activity acquisition and disposal activity is set forth in note acquisitions and disposals of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
recapitalization on march   we completed a series of transactions pursuant to which we received an infusion of billion of gross equity and debt capital to support the long term needs of the business and provide necessary capital due to the investment portfolio losses in late and the first quarter of the recapitalization 
the net proceeds of the recapitalization were used to invest in cash equivalents to supplement our unrestricted assets and to repay million on our revolving credit facility 
for the key terms of the equity and debt capital issued  see note mezzanine equity and note debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
recent developments on march   we entered into a recapitalization agreement with thl and goldman sachs pursuant to which i thl will convert all of the shares of b stock into shares of our common stock in accordance with the certificate of designations  preferences and rights of series b participating convertible preferred stock of moneygram international  inc  ii goldman sachs will convert all of the shares of b stock into shares of d stock in accordance with the certificate of designations  preferences and rights of series b participating convertible preferred stock of moneygram international  inc  and iii thl will receive approximately million additional shares of our common stock and million in cash  and goldman sachs will receive approximately  additional shares of d stock equivalent to approximately million shares of our common stock and million in cash such transactions  collectively  the recapitalization

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have various resources available to us for purposes of managing liquidity and capital needs  including our investment portfolio  credit facilities and letters of credit 
we refer to our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  trading investments and related put options and available for sale investments collectively as our investment portfolio 
we utilize the assets in excess of payment service obligations measure shown below in various liquidity and capital assessments 
while assets in excess of payment service obligations  as defined  is a capital measure  it also serves as the foundation for various liquidity analyses 
table assets in excess of payment service obligations amounts in thousands cash and cash equivalents substantially restricted receivables  net substantially restricted short term investments substantially restricted trading investments and related put options substantially restricted available for sale investments substantially restricted payment service obligations assets in excess of payment service obligations liquidity our primary sources of liquidity include cash flows generated by the sale of our payment instruments  our cash and cash equivalent and short term investment balances  proceeds from our investment portfolio and credit capacity under our credit facilities 
our primary operating liquidity needs relate to the settlement of payment service obligations to our agents and financial institution customers  as well as general operating expenses 
to meet our payment service obligations at all times  we must have sufficient highly liquid assets and be able to move funds globally on a timely basis 
on average  we pay over billion a day to settle our payment service obligations 
we generally receive a similar amount on a daily basis for the principal amount of our payment instruments sold and the related fees 
we use the incoming funds from sales of new payment instruments to settle our payment service obligations for previously sold payment instruments 
this pattern of cash flows allows us to settle our payment service obligations through on going cash generation rather than liquidating investments or utilizing our revolving credit facility 
we have historically generated  and expect to continue generating  sufficient cash flows from daily operations to fund ongoing operational needs 
the timely remittance of funds by our agents and financial institution customers is an important component of our liquidity and allows for the pattern of cash flows described above 
if the timing of the remittance of funds were to deteriorate  it would alter our pattern of cash flows and could require us to liquidate investments or utilize our revolving credit facility to settle payment service obligations 
to manage this risk  we closely monitor the remittance patterns of our agents and financial institution customers and act quickly if we detect deterioration or alteration in remittance timing or patterns 
if deemed appropriate  we have the ability to deactivate an agent s equipment at any time  thereby preventing the initiation or issuance of further money transfers and money orders 
see enterprise risk management credit risk for further discussion of this risk and our mitigation efforts 
we also seek to maintain liquidity beyond our operating needs to provide a cushion through the normal fluctuations in our payment service assets and obligations and to invest in the infrastructure and growth of our business 
while the assets in excess of payment service obligations  as shown in table  would be available to us for our general operating needs and investment in the company  we consider a portion of our assets in excess of payment service obligations as additional assurance that regulatory and contractual requirements are maintained 
we believe we have sufficient assets and liquidity to operate and grow our business for the next months 
should our liquidity needs exceed our operating cash flows  we believe that our external financing sources  including availability under our senior facility  will be sufficient to meet any liquidity needs 

table of contents cash and cash equivalents and short term investments to ensure we maintain adequate liquidity to meet our operating needs at all times  we keep a significant portion of our investment portfolio in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments at financial institutions rated aa or better by moody s investor service moody s and aa or better by standard poors s p  and in us government money market funds rated aaa by moody s and aaa by s p 
as of december   cash and equivalents and short term investments totaled billion  representing percent of our total investment portfolio 
cash equivalents and short term investments consist of money market funds that invest in united states government and government agency securities  time deposits and certificates of deposit 
clearing and cash management banks we move and receive money through a network of clearing and cash management banks 
the relationships with these clearing banks and cash management banks are a critical component of our ability to move monies on a global and timely basis 
we have agreements with nine clearing banks that provide clearing and processing functions for official checks  money orders and other draft instruments 
we have eight official check clearing banks  of which five banks are currently operating under post termination arrangements of their contracts 
the remaining three active banks provide sufficient capacity for our official check business 
we rely on two banks to clear our retail money orders and believe that these banks provide sufficient capacity for that business 
one clearing bank contract has financial covenants that include the maintenance of total cash  cash equivalents  receivables and investments in an amount at least equal to total outstanding payment service obligations  as well as the maintenance of a minimum percent ratio of total assets held at that bank to instruments estimated to clear through that bank 
financial covenants related to special purpose entities spes include the maintenance of specified ratios of greater than percent of cash  cash equivalents and investments held in the spe to outstanding payment instruments issued by the related financial institution 
we also maintain contractual relationships with a variety of domestic and international cash management banks for ach and wire transfer services used in the movement of consumer funds and agent settlements 
there are a limited number of international cash management banks with a network large enough to manage cash settlements for our entire agent base  and some of these large international banks have opted not to bank money service businesses 
as a result  we also utilize regional or country based banking partners in addition to large cash management banks 
special purpose entities for certain of our financial institution customers  we established individual spes upon the origination of our relationship 
along with operational processes and certain financial covenants  these spes provide the financial institutions with additional assurance of our ability to clear their official checks 
under these relationships  the investment portfolio assets and payment service obligations related to the financial institution customer are all held by the spe 
in most cases  the fair value of the investment portfolio must be maintained in excess of the payment service obligations 
as the related financial institution customer sells our payment service instruments  the principal amount of the instrument and any fees are paid into the spe 
as payment service instruments issued by the financial institution customer are presented for payment  the cash and cash equivalents within the spe are used to settle the instrument 
as a result  cash and cash equivalents within spes are generally not available for use outside of the spe 
we remain liable to satisfy the obligations  both contractually and under the uniform commercial code  as the issuer and drawer of the official checks regardless of the existence of the spes 
accordingly  we consolidate all of the assets and liabilities of these spes in our consolidated balance sheets  with the individual assets and liabilities of the spes classified in a manner similar to our other assets and liabilities 
under limited circumstances  the financial institution customers that are beneficiaries of the spes have the right to either demand liquidation of the assets in the spes or to replace us as the administrator of the spe 
such limited circumstances consist of material  and in most cases continued  failure to uphold our warranties and obligations pursuant to the underlying agreements with the financial institutions 
the combined spes hold percent of our billion portfolio as of december   as compared to percent at december  as the spes relate to financial institution customers we terminated in connection with the restructuring of our official check business  we expect the spes to continue to decline as a percentage of our portfolio as the outstanding instruments related to the financial institutions roll off 

table of contents credit facilities our credit facilities consist of a senior facility and second lien notes 
see note debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
during  we repaid million of outstanding tranche b debt under our senior facility 
combined with previous debt repayments  we have repaid million of our outstanding debt since january   including the repayment of the full million balance on our revolving credit line  million of prepayments on tranche b debt and million of scheduled quarterly principal payments on tranche b debt 
we continue to evaluate further reductions of our outstanding debt ahead of scheduled maturities 
following is a summary of our outstanding debt at december table schedule of credit facilities interest rate facility outstanding amounts in thousands for size interest tranche a  due tranche b  net of unamortized discount  due revolving credit facility  due first lien senior secured debt second lien notes  due total debt reflects the interest that will be paid in using the rates in effect on december   assuming no prepayments of principal and the continued payment of interest on the second lien notes 
our revolving credit facility has million of borrowing capacity as of december   net of million of outstanding letters of credit issued 
amounts outstanding under the senior facility are due upon maturity in as a result of our debt prepayments  there are no mandatory principal payments required on tranche b until maturity in we may elect an interest rate for the senior facility at each reset period based on either the united states prime bank rate or the eurodollar rate  with a minimum rate of basis points set for the eurodollar option 
the interest rate election may be made individually for each term loan and each draw under the revolving credit facility 
for the revolving credit facility and tranche a  the interest rate is either the united states prime bank rate plus basis points or the eurodollar rate plus basis points 
in addition  we incur fees of basis points on the daily unused availability under the revolving credit facility 
the interest rate for tranche b can be set at either the united states prime bank rate plus basis points or the eurodollar rate plus basis points 
through and as of the date of this filing  our interest rates have been set based on the united states prime bank rate 
amounts outstanding under the second lien notes are due upon maturity in the interest rate on the second lien notes is percent per year 
prior to march   we have the option to capitalize interest at a rate of percent 
if interest is capitalized  percent of the interest is payable in cash and percent is capitalized into the outstanding principal balance 
we have paid the interest on the second lien notes through december   and we anticipate that we will pay the interest on the second lien notes that is due march  our credit facilities contain various financial and non financial covenants 
a violation of these covenants could negatively impact our liquidity by restricting our ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility and or causing acceleration of amounts due under the credit facilities 
the financial covenants in our credit facilities measure leverage  interest coverage and liquidity 
leverage is measured through a senior secured debt ratio calculated as consolidated indebtedness to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  adjusted for certain items such as net securities gains losses  stock based compensation expense  certain legal settlements and asset impairments  among other items adjusted ebitda 
this measure is similar  but not identical  to the measure discussed under table ebitda and adjusted ebitda 
interest coverage is calculated as adjusted ebitda to net cash interest expense 
liquidity is measured as assets in excess of payment service obligations  as shown in table  adjusted for various exclusions 
we are in compliance with all financial covenants as of december  
table of contents the terms of our credit facilities also place restrictions on certain types of payments we may make  including dividends to our preferred and common stockholders  acquisitions and the funding of foreign subsidiaries  among others 
we do not anticipate these restrictions to limit our ability to grow the business either domestically or internationally 
in addition  we may only make dividend payments to common stockholders subject to an incremental build up based on our consolidated net income in future periods 
no dividends were paid on our common stock in  and we do not anticipate declaring any dividends on our common stock during equity registration rights agreement the company and the investors also entered into a registration rights agreement the equity registration rights agreement on march   with respect to the series b stock and d stock  and the common stock owned by the investors and their affiliates collectively  the registrable securities 
under the terms of the equity registration rights agreement  we are required  after a specified holding period  to use our reasonable best efforts to promptly file with the sec a shelf registration statement relating to the offer and sale of the registrable securities 
we are obligated to keep such shelf registration statement continuously effective under the securities act of  as amended the securities act  until the earlier of the date as of which all of the registrable securities have been sold  the date as of which each of the holders of the registrable securities is permitted to sell its registrable securities without registration pursuant to rule under the securities act and fifteen years 
the holders of the registrable securities are also entitled to five demand registrations and unlimited piggyback registrations during the term of the equity registration rights agreement 
on december   we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec which would permit the offer and sale of the registrable securities  as required by the terms of the equity registration rights agreement 
the registration statement also would permit the company to offer and sell up to million of its common stock  preferred stock  debt securities or any combination of these  from time to time  subject to market conditions and the company s capital needs 
the registration statement is subject to review by the sec and has not yet been declared effective by the sec 
credit ratings as of december  our credit ratings from moody s  s p and fitch ratings fitch were b  b and b  respectively  with a stable outlook assigned by the three credit rating agencies 
our credit facilities  regulatory capital requirements and other obligations are not impacted by the level of our credit ratings 
however  higher credit ratings could increase our ability to attract capital  minimize our weighted average cost of capital and obtain more favorable terms with our lenders  agents and clearing and cash management banks 
mezzanine equity our series b stock pays a cash dividend of percent 
at the company s option  we may accrue dividends at a rate of percent through march  and percent thereafter 
we have accrued dividends from the issuance of series b stock through december  contractual and regulatory capital regulatory capital requirements we have capital requirements relating to government regulations in the united states and other countries where we operate 
such regulations typically require us to maintain certain assets in a defined ratio to our payment service obligations 
through our wholly owned subsidiary and licensed entity  mpsi  we are regulated in the united states by various state agencies that generally require us to maintain a pool of liquid assets and investments in an amount generally equal to the regulatory payment service obligation measure  as defined by each state  for our regulated payment instruments  namely teller checks  agent checks  money orders and money transfers 
the regulatory requirements do not require us to specify individual assets held to meet our payment service obligations  nor are we required to deposit specific assets into a trust  escrow or other special account 
rather  we must maintain a pool of liquid assets 
provided we maintain a total pool of liquid assets sufficient to meet the regulatory and contractual requirements  we are able to withdraw  deposit or sell our individual liquid assets at will  without prior notice  penalty or limitations 

table of contents the regulatory requirements in the united states are similar to our internal measure of assets in excess of payment service obligations set forth in table assets in excess of payment service obligations 
the regulatory payment service assets measure varies by state 
the most restrictive states may exclude assets held at banks that do not belong to a national insurance program  varying amounts of accounts receivable balances and or assets held in the spes 
the regulatory payment service obligation measure varies by state  but in all cases is substantially lower than our payment service obligations as disclosed in the consolidated balance sheets as we are not regulated by state agencies for payment service obligations resulting from outstanding cashier s checks or for amounts payable to agents and brokers 
all states require mpsi to maintain positive net worth  with one state also requiring mpsi to maintain positive tangible net worth of million 
we are also subject to regulatory requirements in various countries outside of the united states  which typically results in needing to either prefund agent settlements or hold minimum required levels of cash within the applicable country 
the most material of these requirements is in the united kingdom  where our licensed entity  moneygram international limited  is required to maintain a cash and cash equivalent balance equal to outstanding payment instruments issued in the european community 
this amount will fluctuate based on our level of activity within the european community  and is likely to increase over time as our business expands in that region 
assets used to meet these regulatory requirements support our payment service obligations  but are not available to satisfy other liquidity needs 
as of december   we had approximately million of cash deployed outside of the united states to meet regulatory requirements 
we were in compliance with all financial regulatory requirements as of december  we believe that our liquidity and capital resources will remain sufficient to ensure on going compliance with all financial regulatory requirements 
available for sale investments our investment portfolio includes million of available for sale investments as of december  united states government agency residential mortgage backed securities and united states government agency debentures compose million of our available for sale investments  while other asset backed securities compose the remaining million 
in completing our recapitalization in  we contemplated that our other asset backed securities might decline further in value 
accordingly  the capital raised assumed a zero value for these securities 
as a result  further unrealized losses and impairments on these securities are already funded and would not cause us to seek additional capital or financing 
other funding sources and requirements contractual obligations the following table includes aggregated information about the company s contractual obligations that impact our liquidity and capital needs 
the table includes information about payments due under specified contractual obligations  aggregated by type of contractual obligation 
table contractual obligations payments due by period less than more than amounts in thousands total year years years years debt  including interest payments operating leases other obligations total contractual cash obligations 
table of contents debt consists of amounts outstanding under our senior facility and the second lien notes at december   as shown in table schedule of credit facilities 
our consolidated balance sheet at december  includes million of debt  net of unamortized discounts of million  and less than million of accrued interest on the debt 
the above table reflects the principal and interest that will be paid through the maturity of the debt using the rates in effect on december   and assuming no prepayments of principal and the continued payment of interest on the second lien notes 
operating leases consist of various leases for buildings and equipment used in our business 
other obligations are unfunded capital commitments related to our limited partnership interests included in other asset backed securities in our investment portfolio 
we have other commitments as described further below that are not included in table as the timing and or amount of payments are difficult to estimate 
the company s series b stock has a cash dividend rate of percent 
at the company s option  dividends may be accrued through march  at a rate of percent in lieu of paying a cash dividend 
due to restrictions in our debt agreements  we elected to accrue the dividends in and expect that dividends will be accrued for at least the next months 
while no dividends have been declared as of december   we have accrued dividends of million in our consolidated balance sheets as accumulated and unpaid dividends are included in the redemption price of the series b stock regardless of whether dividends have been declared 
we have a funded  noncontributory pension plan that is frozen to both future benefit accruals and new participants 
our funding policy has historically been to contribute the minimum contribution required by applicable regulations 
we made contributions of million to the defined benefit pension plan during we anticipate a minimum contribution of up to million to the pension plan trust in we also have certain unfunded pension and postretirement plans that require benefit payments over extended periods of time 
during  we paid benefits totaling million related to these unfunded plans 
benefit payments under these unfunded plans are expected to be million in expected contributions and benefit payments under these plans are not included in the above table as it is difficult to estimate the timing and amount of benefit payments and required contributions beyond the next months 
see note pensions and other benefits of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
as of december   the liability for unrecognized tax benefits was million 
as there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash outflows associated with liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 
in limited circumstances  we may grant minimum commission guarantees as an incentive to new or renewing agents for a specified period of time at a contractually specified amount 
under the guarantees  we will pay to the agent the difference between the contractually specified minimum commission and the actual commissions earned by the agent 
as of december   the minimum commission guarantees had a maximum payment of million over a weighted average remaining term of years 
the maximum payment is calculated as the contractually guaranteed minimum commission times the remaining term of the contract and  therefore  assumes that the agent generates no money transfer transactions during the remainder of its contract 
as of december   the liability for minimum commission guarantees is million 
minimum commission guarantees are not reflected in the table above

our most prominent risk exposures are credit  interest rate  foreign currency exchange and operational risk 
see part  item a risk factors for a description of the principal risks to our business 
appropriately managing risk is important to the success of our business  and the extent to which we effectively manage each of the various types of risk is critical to our financial condition and profitability 
our risk management objective is to monitor and control risk exposures to produce steady earnings growth and long term economic value 
management implements policies approved by our board of directors that cover our investment  capital  credit and foreign currency practices and strategies 
the board receives periodic reports regarding each of these areas and approves significant changes to policy and strategy 
an asset liability committee  composed of senior management  routinely reviews investment and risk management strategies and results 
a credit committee  composed of senior management  routinely reviews credit exposure to our agents 
following is a discussion of the strategies we use to manage and mitigate the risks we have deemed most critical to our business 
while containing forward looking statements related to risks and uncertainties  this discussion and related analyses are not predictions of future events 
moneygram s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated due to various factors discussed under cautionary statements regarding forward looking statements and under risk factors in part  item a of this annual report on form k 
credit risk credit risk  or the potential risk that we may not collect amounts owed to us  affects our business primarily through receivables  investments and derivative financial instruments 
in addition  the concentration of our cash  cash equivalents and investments at large financial institutions exposes us to credit risk 

table of contents investment portfolio credit risk from our investment portfolio relates to the risk that we may be unable to collect the interest or principal owed to us under the legal terms of the various securities 
our primary exposure to credit risk arises through the concentration of a large amount of our investment portfolio at a few large financial institutions financial institution risk  as well as a concentration in securities issued by  or collateralized by  us government agencies 
we manage credit risk related to our investment portfolio by investing in short term assets and in issuers with strong credit ratings 
our investment policy permits the investment of funds only in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and securities issued by us government agencies with a maturity of months or less 
the financial institutions holding significant portions of our investment portfolio act as custodians for our asset accounts  serve as counterparties to our foreign currency transactions and conduct cash transfers on our behalf for the purpose of clearing our payment instruments and related agent receivables and agent payables 
through certain check clearing agreements and other contracts  we are required to utilize several of these financial institutions 
as a result of the credit market crisis  several financial institutions have faced capital and liquidity issues that led them to restrict credit exposure 
this has led certain financial institutions to require that we maintain pre defined levels of cash  cash equivalents and investments at these financial institutions overnight  with no restrictions to our usage of the assets during the day 
while the credit market crisis and recession affected all financial institutions  those institutions holding our assets are well capitalized  and there have been no significant concerns as to their ability to honor all obligations related to our holdings 
we manage financial institution risk by entering into clearing and cash management agreements primarily with major financial institutions  and regularly monitoring the credit ratings of these financial institutions 
our financial institution risk is further mitigated as the majority of our cash equivalents and investments held by these institutions are invested in securities issued by us government agencies or money market instruments collateralized by us government agencies  which have the implicit or explicit guarantee of the us government depending upon the issuing agency 
our non interest bearing cash held at our domestic clearing and cash management banks was covered under the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp through december  as those banks opted into the program 
the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic created the tlgp program to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks  thrifts and certain holding companies  and providing full coverage of non interest bearing deposit transaction accounts  regardless of dollar amount 
in addition  official checks issued by our financial institution customers were treated as deposits under the tlgp 
the tlgp expired on december   but has been replaced by provisions in the recently passed dodd frank act  which amend the federal deposit insurance act fdi act to provide unlimited fdic insurance on non interest bearing accounts through december  in addition to cash in non interest bearing accounts  the final rule s definition of non interest bearing transaction accounts encompasses official checks issued by insured depository institutions 
official checks  such as cashier checks and money orders issued by insured depository institutions  are deposits as defined under the fdi act 
the payee of the official check is the insured party 
the legislation will also allow banks to begin paying interest on demand deposit accounts beginning on july  however  this alternative does not provide unlimited insurance coverage 
with respect to our credit union customers  our credit exposure is partially mitigated by national credit union administration insurance 
however  as our credit union customers were not insured by a tlgp equivalent program  we have required certain credit union customers to provide us with larger balances on deposit and or to issue cashier s checks only 
while the value of these assets are not at risk in a disruption or collapse of a counterparty financial institution  the delay in accessing our assets could adversely affect our liquidity and potentially our earnings depending upon the severity of the delay and corrective actions we may need to take 
corrective actions could include draws upon our senior facility to provide short term liquidity until our assets are released  reimbursements of costs or payment of penalties to our agents and higher banking fees to transition banking relationships in a short timeframe 

table of contents the concentration in us government agencies includes agencies placed under conservatorship by the us government in and extended unlimited lines of credit from the us treasury 
the implicit guarantee of the us government and its actions to date support our belief that the us government will honor the obligations of its agencies if the agencies are unable to do so themselves 
the following table shows categories of our investment portfolio held within and outside of the united states  with each section progressing from the company s perceived lowest to highest credit risk 
all but million of the investment portfolio is invested in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and investments issued or collateralized by us government agencies 
approximately percent of the portfolio is invested in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  with percent invested in financial institutions located within the united states 
cash and cash equivalents held in financial institutions outside of the united states is placed to comply with local requirements or for operating use by our international entities

table of contents receivables credit risk related to receivables is the risk that we are unable to collect the funds owed to us by our agents and financial institution customers who have collected the principal amount and fees associated with the sale of our payment instruments from the consumer on our behalf 
substantially all of the business conducted by our global funds transfer segment is conducted through independent agents  while the business conducted by the financial paper products segment is conducted through both independent financial institution customers and agents 
our agents and financial institution customers receive the principal amount and fees related to the sale of our payment instruments  and we must then collect these funds from them 
as a result  we have credit exposure to our agents and financial institution customers 
agents typically have from one to three days to remit the funds  with longer remittance schedules granted to international agents and certain domestic agents 
as of december   we had credit exposure to our agents of million in the aggregate spread across over  agents  of which three agents owed us in excess of million each 
as of december   we had a credit exposure to our official check financial institution customers of approximately million in the aggregate spread across  financial institutions  of which one owed us in excess of million 
our strategy in managing credit risk related to receivables is to ensure that the revenue generation from an agent or financial institution customer is sufficient to provide for an appropriate level of credit risk and to reduce concentrations of risk through diversification  termination of agents or financial institution customers with poor risk reward ratios or other means 
management s decision during the fourth quarter of to terminate its ach commerce business was based primarily on a review of the credit risk associated with that business 
as our official checks are issued solely through financial institution customers  we do not consider our credit exposure related to receivables to be significant for official checks 
due to the larger average principal amount of money orders  we consider our credit exposure from money orders to be of higher risk than exposure due to money transfers 
however  in the current macroeconomic environment and as a result of our international growth  credit risk related to our money transfer products is increasing 
while the extent of credit risk may vary by product  the process for mitigating risk is substantially the same 
we assess the creditworthiness of each potential agent before accepting them into our distribution network 
this underwriting process includes not only a determination of whether to accept a new agent  but also the remittance schedule and volume of transactions that the agent will be allowed to perform in a given timeframe 
we actively monitor the credit risk of our existing agents by conducting periodic comprehensive financial reviews and cash flow analyses of our agents that average high volumes of transactions and monitoring remittance patterns versus reported sales on a daily basis 
in the current macroeconomic environment  we have tightened our underwriting requirements and have initiated earlier action against agents with a pattern of delayed or late remittances 
we also utilize software embedded in our money transfer and retail money order point of sale equipment which provides credit risk management abilities 
first  this software allows us to control both the number and dollar amount of transactions that can be completed by both agent and location in a particular timeframe 
second  this software allows us to monitor for suspicious transactions or volumes of sales  which assists us in uncovering irregularities such as money laundering  fraud or agent self use 
finally  the software allows us to remotely disable the point of sale equipment to prevent agents from transacting if suspicious activity is noted or remittances are not received according to the agent s contract 
the point of sale software requires each location to be re authorized on a daily basis for transaction processing 
where appropriate  we will also require bank issued lines of credit to support our receivables and guarantees from the owners or parent companies  although such guarantees are often unsecured 
the risk related to official checks is mitigated by only selling these products through financial institution customers  who have never defaulted on their remittances to us and have had only rare instances of delayed remittances 
substantially all of our financial institution customers have a next day remit requirement  which reduces the build up of credit exposure at each financial institution 
in addition  the termination of our top financial institution customers in connection with the restructuring of our official check business in has resulted in less credit exposure at a relatively small number of financial institutions 

table of contents agents who only sell money orders typically have longer remit timeframes than other agents  in addition  the per transaction revenue tends to be smaller for money orders than for money transfers 
as part of our review of the money order business  we evaluated our money order only agents to identify agents where the credit risk outweighs the revenue potential 
the company considered various mitigation actions for the identified agents  including termination of relationships  reductions in permitted transaction volumes and dollars  repricing the fees charged to the agent and prefunding by the agent of average remittances 
derivative financial instruments credit risk related to our derivative financial instruments relates to the risk that we are unable to collect amounts owed to us by the counterparties to our derivative agreements 
with the termination of our interest rate swaps in the second quarter of  our derivative financial instruments are used solely to manage exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
if the counterparties to any of our derivative financial instruments were to default on payments or experience credit rating downgrades  the value of the derivative financial instruments would decline and adversely impact our operating income 
we manage credit risk related to derivative financial instruments by entering into agreements with only major financial institutions and regularly monitoring the credit ratings of these financial institutions 
we also only enter into agreements with financial institutions that are experienced in the foreign currency upon which the agreement is based 
interest rate risk interest rate risk represents the risk that our operating results are negatively impacted  and our investment portfolio declines in value  due to changes in interest rates 
given the nature of the realigned investment portfolio  particularly the high credit rating of financial institutions holding or issuing our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  along with the implicit guarantee of the us government backing our money markets and majority of available for sale investments  we believe there is a low risk that the value of these securities would decline such that we would have a material adverse change in our operating results 
as of december   the company held million  or  of the investment portfolio in fixed rate investments 
at december   the company s other asset backed securities are priced on average at five cents on the dollar for a total fair value of million 
while the company does believe its other asset backed securities are at a risk of further decline  the recapitalization completed on march  included funds to cover all losses on these securities  as well as the trading investments 
accordingly  any resulting adverse movement in our stockholders equity or assets in excess of payment service obligations from further declines in investments would not result in regulatory or contractual compliance exceptions 
our operating results are primarily impacted by interest rate risk through our net investment margin  which is investment revenue less commissions expense 
as the money transfer business is not materially affected by investment revenue and pays commissions that are not tied to an interest rate index  interest rate risk has the most impact on our money order and official check businesses 
after the portfolio realignment  we are invested primarily in interest bearing cash accounts  deposit accounts  time deposits and certificates of deposit  and us government money market funds 
these types of investments have minimal risk of declines in fair value from changes in interest rates  with the interest rate resetting frequently  if not daily 
our commissions paid to financial institution customers are variable rate  based primarily on the federal funds effective rate and are reset daily 
accordingly  both our investment revenue and our investment commissions expense will decrease when rates decline and increase when rates rise 
as a result of our repricing initiative  described below  and the frequent resetting of interest rates earned on the investment portfolio  we believe that investment revenue and investment commissions would increase or decrease approximately in tandem 
in addition  the investment portfolio and commission interest rates may differ  resulting in basis risk 
we do not believe this risk is material and therefore do not currently employ any hedging strategies to address the basis risk between our commission rates and our investment portfolio  nor do we currently expect to employ such hedging strategies 
as a result  our net investment margin may be adversely impacted if changes in the commission rate move by a larger percentage than the yield on our investment portfolio 

table of contents in the second quarter of  we repriced our official check product to an average of federal funds effective rate less basis points to better match our investment commission rate with our lower yield realigned portfolio 
in the current environment  the federal funds effective rate is so low that most of our financial institution customers are in a negative commission position  in that we do not owe any commissions to our customers 
while many of our contracts require the financial institution customers to pay us the negative commission amount  we have opted not to require such payment at this time 
as the revenue earned by our financial institution customers from the sale of our official checks primarily comes from the receipt of their investment commissions from us  the negative commissions reduce the revenue our financial institution customers earn from our product 
accordingly  our financial institution customers may sharply reduce their issuances of official checks or choose to not renew their contracts with us if the negative commission positions continue 
a substantial decline in the amount of official checks sold would reduce our investment balances  which would in turn result in lower investment revenue for us 
as official checks are still required for many financial transactions  including home closings and vehicle purchases  we believe that risk is naturally mitigated in part 
we continue to assess the potential impact of negative commissions on our official check business 
while there are currently no plans for changes to our business as a result of the negative commissions  we may elect in the future to change some portion of our compensation structure for select financial institution customers to mitigate the risk of substantial declines in our investment balances 
our senior facility is floating rate debt  resulting in decreases to interest expense in a declining rate environment and increases to interest expense when rates rise 
the company may elect an interest rate for the senior facility at each reset period based on the united states prime bank rate or the eurodollar rate 
for the revolving credit facility and tranche a  the interest rate is either the united states prime bank rate plus basis points or the eurodollar rate plus basis points 
as of december  the company has no outstanding balance related to the revolving credit facility 
for tranche b  the interest rate is either the united states prime bank rate plus basis points or the eurodollar rate plus basis points 
under the terms of the senior facility  the interest rate determined using the eurodollar index has a minimum rate of percent 
throughout  the company elected to use the united states prime bank rate as its basis 
elections are based on the index which we believe will yield the lowest interest rate until the next reset date 
interest rate risk is managed in part through index election 
the income statement simulation analysis below incorporates substantially all of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities  together with forecasted changes in the balance sheet and assumptions that reflect the current interest rate environment 
this analysis assumes the yield curve increases gradually over a one year period 
components of our pre tax income that are interest rate sensitive include investment revenue  investment commissions expense and interest expense 
as a result of the current federal funds rate environment  the outcome of the income statement simulation analysis on investment commissions expense in a declining rate scenario is not meaningful as we have no downside risk 
in the current federal funds rate environment  the worst case scenario is that we would not owe any commissions to our financial institution customers as the commission rate would decline to zero or become negative 
accordingly  we have not presented the impact of the simulation in a declining rate environment for investment commissions expense

table of contents foreign currency risk we are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business as we offer our products and services through a network of agents and financial institutions with locations in countries and operate subsidiaries in countries 
as this risk may have an adverse effect on our earnings and equity  we hedge material transactional exposures when feasible using forward or option contracts 
translation risk  generated from translating foreign currency denominated earnings into us dollars for reporting purposes  is not hedged as this is not considered an economic exposure 
in  the decline of the euro exchange rate net of hedging activities resulted in a net decrease to our operating results of million over by policy  we do not speculate in foreign currencies  all currency trades relate to underlying transactional exposures 
our primary source of transactional currency risk is the money transfer business in which funds are frequently transferred cross border and we settle with agents in multiple currencies 
although this risk is somewhat limited due to the fact that these transactions are short term in nature  we currently manage some of this risk with forward contracts to protect against potential short term market volatility 
in addition  we buy and sell in the spot market daily to settle transactions 
the primary currency pairs  based on volume  that are traded against the dollar in the spot and forward markets include the european euro  mexican peso  british pound and indian rupee 
the duration of forward contracts is typically less than one month 
realized and unrealized gains or losses on transactional currency risk hedges and any associated revaluation of balance sheet exposures are recorded in transaction and operations support in the consolidated statement of income loss 
the fair market value of any open hedges at period end are recorded in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
the net effect of changes in foreign exchange rates and the related forward contracts for the year ended december  was a loss of million 
we do not currently have any forward contracts that are designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
had the euro appreciated depreciated relative to the us dollar by percent from actual exchange rates for  pre tax operating income would have increased decreased million for the year 
this sensitivity analysis does not consider the impact of our hedging program 
operational risk operational risk represents the potential for loss resulting from our operations 
this may include  but is not limited to the risk of fraud by employees or external parties  business continuation and disaster recovery  errors related to transaction processing and technology  unauthorized transactions and breaches of information security and compliance requirements 
this risk may also include the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory requirements 
management has direct responsibility for identifying  controlling and monitoring operational risks within their business 
business managers maintain a system of controls to provide transaction authorization and execution  safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft  and to ensure the quality of financial and other data 
our business resiliency group works with each business function to develop plans to support business resumption activities including technology  networks and data centers 
our internal audit function tests the system of internal controls through risk based audit procedures and reports on the effectiveness of internal controls to executive management and the audit committee of the board of directors 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
on a regular basis  management reviews its accounting policies  assumptions and estimates to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
see note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 

table of contents critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations  and that require management to make estimates that are difficult  subjective or complex 
based on these criteria  management has identified and discussed with the audit committee the following critical accounting policies and estimates  including the methodology and disclosures related to those estimates 
fair value of investment securities investment securities classified as trading and available for sale are recorded at fair value 
realized gains and losses and other than temporary impairments related to these investment securities  along with unrealized gains and losses related to trading securities  are reported in the net securities gains losses line in the consolidated statements of income loss 
unrealized gains and losses related to available for sale securities are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders deficit 
we measure fair value as an exit price  or the exchange price that would be received for an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
a three level hierarchy has been established for fair value measurements based upon the observability of the inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability  and requires that the use of observable inputs be maximized and the use of unobservable inputs be minimized 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
the degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of an investment is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters 
fair value for the majority of our investments is estimated using quoted market prices in active markets for similar securities  broker quotes or industry standard models that utilize independently sourced market parameters 
we receive prices from an independent pricing service for the vast majority of the fair value of our investment securities 
we verify these prices through periodic internal valuations  as well as through comparison to comparable securities  any broker quotes received and liquidation prices 
the independent pricing service will only provide a price for an investment if there is sufficient observable market information to obtain objective pricing 
we receive prices from an independent pricing service for all investments classified as residential mortgage backed securities and us government agencies  as well as certain other asset backed securities 
for investments that are not actively traded  or for which there is not sufficient observable market information  we estimate fair value using broker quotes when available 
when such quotes are not available  and to verify broker quotes received  we estimate fair value using industry standard pricing models that utilize independently sourced market observable parameters  discount margins for comparable securities adjusted for differences in our security  risk and liquidity premiums observed in the market place  default rates  prepayment speeds  loss severity and information specific to the underlying collateral to the investment 
we maximize the use of market observable information to the extent possible  and make our best estimate of the assumptions that a similar market participant would make 
our other asset backed securities are primarily valued through the use of broker quotes or internal valuations 
the use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
due to the subjective nature of these assumptions  the estimates determined may not be indicative of the actual exit price if the investment was sold at the measurement date 
in the current market  the most subjective assumptions include the default rate of collateral securities and loss severity as it relates to our other asset backed securities 
as of december   we continue to hold investments classified as other asset backed securities with a fair value of million 
using the highest and lowest prices received as part of the valuation process described above  the range of fair value for these securities was million to million 
at december   million  or less than percent  of our total investment portfolio was valued using internal pricing information 
no third party price was able to be obtained for these securities 

table of contents goodwill we perform impairment testing of our goodwill balances annually as of november  and whenever an impairment indicator is identified 
the testing is performed by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values 
the fair value of our reporting units is estimated based on expected future cash flows discounted using a weighted average cost of capital rate the discount rate 
our discount rate is based on our debt and equity balances  adjusted for current market conditions and investor expectations of return on our equity 
in addition  an assumed terminal value is used to project future cash flows beyond base years 
assumptions used in our impairment testing  such as forecasted growth rates and the discount rate  are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans 
the estimates and assumptions regarding expected cash flows  terminal values and the discount rate require considerable judgment and are based on historical experience  financial forecasts and industry trends and conditions 
in connection with the annual impairment test for  we assessed the global funds transfer reporting unit  which had assigned goodwill of million 
no goodwill is assigned to the other reporting units 
the annual impairment test indicated a fair value for the global funds transfer reporting unit that was substantially in excess of the reporting unit s carrying value 
this excess is consistent with our expectations for the reporting unit and market indicators 
accordingly  we believe the goodwill assigned to the global funds transfer reporting unit is not impaired 
if the discount rate for the global funds transfer reporting unit increases by basis points from the rate used in our fair value estimate  fair value would be reduced by approximately million  assuming all other components of the fair value estimate remain unchanged 
if the growth rate for the global funds transfer reporting unit decreases by basis points from the rate used in our fair value estimate  fair value would be reduced by approximately million  assuming all other components of the fair value estimate remain unchanged 
our estimated fair value for the global funds transfer reporting unit would continue to be substantially in excess under either scenario 
pension obligations through our qualified pension plan and various supplemental executive retirement plans  collectively referred to as our pension plans  we provide defined benefit pension plan coverage to certain of our employees and former employees of viad 
our pension obligations under these plans are measured as of december the measurement date 
pension benefits and the related expense are based upon actuarial projections using assumptions regarding mortality  discount rates  long term return on assets and other factors 
following are the weighted average actuarial assumptions used in calculating the benefit obligation as of each measurement date and the net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december net periodic benefit cost discount rate expected return on plan assets rate of compensation increase projected benefit obligation discount rate rate of compensation increase at each measurement date  the discount rate is based on the then current interest rates for high quality  long term corporate debt securities with maturities comparable to our obligations 
the rate of compensation increase is applicable to the supplemental executive retirement plans the serps only and is based on historical compensation patterns for the plan participants and management s expectations for future compensation patterns 
during  benefit accruals under all but one of the serps were frozen  for the one serp  service credit is frozen  but future pay increases continue to be applicable for active participants 
accordingly  the rate of compensation has a nominal impact on the valuation for and future years 

table of contents our pension plan assets are primarily invested in interest bearing cash accounts and commingled trust funds issued or sponsored by the plan trustee 
our investments are periodically realigned in accordance with the investment guidelines 
the expected return on pension plan assets is based on our historical market experience  our pension plan investment strategy and our expectations for long term rates of return 
we also consider peer data and historical returns to assess the reasonableness and appropriateness of our expected return 
our pension plan investment strategy is reviewed annually and is based upon plan obligations  an evaluation of market conditions  tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments 
at december   the pension assets are composed of approximately percent in us domestic and international equity stock funds  approximately percent in fixed income securities such as global bond funds and corporate obligations  approximately percent in a real estate limited partnership interest and approximately percent in other securities 
the actual rate of return on average pension assets in was percent  as compared to a percent rate of return in we believe the returns indicate continued stabilization in the markets  and anticipate a return to historical long term norms in the future 
this is consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate greater long term returns and the historical cyclicality of the investment markets 
accordingly  we do not believe that the actual return for is significantly different from the long term expected return used to estimate the benefit obligation 
in addition  the participants of our plans are relatively young  providing the plan assets with sufficient time to recover to historical return rates 
our assumptions reflect our historical experience and management s best judgment regarding future expectations 
certain of the assumptions  particularly the discount rate and expected return on plan assets  require significant judgment and could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension obligation 
changing the discount rate by basis points would have increased decreased pension expense by million 
changing the expected rate of return by basis points would have increased decreased pension expense by million 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
in determining taxable income  income or losses before taxes are adjusted for various differences between local tax laws and generally accepted accounting principles 
the determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events  such as the amount  timing and character of deductions and the sources and character of income and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements and treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis  and operating loss and tax credit carry backs and carry forwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted statutory tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid 
we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets based on a more likely than not threshold 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is deemed more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized  we establish or maintain a valuation allowance 
we weigh the positive and negative evidence commensurate with the extent it may be objectively verified 
it is generally difficult for positive evidence regarding projected future taxable income  exclusive of reversing taxable temporary differences  to outweigh objective negative evidence  particularly cumulative losses 
our assessment of whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted requires judgment and is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis 
we consider  among other matters the nature  frequency and severity of any cumulative financial reporting losses  the ability to carry back losses to prior years  future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  tax planning strategies  and projections of future taxable income 
the accounting treatment of our deferred taxes represents our best estimate of these items 
a valuation allowance established or revised as a result of our assessment is recorded through income tax expense benefit in our consolidated statements of income loss 
changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events  or other factors  could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we account for our liability for unrecognized tax benefits using a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit by the tax authority  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
our tax filings for various periods are subject to audit by various tax authorities 
actual tax amounts may be materially different from amounts accrued based upon the results of audits by the tax authorities 
the amount of income tax or benefit recognized in our consolidated statements of income loss includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate based on current information and management s best estimate  as well as any applicable related net interest and penalties 
prior to our june spin off from viad  income taxes were determined on a separate return basis as if we had not been eligible to be included in the consolidated income tax return of viad and its affiliates 
we are considered the divesting entity in the spin off and treated as the accounting successor to viad  with the continuing business of viad is referred to as new viad 
as part of the spin off  we entered into a tax sharing agreement with viad which provides for  among other things  the allocation between moneygram and new viad of federal  state  local and foreign tax liabilities and tax liabilities resulting from the audit or other adjustment to previously filed tax returns 
although we believe that we have appropriately proportioned such taxes between moneygram and viad  subsequent adjustments may occur upon filing of amended returns or resolution of audits by various taxing authorities
