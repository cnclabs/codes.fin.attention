critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company has identified the policies outlined below as critical to its business operations and an understanding of results of operations 
the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all accounting policies 
valuation of available for sale investments the company considers all of its marketable securities available for sale and reports them at fair market value 
fair market values are based on quoted market prices 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale investments are excluded from income  but are included  net of taxes  in other comprehensive income 
if an other than temporary impairment is determined to exist  the difference between the value of the investment recorded in the financial statements and the company s current estimate of fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment is determined 
net unrealized gains on available for sale investments at june  were million 
valuation of inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
the company regularly reviews inventory on hand for slow moving and obsolete inventory  inventory not meeting quality control standards and inventory subject to expiration 
to meet strict customer quality standards  the company has established a highly controlled manufacturing process for proteins and antibodies 
new protein and antibody products require the initial manufacture of multiple batches to determine if quality standards can be consistently met 
in addition  the company will produce larger batches of established products than current sales requirements due to economies of scale 
the manufacturing process for proteins and antibodies  therefore  has and will continue to produce quantities in excess of forecasted usage 
the company values its manufactured protein and antibody inventory based on a two year forecast 
the establishment of a two year forecast requires considerable judgment 
protein and antibody quantities in excess of the two year usage forecast are not valued due to uncertainty over salability 
the value of protein and antibody inventory not valued at june  was million 
the fair value of inventory purchased in fiscal through the acquisitions of boston biochem and tocris were determined based on quantities acquired  selling prices at the date of acquisition and management s assumptions regarding inventory having future value and the costs to sell such inventories 
at the acquisition dates  the value of acquired inventory was increased million for a total acquired inventory value of million 
in addition  the company acquired inventory that was not valued as part of the purchase price allocation as it was in excess of forecasted usage 
the increase in value of the acquired inventory remaining at june  was million 

table of contents valuation of intangible assets and goodwill when a business is acquired  the purchase price is allocated  as applicable  between tangible assets  identifiable intangible assets and goodwill 
determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to intangible assets requires significant estimates 
the fair value of intangible assets acquired in fiscal  including developed technologies  trade names  customer relationships and a non compete agreement  were based on management s forecasted cash inflows and outflows using a relief from royalty and multi period excess earnings method with consideration to other factors including an independent valuation of management s assumptions 
intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives  ranging from to years 
the company reviews the carrying amount of intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  were million at june  goodwill recognized in connection with a business acquisition represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists 
assessing the impairment of goodwill requires the company to make judgments regarding the fair value of the net assets of its reporting units and the allocation of the carrying amount of shared assets to the reporting units 
the company s annual assessment included comparison of the carrying amount of the net assets of a reporting unit  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
a significant change in the company s market capitalization or in the carrying amount of net assets of a reporting unit could result in an impairment charge in future periods 
the company completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and concluded that no impairment existed as of june   as the fair values of the company s reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values  with the exception of the tocris and boston biochem reporting units which were acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal the carrying values of tocris and boston biochem approximate fair values at june  goodwill at june  was million 
valuation of investments the company has made equity investments in several start up and early development stage companies  among them chemocentryx  inc ccx  nephromics  hemerus medical llc hemerus  and actgen  inc actgen 
the accounting treatment of each investment cost method or equity method is dependent upon a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the company s share in the equity of the investee and the company s ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee 
in determining which accounting treatment to apply  the company must make judgments based upon the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the investment 
the company periodically assesses its equity investments for impairment 
development stage companies of the type the company has invested in are dependent on their ability to raise additional funds to continue research and development efforts and on receiving patent protection and or us food and drug administration fda clearance to market their products 
if such funding were unavailable or inadequate to fund operations or if patent protection or fda clearance were not received  the company would potentially recognize an impairment loss to the extent of its remaining net investment 
the company s net investments at june  in ccx  nephromics  hemerus and actgen were million  million   and  respectively

foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in other non operating expense  net in the consolidated statement of earnings
