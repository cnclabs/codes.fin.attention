msmf is licensed as a small business investment company sbic by the united states small business administration sba and the investment manager acts as msmf manager and investment adviser 
because the investment manager  which employs all of the executive officers and other employees of mscc  is wholly owned by us  we do not pay any external investment advisory fees  but instead we incur the net operating costs associated with employing investment and portfolio management professionals through the investment manager

msc ii commenced operations in january  is an investment fund that operates as an sbic and is also managed by the investment manager 
the exchange offer and related transactions  including the transfer of the msc ii gp interests  are collectively termed the exchange offer transactions see note j to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   an approximately minority ownership in the total dollar value of the msc ii limited partnership interests remained outstanding  including approximately owned by affiliates of mscc 
mscc has direct or indirect subsidiaries that have elected to be taxable entities the taxable subsidiaries 
the primary purpose of these entities is to hold certain investments that generate pass through income for tax purposes 
the taxable subsidiaries are each taxed at their normal corporate tax rates based on their taxable income 
unless otherwise noted or the context otherwise indicates  the terms we  us  our and main street refer to mscc and its subsidiaries  including msmf  msc ii  and the taxable subsidiaries 
overview we are a principal investment firm primarily focused on providing customized debt and equity financing to lower middle market lmm companies  which we generally define as companies with annual revenues between million and million that operate in diverse industries 
we invest primarily in secured debt instruments  equity investments  warrants and other securities of lmm companies based in the united states 
our principal investment objective is to maximize our portfolio total return by generating current income from our debt investments and capital appreciation from our equity and equity related investments  including 
table of contents warrants  convertible securities and other rights to acquire equity securities in a portfolio company 
our lmm portfolio investments generally range in size from million to million 
we seek to fill the current financing gap for lmm businesses  which  historically  have had more limited access to financing from commercial banks and other traditional sources 
given the current credit environment  we believe the limited access to financing for lmm companies is even more pronounced 
the underserved nature of the lower middle market creates the opportunity for us to meet the financing needs of lmm companies while also negotiating favorable transaction terms and equity participations 
our ability to invest across a company capital structure  from senior secured loans to equity securities  allows us to offer portfolio companies a comprehensive suite of financing solutions  or one stop financing 
providing customized  one stop financing solutions has become even more relevant to our lmm portfolio companies in the current credit environment 
we generally seek to partner directly with entrepreneurs  management teams and business owners in making our investments 
main street believes that its lmm investment strategy has a lower correlation to the broader debt and equity markets 
in addition to our investment strategy of investing in lmm companies  we opportunistically pursue investments in privately placed debt securities 
this private placement investment portfolio primarily consists of direct or secondary private placements of interest bearing securities in companies that are generally larger in size than the lmm companies included in our investment portfolio 
as of december   we had privately placed portfolio investments in companies collectively totaling approximately million in fair value with a total cost basis of approximately million 
the weighted average revenues for the privately placed portfolio company investments was approximately million 
all of our privately placed portfolio investments were in the form of debt investments and of such debt investments at cost were secured by first priority liens on portfolio company assets 
the weighted average effective yield on main street privately placed portfolio debt investments was approximately as of december  our portfolio investments are generally made through mscc and the funds 
mscc and the funds share the same investment strategies and criteria  although they are subject to different regulatory regimes 
an investor return in mscc will depend  in part  on the funds investment returns as msmf is a wholly owned subsidiary of mscc and msc ii is a majority owned subsidiary of mscc 
the level of new portfolio investment activity will fluctuate from period to period based upon our view of the current economic fundamentals  our ability to identify new investment opportunities that meet our investment criteria  and our ability to consummate identified opportunities 
the level of new investment activity  and associated interest and fee income  will directly impact future investment income 
in addition  the level of dividends paid by portfolio companies and the portion of our portfolio debt investments on non accrual status will directly impact future investment income 
while we intend to grow our portfolio and our investment income over the long term  our growth and our operating results may be more limited during depressed economic periods 
however  we intend to appropriately manage our cost structure and liquidity position based on applicable economic conditions and our investment outlook 
the level of realized gains or losses and unrealized appreciation or depreciation will also fluctuate depending upon portfolio activity and the performance of our individual portfolio companies 
the changes in realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation or depreciation could have a material impact on our operating results 
for the year ended december   we paid dividends on a monthly basis totaling per share  or million 
we generated undistributed taxable income or spillover income of approximately million  or per share  during that will be carried forward toward distributions paid in in december  we declared monthly dividends for the first quarter of totaling per share 
in march  we declared monthly dividends for the second quarter of totaling per share 
including the dividends declared for the first and second quarters of  we will have paid approximately per share in cumulative dividends since our october initial public offering 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  and idle funds investments 
in august  we completed a follow on public stock offering in which we sold  shares of common stock  including the underwriters exercise of the over allotment option  at a price to the public of per share or approximately of the then latest reported net asset value 
table of contents per share  resulting in total net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriters commissions and offering costs 
in january  we completed a follow on public stock offering in which we sold  shares of common stock  including the underwriters exercise of the over allotment option  at a price to the public of per share or approximately of the then latest reported net asset value per share  resulting in total net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriters commissions and offering costs 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of enacted in february the stimulus bill contains several provisions applicable to sbic funds  including the funds 
one of the key sbic related provisions included in the stimulus bill increased the maximum amount of combined sbic leverage or sbic leverage cap to million for affiliated sbic funds 
the prior maximum amount of sbic leverage available to affiliated sbic funds was approximately million 
since the increase in the sbic leverage cap applies to affiliated sbic funds  main street is required to allocate such increased borrowing capacity between the funds 
main street has access to an incremental million in sbic leverage capacity  subject to the required capitalization of each of the funds  in addition to the million of existing sbic leverage at the funds 
a proposed bill  the small business financing and investment act of  or hr  would increase the total sbic leverage capacity for affiliated sbic funds from million to million 
if enacted  this bill would increase main street sbic leverage capacity through the funds by an additional million 
while main street is positioned to benefit from the full congressional passage of hr  the ultimate form and likely outcome of such legislation or any similar legislation cannot be predicted 
in our view  the sbic leverage  including the increased capacity  remains a strategic advantage due to its long term  flexible structure and its low fixed cost 
the sbic leverage also provides proper matching of duration and cost compared with our lmm portfolio investments 
as of december   the weighted average duration of our lmm portfolio debt investments was approximately years compared to a weighted average duration of years for our sbic leverage 
as of december   approximately of lmm portfolio debt investments bear interest at fixed rates which is also appropriately matched by the long term  low cost fixed rates available through our sbic leverage 
critical accounting policies basis of presentation our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
for the year ended december   our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of mscc and its consolidated subsidiaries  including msmf and msc ii 
for the year ended  our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of mscc and its consolidated subsidiaries  including msmf 
portfolio investments  as used herein  refers to all of our portfolio investments in lmm companies  private placement portfolio investments  and the investment manager and excludes all marketable securities and idle funds investments 
private placement portfolio investments include investments made through direct or secondary purchases of interest bearing securities in companies that are generally larger in size than the lmm companies included as part of our portfolio investments 
marketable securities and idle funds investments are classified as financial instruments and are reported separately on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated schedule of investments due to the nature of such investments 
our results of operations and cash flows for the years ended december    and  and financial position as of december  and  are presented on a consolidated basis 
the effects of all intercompany transactions between main street and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation 
certain reclassifications have been made to prior period balances to conform with the current financial statement presentation  including the reclassification of private placement portfolio investments which were formerly classified as marketable securities and idle funds investments and are now classified as portfolio investments in the non control non affiliate investments category due to our current intent to hold such investments until their maturity and the fact that their terms adhere more to our portfolio investment strategy 

table of contents under the investment company rules and regulations pursuant to article of regulation s x and the audit and accounting guide for investment companies issued by the american institute of certified public accountants the aicpa guide  we are precluded from consolidating portfolio company investments  including those in which we have a controlling interest  unless the portfolio company is another investment company 
an exception to this general principle in the aicpa guide occurs if we own a controlled operating company that provides all or substantially all of its services directly to us  or to an investment company of ours 
none of the investments made by us qualify for this exception 
therefore  our portfolio investments are carried on the balance sheet at fair value  as discussed further in note b to our consolidated financial statements  with any adjustments to fair value recognized as net change in unrealized appreciation depreciation on our statement of operations until the investment is exited  resulting in any gain or loss on exit being recognized as a net realized gain loss from investments 
portfolio investment valuation the most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is the valuation of our portfolio investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation 
as of december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our total assets represented investments in portfolio companies valued at fair value including the investment in the investment manager 
we are required to report our investments at fair value 
we adopted the provisions of the accounting standards codification codification or asc  fair value measurements and disclosures in the first quarter of asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value  and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
our portfolio strategy calls for us to invest primarily in illiquid securities issued by private  lmm companies 
these lmm portfolio investments may be subject to restrictions on resale and will generally have no established trading market 
we determine in good faith the fair value of our lmm portfolio investments pursuant to a valuation policy in accordance with asc and a valuation process approved by our board of directors and in accordance with the act 
we review external events  including private mergers  sales and acquisitions involving comparable companies  and include these events in the valuation process 
our valuation policy and process are intended to provide a consistent basis for determining the fair value of the portfolio 
for valuation purposes  control investments are composed of equity and debt securities for which we have a controlling interest in the portfolio company or have the ability to nominate a majority of the portfolio company board of directors 
market quotations are generally not readily available for our control investments 
as a result  we determine the fair value of control investments using a combination of market and income approaches 
under the market approach  we will typically use the enterprise value methodology to determine the fair value of these investments 
the enterprise value is the fair value at which an enterprise could be sold in a transaction between two willing parties  other than through a forced or liquidation sale 
typically  private companies are bought and sold based on multiples of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  cash flows  net income  revenues  or in limited cases  book value 
there is no single methodology for estimating enterprise value 
for any one portfolio company  enterprise value is generally described as a range of values from which a single estimate of enterprise value is derived 
in estimating the enterprise value of a portfolio company  we analyze various factors  including the portfolio company historical and projected financial results 
we allocate the enterprise value to investments in order of the legal priority of the investments 
we will also use the income approach to determine the fair value of these securities  based on projections of the discounted future free cash flows that the portfolio company or the debt security will likely generate 
the valuation approaches for our control investments estimate the value of the investment if we were to sell  or exit  the investment  assuming the highest and best use of the investment by market participants 
in addition  these valuation approaches consider the value associated with our ability to control the capital structure of the portfolio company  as well as the timing of a potential exit 
for valuation purposes  non control lmm portfolio investments are composed of debt and equity securities for which we do not have a controlling interest in the portfolio company  or the ability to nominate 
table of contents a majority of the portfolio company board of directors 
market quotations for non control lmm investments are generally not readily available 
for our non control lmm portfolio investments  we use a combination of the market and income approaches to value our equity investments and the income approach to value our debt instruments 
for non control lmm debt investments  we determine the fair value primarily using a yield approach that analyzes the discounted cash flows of interest and principal for the debt security  as set forth in the associated loan agreements  as well as the financial position and credit risk of each of these portfolio investments 
our estimate of the expected repayment date of a lmm debt security is generally the legal maturity date of the instrument  as we generally intend to hold our loans to maturity 
the yield analysis considers changes in leverage levels  credit quality  portfolio company performance and other factors 
we will use the value determined by the yield analysis as the fair value for that security  however  because of our general intent to hold our loans to maturity  the fair value will not exceed the face amount of the lmm debt security 
a change in the assumptions that we use to estimate the fair value of our lmm debt securities using the yield analysis could have a material impact on the determination of fair value 
if there is deterioration in credit quality or a debt security is in workout status  we may consider other factors in determining the fair value of a lmm debt security  including the value attributable to the debt security from the enterprise value of the portfolio company or the proceeds that would be received in a liquidation analysis 
our private placement portfolio investments primarily consist of direct or secondary purchases of interest bearing securities in companies that are generally larger in size than the lmm companies included in our investment portfolio 
for valuation purposes  all of our private placement portfolio investments are non control investments and are composed of debt securities for which we do not have a controlling interest in the portfolio company  or the ability to nominate a majority of the portfolio company board of directors 
we primarily use observable inputs to determine the fair value of these investments through obtaining third party quotes or independent pricing 
due to the inherent uncertainty in the valuation process  our estimate of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed 
in addition  changes in the market environment  portfolio company performance and other events that may occur over the lives of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be materially different than the valuations currently assigned 
we estimate the fair value of each individual investment and record changes in fair value as unrealized appreciation or depreciation 
revenue recognition interest and dividend income we record interest and dividend income on the accrual basis to the extent amounts are expected to be collected 
dividend income is recorded as dividends are declared or at the point an obligation exists for the portfolio company to make a distribution 
in accordance with our valuation policy  we evaluate accrued interest and dividend income periodically for collectability 
when a loan or debt security becomes days or more past due  and if we otherwise do not expect the debtor to be able to service all of its debt or other obligations  we will generally place the loan or debt security on non accrual status and cease recognizing interest income on that loan or debt security until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due 
if a loan or debt security status significantly improves regarding ability to service the debt or other obligations  or if a loan or debt security is fully impaired  sold or written off  we will remove it from non accrual status 
fee income we may periodically provide services  including structuring and advisory services  to our portfolio companies 
for services that are separately identifiable and evidence exists to substantiate fair value  income is recognized as earned  which is generally when the investment or other applicable transaction closes 
fees received in connection with debt financing transactions for services that do not meet these criteria are treated as debt origination fees and are accreted into interest income over the life of the financing 

table of contents payment in kind pik interest while not significant to the total portfolio  we hold debt and preferred equity instruments in our investment portfolio that contain payment in kind pik interest and cumulative dividend provisions 
the pik interest  computed at the contractual rate specified in each debt agreement  is added to the principal balance of the debt and is recorded as interest income 
thus  the actual collection of this interest may be deferred until the time of debt principal repayment 
cumulative dividends are recorded as dividend income  and any dividends in arrears are added to the balance of the preferred equity investment 
the actual collection of dividends in arrears may be deferred until such time as the preferred equity is redeemed 
to maintain regulated investment company ric tax treatment as discussed below  these non cash sources of income will need to be paid out to stockholders in the form of distributions  even though we may not have collected the pik interest and cumulative dividends in cash 
we will stop accruing pik interest and cumulative dividends and will write off any accrued and uncollected interest and dividends in arrears when it is determined that such pik interest and dividends in arrears are no longer collectible 
share based compensation we account for our share based compensation plans using the fair value method  as prescribed by asc  compensation stock compensation 
accordingly  for restricted stock awards  we measured the grant date fair value based upon the market price of our common stock on the date of the grant and will amortize this fair value to share based compensation expense over the requisite service period or vesting term 
income taxes mscc has elected and intends to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to a ric under subchapter m of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  and  among other things  intends to make the required distributions to its stockholders as specified therein 
in order to qualify as a ric  mscc is required to timely distribute to its stockholders at least of investment company taxable income  as defined by the code  each year 
depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year  mscc may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year and pay a excise tax on such income 
any such carryover taxable income must be distributed through a dividend declared prior to filing the final tax return related to the year which generated such taxable income 
the taxable subsidiaries hold certain portfolio investments of main street 
the taxable subsidiaries are consolidated for us gaap reporting purposes  and the portfolio investments held by them are included in main street consolidated financial statements 
the taxable subsidiaries permit main street to hold equity investments in portfolio companies which are pass through entities for tax purposes in order to comply with the source income requirements contained in the ric tax provisions 
the taxable subsidiaries are not consolidated with main street for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense  or benefit  as a result of their ownership of certain portfolio investments 
this income tax expense  or benefit  is reflected in main street consolidated statement of operations 
the taxable subsidiaries use the liability method in accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements  using statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
taxable income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses 
taxable income generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation  as investment gains or losses are not included in taxable income until they are realized 

table of contents lmm portfolio composition lmm portfolio investments principally consist of secured debt  equity warrants and direct equity investments in privately held  lmm companies 
the lmm debt investments are secured by either a first or second lien on the assets of the portfolio company  generally bear interest at fixed rates  and generally mature between five and seven years from the original investment 
in most lmm portfolio companies  we also receive nominally priced equity warrants and or make direct equity investments  usually in connection with a debt investment 
summaries of the composition of our lmm investment portfolio at cost and fair value as a percentage of total lmm portfolio investments are shown in the following table cost december  december  first lien debt equity second lien debt equity warrants fair value december  december  first lien debt equity equity warrants second lien debt the following table shows the lmm portfolio composition by geographic region of the united states at cost and fair value as a percentage of total lmm portfolio investments

table of contents our lmm portfolio investments carry a number of risks including  but not limited to investing in lmm companies which may have a limited operating history and financial resources  holding investments that are not publicly traded and which may be subject to legal and other restrictions on resale  and other risks common to investing in below investment grade debt and equity investments in private  lmm companies 
portfolio asset quality we utilize an internally developed investment rating system to rate the performance of each portfolio company 
investment rating represents a portfolio company that is performing in a manner which significantly exceeds expectations and projections 
investment rating represents a portfolio company that  in general  is performing above expectations 
investment rating represents a portfolio company that is generally performing in accordance with expectations 
investment rating represents a portfolio company that is underperforming expectations 
investments with such a rating require increased monitoring and scrutiny by us 
investment rating represents a portfolio company that is significantly underperforming 
investments with such a rating require heightened levels of monitoring and scrutiny by us and involve the recognition of significant unrealized depreciation on such investment 
all new portfolio investments receive an initial rating 
the following table shows the distribution of our lmm and privately placed portfolio investments excluding the investment in our affiliated investment manager on the to investment rating scale at fair value as of december  and december  december  investment rating investments at fair value percentage of total portfolio investments at fair value percentage of total portfolio dollars in thousands totals based upon our investment rating system  the weighted average rating of our portfolio as of december  and was approximately and  respectively 
as of december  and  we had two and three investments  respectively  on non accrual status comprising approximately and  respectively  of the total portfolio investments at fair value for each year then ended excluding main street investment in the investment manager 
the broader fundamentals of the united states economy remain mixed  and unemployment remains elevated 
in the event that the united states economy contracts  it is likely that the financial results of small to mid sized companies  like those in which we invest  could experience deterioration or limited growth from current levels  which could ultimately lead to difficulty in meeting their debt service requirements and an increase in defaults 
in addition  the end markets for certain of our portfolio companies products and services have experienced negative economic trends over the last few years 
consequently  we can provide no assurance that the performance of certain portfolio companies will not be negatively impacted by these economic or other conditions  which could also have a negative impact on our future results

in september  we entered into an million  three year credit facility the credit facility with a group of bank lenders  and in january  we expanded the credit facility from million to million 
the purpose of the credit facility is to provide additional liquidity in support of future investment and operational activities 
the revisions to the credit facility provide several benefits to main street  including i an expansion of the total 
table of contents committed facility size to million compared with main street prior million credit facility  ii increased advance rates applicable to main street eligible investments  iii the addition of new lenders which further diversifies the main street lending group to a total of six participants  and iv an extension of the maturity date to september  the accordion feature of the credit facility allows us to seek up to million of total commitments from new or existing lenders on the same terms and conditions as the existing commitments 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest  subject to main street election  on a per annum basis equal to i the applicable libor rate plus or ii the applicable base rate plus 
main street pays unused commitment fees of per annum on the average unused lender commitments under the credit facility 
the credit facility is secured by a first lien on the assets of mscc and its subsidiaries  excluding the assets of the funds

at december   main street had million in borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and recognized  in interest expense for the year ended december  related to its credit facilities 
as of december   main street was in compliance with all financial covenants of the credit facility 
in august  we completed a follow on public stock offering in which we sold  shares of common stock  including the underwriters exercise of the over allotment option  at a price to the public of per share or approximately of the then latest reported net asset value per share  resulting in total net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriters commissions and offering costs 
in january  we completed a follow on public stock offering in which we sold  shares of common stock  including the underwriters exercise of the over allotment option  at a price to the public of per share or approximately of the then latest reported net asset value per share  resulting in total net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriters commissions and offering costs 
due to each of the funds status as a licensed sbic  we have the ability to issue  through the funds  debentures guaranteed by the sba at favorable interest rates 
under the regulations applicable to sbic funds  an sbic can have outstanding debentures guaranteed by the sba generally in an amount up to twice its regulatory capital  which effectively approximates the amount of its equity capital 
debentures guaranteed by the sba have fixed interest rates that equal prevailing year treasury note rates plus a market spread and have a maturity of ten years with interest payable semi annually 
the principal amount of the debentures is not required to be paid before maturity but may be pre paid at any time 
debentures issued prior to september were subject to pre payment penalties during their first five years 
those pre payment penalties no longer apply to debentures issued after september  on december   we  through the funds  had million of outstanding indebtedness guaranteed by the sba  which carried a weighted average fixed interest rate of approximately 
the first maturity related to the sbic debentures does not occur until  and the weighted average duration is years as of december  the stimulus bill contains several provisions applicable to sbic funds  including the funds 
one of the key sbic related provisions included in the stimulus bill increased the maximum amount of combined sbic leverage or sbic leverage cap to million for affiliated sbic funds 
the prior maximum amount of sbic leverage available to affiliated sbic funds was approximately million 
since the increase in the sbic leverage cap applies to affiliated sbic funds  main street is required to allocate such increased borrowing capacity between the funds 
subsequent to the exchange offer  main street now has access to an incremental million in sbic leverage capacity  subject to the required capitalization of each of the funds  in addition to the million of existing msc ii sbic leverage and the million of msmf sbic leverage 
a proposed bill  the small business financing and investment act of  or hr  would increase the total sbic leverage capacity for affiliated sbic funds from million to million 
if enacted  this bill would increase main street sbic leverage capacity through the funds by an additional million 

table of contents while main street is positioned to benefit from the full congressional passage of hr  the ultimate form and likely outcome of such legislation or any similar legislation cannot be predicted 
we anticipate that we will continue to fund our investment activities through existing cash and cash equivalents  the liquidation of marketable securities and idle funds investments  and a combination of future debt and equity capital 
our primary uses of funds will be investments in portfolio companies  operating expenses and cash distributions to holders of our common stock 
we periodically invest excess cash balances into marketable securities and idle funds investments 
the investment objective of marketable securities and idle funds investments is to generate incremental cash returns on excess cash balances prior to utilizing those funds for investment in our lmm and private placement portfolio investment strategy 
marketable securities and idle funds investments generally consist of debt investments  independently rated debt investments  certificates of deposit with financial institutions  and diversified bond funds 
the composition of marketable securities and idle funds investments will vary in a given period based upon  among other things  changes in market conditions  the underlying fundamentals in our marketable securities and idle funds investments  our outlook regarding future lmm and private placement portfolio investment needs  and any regulatory requirements applicable to main street 
if our common stock trades below our net asset value per share  we will generally not be able to issue additional common stock at the market price unless our stockholders approve such a sale and our board of directors makes certain determinations 
a proposal  approved by our stockholders at our june annual meeting of stockholders  authorizes us to sell shares of our common stock below the then current net asset value per share of our common stock in one or more offerings for a period of one year ending on june  we would need similar future approval from our stockholders to issue shares below the then current net asset value per share any time after the expiration of the current approval 
in order to satisfy the code requirements applicable to a ric  we intend to distribute to our stockholders substantially all of our taxable income  but we may also elect to periodically spillover certain excess undistributed taxable income from one tax year into the next tax year 
in addition  as a bdc  we generally are required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets to total senior securities  which include borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future  of at least 
this requirement limits the amount that we may borrow 
in january  we received exemptive relief from the sec that permits us to exclude sba guaranteed debt issued by our wholly owned sbic subsidiary  msmf  from our asset coverage ratio  which  in turn  enables us to fund more investments with debt capital 
we expect to obtain similar relief from the sec with respect to sbic debt securities issued by msc ii  including the million of currently outstanding debt related to its participation in the sbic program 
current market conditions although we have been able to secure access to additional liquidity  including our expanded million credit facility  recent public stock offerings  and the increase in available leverage through the sbic program as part of the stimulus bill  there is no assurance that debt or equity capital will be available to us in the future on favorable terms  or at all
