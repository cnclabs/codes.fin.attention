we fund our liquidity requirements primarily through cash and cash equivalents on hand  cash flow from operations and borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
on october   we refinanced our revolving credit facility 
we believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand  future funds from operations and borrowings from our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements for at least the next months 
there is no assurance  however  that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or maintain our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility 
we ended fiscal with million of cash and cash equivalents compared with million in fiscal after reducing our long term debt by million  or  during fiscal  we further reduced our long term debt by million  or  during fiscal to million from million at the end of fiscal the 
table of contents following table summarizes our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years fiscal year dollars in thousands total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net decrease in cash and cash equivalents the seasonality of our business historically provides greater cash flow from operations during the holiday and winter selling season  with fourth fiscal quarter net sales traditionally generating the strongest profits of our fiscal year 
typically  we use operating cash flow and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund inventory increases in anticipation of the holidays and our inventory levels are at their highest in the months leading up to christmas 
as holiday sales significantly reduce inventory levels  this reduction  combined with net income  historically provides us with strong cash flow from operations at the end of our fiscal year 
for fiscal  we purchased larger quantities of inventory primarily in anticipation of improving business conditions and as a result of increased availability of certain products 
the higher inventory levels combined with lower than anticipated sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal resulted in reduced operating cash flow for the year 
for fiscal  our improved earnings contributed to higher cash flow from operations compared to fiscal  which enabled us to continue to reduce our long term debt levels year over year 
for fiscal and we purchased lower quantities of inventory to reduce our overall inventory levels in anticipation of weaker consumer demand resulting from the economic recession 
in fiscal  we increased our capital spending for new store openings after curtailing such investments in fiscal in response to the recession 
operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflected higher inventory levels at the end of fiscal as a result of lower than anticipated fourth quarter holiday sales 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal also reflected higher accounts receivable balances related primarily to landlord tenant allowances for new stores and income tax refunds  and higher deferred tax asset balances primarily related to fixed assets  along with reduced net income  partially offset by the positive cash flow impact of higher accounts payable related to inventory purchases 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflected higher net income for the year  lower receivables due to the timing of settlement of credit card receivables  and increases in accrued expenses  offset by a reduced cash flow benefit resulting from lowered inventory levels 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures  excluding non cash acquisitions  represented substantially all of the net cash used in investing activities for each period 
our capital spending is primarily for new store openings  store related remodeling  distribution center and corporate headquarters costs and computer 
table of contents hardware and software purchases 
capital expenditures by category for each of the last three fiscal years are as follows fiscal year dollars in thousands new stores store related remodels distribution center computer hardware  software and other total capital spending in fiscal was more consistent with historical levels of spending reflecting the resumption of our new store expansion program 
capital spending levels in fiscal were lower due to substantially fewer new store openings as a result of efforts to conserve capital in response to the economic recession 
our capital expenditures included new stores and four relocations in fiscal  three new stores in fiscal  and new stores and one relocation in fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal  and also included amounts related to the implementation of computer system improvements and enhanced security measures to support our infrastructure 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities for fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
for fiscal  we continued to use cash provided from operating activities to pay down borrowings from our revolving credit facility  pay dividends and make lease payments 
the lower paydown of borrowings under our revolving credit facility in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily reflects this year s increased funding of inventory purchases along with the resumption of our new store expansion program after scaling back such investments in fiscal in response to the recession 
for fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was used to pay down a significant portion of borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we reduced our quarterly dividend payments to per share and did not repurchase stock in fiscal  in order to preserve capital 
for fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was used to pay down borrowings under our revolving credit facility  repurchase stock and pay dividends 
as of january   we had revolving credit borrowings of million and letter of credit commitments of million outstanding 
these balances compare to borrowings of million and letter of credit commitments of million outstanding as of january  our revolving credit facility balances have historically increased from the end of the first quarter to the end of the second quarter and from the end of the third quarter to the week of thanksgiving 
the historical increases in our revolving credit facility balances reflect the build up of inventory in anticipation of our summer and winter selling seasons 
revolving credit facility balances typically fall from the week of thanksgiving to the end of the fourth quarter  reflecting inventory sales during the holiday and winter selling season 
quarterly dividend payments of per share were paid in fiscal due to the economic recession  in the first quarter of fiscal our board of directors reduced the quarterly cash dividend to per share of outstanding common stock for an annual rate of per share  and quarterly dividend payments of per share were paid in fiscal and fiscal this decision was consistent with our objective to utilize capital to maintain a healthy financial condition during the economic recession 
in the first quarter of fiscal  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of outstanding common stock  which will be paid on march  to stockholders of record as of march  periodically  we repurchase our common stock in the open market pursuant to programs approved by our board of directors 
depending on business conditions  we may repurchase our common stock for a variety of reasons  including the current market price of our stock  to offset dilution related to equity based compensation plans and to optimize our capital structure 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our board of directors authorized an additional share repurchase program for the purchase of up to million of our common stock 
under the authorization  we may purchase 
table of contents shares from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in compliance with the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission sec 
however  the timing and amount of such purchases  if any  would be at the discretion of management  and would depend upon market conditions and other considerations 
in light of the economic climate  we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under this program during fiscal or fiscal we repurchased  and  shares of our common stock under this program for million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
since the inception of our initial share repurchase program in may through january   we have repurchased a total of  shares for million  leaving a total of million available for share repurchases under our current share repurchase program 
credit agreement 
on october   we terminated a financing agreement with the cit group business credit  inc cit and a syndicate of other lenders  as amended the prior financing agreement  and replaced it with a new credit agreement the new credit agreement with wells fargo bank  national association wells fargo  as administrative agent  and a syndicate of other lenders 
initial borrowings under the new credit agreement on october  were used to  among other things  repay all of our outstanding indebtedness under the prior financing agreement with cit  at which time the prior financing agreement was terminated

the new credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility the credit facility with an aggregate committed availability of up to million  which amount may be increased at our option up to a maximum of million 
we may also request additional increases in aggregate availability  up to a maximum of million  in which case the existing lenders under the new credit agreement will have the option to increase their commitments to accommodate the requested increase 
if such existing lenders do not exercise that option  we may with the consent of wells fargo  not to be unreasonably withheld seek other lenders willing to provide such commitments 
the credit facility includes a million sublimit for issuances of letters of credit and a million sublimit for swingline loans 
we may borrow under the credit facility from time to time  provided the amounts outstanding will not exceed the lesser of the then aggregate availability as described above and the borrowing base such lesser amount being referred to as the loan cap

generally  we may designate specific borrowings under the credit facility as either base rate loans or libo rate loans 
in each case  the applicable interest rate will be a function of the daily average  over the preceding fiscal quarter  of the excess of the loan cap over amounts outstanding under the credit facility such amount being referred to as the average daily excess availability 
those loans designated as libo rate loans shall bear interest at a rate equal to the then applicable libo rate plus an applicable margin as shown in the table below

all amounts outstanding under the credit facility will mature and become due on october  we may prepay any amounts outstanding at any time  subject to payment of certain breakage and redeployment costs relating to libo rate loans 
the commitments under the credit facility may be irrevocably reduced or terminated by us at any time without premium or penalty 
if at any time the aggregate amount of the loans outstanding under the credit facility  together with letters of credit  exceeds the loan cap as of that date  then we must immediately repay loans and  if necessary thereafter  cash collateralize letters of credit in an aggregate amount equal to such excess 
our new credit agreement contains covenants that limit our ability to  among other things  incur liens  incur additional indebtedness  transfer or dispose of assets  change the nature of the business  guarantee obligations  pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase stock  and make advances  loans or investments 
in addition  if at any time the excess of the loan cap over amounts outstanding under the credit facility the excess availability falls below of the loan cap  we must maintain a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the new credit agreement  calculated monthly on a trailing twelve months basis  of not less than  until such time as excess availability has equaled or exceeded of the loan cap at all times for consecutive calendar days 
we may declare or pay cash dividends or repurchase stock only if i no default or event of default then exists or would arise from such dividend or repurchase of stock  ii after giving effect to such payment  adjusted excess availability an amount equal to the borrowing base minus the outstanding amount of loans and letters of credit on a pro forma basis is projected to be equal to or greater than million for the immediately following days  iii after giving effect to such payment  excess availability on a pro forma basis is projected to be equal to or greater than million for the immediately following days  and iv after giving effect to such payment  the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio on a pro forma basis for the immediately preceding fiscal months is greater than the new credit agreement contains customary events of default  including  without limitation  failure to pay when due principal amounts with respect to the credit facility  failure to pay any interest or other amounts under the credit facility for five days after becoming due  failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants contained in the new credit agreement  failure to satisfy certain judgments against us  failure to pay when due or any other default which does or may lead to the acceleration of certain other material indebtedness in principal amount in excess of million  and certain insolvency and bankruptcy events

the following table provides information about our revolving credit borrowings as of and for the periods indicated fiscal year dollars in thousands fiscal year end balance average interest rate maximum outstanding during the year average outstanding during the year future capital requirements 
we had cash and cash equivalents on hand of million at january  we expect capital expenditures for fiscal  excluding non cash acquisitions  to range from approximately million to million  primarily to fund the opening of new stores  store related remodeling  distribution center equipment and computer hardware and software purchases 
in light of the economic recession experienced in fiscal and  we slowed our store expansion efforts substantially in fiscal  and resumed our expansion in fiscal in anticipation of an improved economic environment 
we anticipate opening between and net new stores in fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  our board of directors reduced our quarterly cash dividend to per share of outstanding common stock  for an annual rate of per share which was paid in fiscal and in the first quarter of fiscal  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of outstanding common stock  which will be paid on march  to stockholders of record as of march  as of february   a total of million remained available for share repurchases under our share repurchase program 
we consider several factors in determining when and if we make share repurchases including  among other things  our alternative cash requirements  existing business conditions and the market price of our stock 
due to the economic recession  we discontinued share repurchases in fiscal and fiscal we believe we will be able to fund our cash requirements  for at least the next twelve months  from cash and cash equivalents on hand  operating cash flows and borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
however  our ability to satisfy our cash requirements depends upon our future performance  which in turn is subject to general economic conditions and regional risks  and to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  including factors beyond our control 
there is no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our obligations and commitments  or if we are unable to maintain our ability to borrow sufficient amounts under our new credit agreement  we will be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness or raise additional debt or equity capital 
additionally  we may be required to sell material assets or operations  suspend or further reduce dividend payments or delay or forego expansion opportunities 
we might not be able to implement successful alternative strategies on satisfactory terms  if at all
