item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion together with selected consolidated financial data  and the historical financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the statements in this discussion regarding industry outlook  our expectations regarding our future performance  liquidity and capital resources and other non historical statements in this discussion are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the risks and uncertainties described in part i item a risk factors 
our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward looking statements 
we operate on a fiscal calendar widely used by the retail industry that results in a given fiscal year consisting of a or week period ending on the saturday closest to january of the following year 
for example  references to fiscal year refer to the fiscal year ended january  our fiscal year consisted of a week period and ended on february  overview rue is a fast growing specialty apparel retailer offering the newest fashion trends for girls and guys at value prices 
we were originally founded in as a value focused specialty apparel retailer 
in  we were acquired by certain funds now advised by apax partners  through skm equity fund ii  lp and skm investment fund ii 
in  our current president and chief executive officer  bob fisch  joined us 
upon his hiring  bob fisch began repositioning our company by aligning our stores under one brand name  strengthening our management team  honing our fashion value merchandise approach and refocusing our store growth strategy 
in late  we introduced our larger rue etc store layout  which averages approximately  square feet and features a separate store in store for our rue etc girls jewelry and accessories category 
as of january   we operated stores in states  of which featured the larger rue etc store layout 
our strong growth and operating results reflect the initiatives taken by our management team  as well as the increasing acceptance of our brand and merchandise 
our net sales increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  a compound annual growth rate of 
over the same period  we grew income from operations from million to million  a compound annual growth rate of 
since the beginning of fiscal year  we have increased our store base from stores to stores as of january  our total square footage growth has outpaced our total store growth over this same period  reflecting the increasing size of our average store 
we expect to continue our strong growth in the future 
we believe there is a significant opportunity to grow our store base to more than  stores 
we plan to open stores in fiscal year we also plan to continue to convert our existing stores into the larger rue etc layout  which allows us to offer an increased proportion of higher margin categories  such as accessories  intimate apparel  footwear and fragrances 
we converted stores to the rue etc layout in fiscal year and plan to convert stores in fiscal year we expect to continue to drive our comparable store sales by increasing the penetration of our newer product categories  increasing our brand awareness  continuing to provide our distinctive in store experience and converting stores to the rue etc layout 
our growth in total square footage is supported by our store economics  which we believe to be very attractive 
as a result of our low store build out costs  favorable lease terms and low cost operating model  our stores generate strong returns on investment 
we focus our real estate strategy on strip centers  regional malls and outlet centers  primarily in small and middle market communities  which we believe are underserved by traditional junior and young men s specialty apparel retailers 
our typical new store investment is approximately  which includes build out costs  net of landlord tenant allowances and initial inventory  net of payables 
new stores generate on average between  and million in net sales per store in the first twelve months 
however  new stores opened in the future may not generate similar net sales in the first twelve months or pay back our investment in a similar time period 
we continue to invest the capital necessary to build our infrastructure and support our future growth 
in we initiated expansion plans at our corporate headquarters in warrendale  pennsylvania  and in we will be 
table of contents expanding the footprint of our distribution facility in weirton  west virginia 
we also continue to invest in our systems infrastructure  including implementation of the latest store merchandising  supply chain  financial and real estate applications 
we believe our business strategy will continue to offer significant opportunity  but it also presents risks and challenges 
these risks and challenges include that we may not be able to effectively identify and respond to changing fashion trends and customer preferences  that we may not be able to find desirable locations in strip centers and regional malls or that we may not be able to effectively manage our operations which have grown rapidly  or our future growth 
we seek to ensure that addressing these risks does not divert our management s attention from continuing to build on the strengths that we believe have driven the growth of our business 
we believe our focus on maintaining the desirability of our products to our customers  maintaining and scaling our supply chain resources and improving our in store shopping experience and our customer service will contribute to our ongoing success 
how we assess the performance of our business in assessing the performance of our business  we consider a variety of performance and financial measures 
the key measures for determining how our business is performing are net sales  comparable store and non comparable store sales  gross profit margin and selling  general and administrative expense 
net sales net sales constitute gross sales net of any returns and merchandise discounts 
net sales consist of sales from comparable stores and non comparable stores 
comparable store sales a store is included in comparable store sales on the first day of the sixteenth month after its opening  as new stores generally open with above run rate sales volumes  which usually extend for a period of at least three months  and comparability generally is achieved twelve months after the initial three month period after store opening 
comparable store sales include existing stores that have been converted to our rue etc layout 
when a store that is included in comparable store sales is in the process of being converted to our rue etc layout  net sales from that store remain in comparable store sales 
there may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other apparel retailers calculate comparable or same store sales 
as a result  data in this annual report on form k regarding our comparable store sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by other retailers 
non comparable store sales include sales not included in comparable store sales and sales from closed stores 
measuring the change in year over year comparable store sales allows us to evaluate how our store base is performing 
various factors affect comparable store sales  including consumer preferences  buying trends and overall economic trends  our ability to identify and respond effectively to fashion trends and customer preferences  competition  changes in our merchandise mix  pricing  the timing of our releases of new merchandise and promotional events  the level of customer service that we provide in our stores  our ability to source and distribute products efficiently  and the number of stores we open  close and convert in any period 

table of contents as we continue to pursue our store growth strategy  we expect that a significant percentage of our net sales increase will continue to come from non comparable store sales 
opening new stores is an important part of our growth strategy 
accordingly  comparable store sales is only one element we use to assess the success of our growth strategy 
the retail apparel industry is cyclical  and consequently our net sales are affected by general economic conditions 
purchases of apparel and accessories are sensitive to a number of factors that influence the levels of consumer spending  including economic conditions and the level of disposable consumer income  consumer debt  interest rates and consumer confidence 
our business is seasonal and as a result  our net sales fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
net sales are usually higher in the second through fourth fiscal quarters  and particularly in the months of august and december  as customers make back to school and holiday purchases 
gross profit gross profit is equal to our net sales minus our cost of goods sold 
gross margin measures gross profit as a percentage of our net sales 
cost of goods sold includes the direct cost of purchased merchandise  distribution center costs  all freight costs incurred to get merchandise to our stores  store occupancy costs and buying costs 
the components of our cost of goods sold may not be comparable to those of other retailers 
our cost of goods sold is substantially higher in higher volume quarters because cost of goods sold generally increases as net sales increase 
changes in the mix of our products  such as changes in the proportion of accessories  may also impact our overall cost of goods sold 
we review our inventory levels on an ongoing basis in order to identify slow moving merchandise  and generally use markdowns to clear that merchandise 
the timing and level of markdowns are not seasonal in nature but are driven by customer acceptance of our merchandise 
if we misjudge the market for our products  we may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and be required to mark down those products in order to sell them 
significant markdowns have reduced our gross profit in some prior periods and may have a material adverse impact on our earnings for future periods depending on the amount of the markdowns and the amount of merchandise affected 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense includes administration  stock based compensation and store expenses but excludes store occupancy costs and freight to stores 
these expenses do not generally vary proportionally with net sales 
as a result  selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales is usually higher in lower volume quarters and lower in higher volume quarters 
the components of our selling  general and administrative expense may not be comparable to those of other retailers 
we expect that our selling  general and administrative expense will increase in future periods due to our continuing store growth and has increased significantly in fiscal due to additional legal  accounting  insurance and other expenses we incurred as a result of being a public company and compliance with the sarbanes oxley act and related rules and regulations

liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is cash flows from operations 
our primary cash needs are generally for capital expenditures incurred in connection with the opening of new stores  the conversion of existing stores  and for the related increase in merchandise inventories 
cash is also required for investment in information technology and distribution facility enhancements and funding normal working capital requirements 
the most significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents  merchandise inventories  accounts payable and other current liabilities 
our working capital position benefits from the fact that we generally collect cash from sales to customers the same day or  in the case of credit or debit card transactions  within several days of the related sale  and we typically have up to to days to pay our vendors 

table of contents as of january   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
our cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit and credit and debit card transactions 
our cash and cash equivalents balance at january  increased by million from million at january  components of this change in cash for fiscal year  as well as for change in cash for the fiscal years and  are provided below in more detail

net cash was reduced for additional merchandise inventory required by operations of million 
during fiscal year  we generated million in cash from operating activities  as compared to million in fiscal year  an increase of million 
this increase in cash from operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in net income of million  which includes the one time termination fee of million paid to apax  an increase in non cash depreciation and amortization of million  which reflects our increased level of cumulative capital investments over the past several fiscal years and improvements in our requirements for merchandise inventory of million as compared to fiscal year in addition  other working capital components increased by million due to increases in accrued expenses and in tenant allowances received from landlords as a result of new store openings 
these cash inflows and improvements were offset by reduction in the level of accounts payable  which decreased our cash from operating activities by million as compared to fiscal year

we completed our initial public offering ipo on november   which resulted in net proceeds to us of million after deducting underwriters discounts and commissions 
we incurred legal and other costs related to our ipo of approximately million  which is included as a reduction of additional paid in capital 
we used the net proceeds to us from the ipo to repay the million outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities

table of contents in the borrowing ceiling to million from million  which is further expandable at our option in increments of million up to a maximum of million under certain defined conditions 
interest accrues at the higher of the federal funds rate plus  the prime rate or the adjusted libor rate plus plus the applicable margin which ranges from to

our senior secured credit facility includes a fixed charge covenant applicable only if net availability falls below a threshold 
we are in compliance with all covenants under our senior secured credit facility as of january  and expect to remain in compliance for the next twelve months 
we believe that our cash position  net cash provided by operating activities and availability under our senior secured credit facility will be adequate to finance working capital needs and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
off balance sheet arrangements we are not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of january  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations merchandise inventory purchase commitments excludes common area maintenance cam charges  real estate taxes and certain other expenses which amounted to approximately of minimum lease obligations in fiscal year which we expect to be consistent for the next three years 
impact of inflation our results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost 
while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required  we believe the effects of inflation  if any  on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition have been immaterial 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses 
management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable given the circumstances and evaluates these 
table of contents estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended january  for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
the following reflect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon purchase of merchandise by customers 
allowances for sales returns are recorded as a reduction of sales in the periods in which the sales are recognized 
deferred revenue is established upon the purchase of gift cards by customers  and revenue is recognized upon redemption of gift cards for merchandise 
inventory valuation we value merchandise inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or market using the retail inventory method 
we record merchandise receipts at the time they are delivered to our consolidator  as we do not directly import any merchandise 
this is the point at which title and risk of loss transfer to us 
we review our inventory levels to identify slow moving merchandise and generally use markdowns to clear slow moving merchandise 
we record a markdown reserve based on estimated future markdowns related to current inventory 
each period we evaluate the selling trends experienced and the related promotional events or pricing strategies in place to sell through the current inventory levels 
markdowns may occur when inventory exceeds customer demand for reasons of style  seasonal adaptation  changes in customer preference  lack of consumer acceptance of fashion items  competition  or if it is determined that the inventory in stock will not sell at its currently ticketed price 
such markdowns may have an adverse impact on earnings  depending on the extent and amount of inventory affected 
the anticipated deployment of new seasonal merchandise is reflected within the estimated future markdowns reserve used in valuing current inventory  as such new inventory in certain circumstances will displace merchandise units currently on hand 
the markdown reserve is recorded as an increase to cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income 
we also estimate a shrinkage reserve for the period of time between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 
the estimate for shrinkage reserve can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrinkage trends 
asset impairment we are exposed to potential impairment if the book value of our assets exceeds their expected future cash flows 
the major components of our long lived assets are store fixtures  equipment and leasehold improvements 
we have recognized impairment charges related to store conversions and may recognize impairment charges in the future 
the impairment of unamortized costs is measured at the store level and the unamortized cost is reduced to fair value if it is determined that the sum of expected undiscounted future net cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets is less than net book value 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb  which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between our consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates  based on certain judgments regarding enacted tax laws and published guidance  in effect in the years when those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred taxes may not be realized 
changes in the level and composition of earnings  tax laws or the deferred tax valuation allowance  as well as the results of tax audits may materially impact our effective tax rate 

table of contents we recognize income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with the fasb s authoritative guidance related to uncertain tax positions and adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as the result of the evaluation of new information 
we classify interest and penalties as an element of tax expense 
the calculation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities  as well as the decision to recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain position and to establish a valuation allowance require management to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that our assumptions and estimates are reasonable  although actual results may have a positive or negative material impact on the balances of deferred tax assets and liabilities  valuation allowances  or net income 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fasb s authoritative guidance for stock based compensation 
under this guidance  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
the black scholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility  expected option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
the expected volatility reflects the application of sab topic s interpretive guidance and  accordingly  incorporates historical volatility of similar entities whose share prices are publicly available 
the expected option life reflects the application of the simplified method set out in sab topic the simplified method defines the life as the average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted average vesting period for all option tranches 
the risk free interest rate is based on year us treasury instruments whose maturities are similar to those of the expected term of the award being valued 
the expected dividend yield was based on our expectation of not paying dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience 
further  to the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate  stock based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly 
prior to our initial public offering on november   all stock based awards granted to employees had been incentive stock options isos 
the recipient of an iso must hold the underlying shares for at least two years from the date of grant and one year from the date of exercise in order to receive favorable capital gains tax treatment on any profit realized from the sale of those shares 
if this holding period is not met  a disqualifying disposition has occurred and all or a portion of the profit realized by the individual is taxed at ordinary income tax rates 
if we include this profit in an individual s taxable compensation  then we can deduct it as compensation expense on our corporate tax return 
these benefits are generally recorded as a reduction to income taxes payable 
under the fasb s authoritative guidance  we account for any disqualifying dispositions under the individual award method 
we do not expect that the application of this method to our accounting for disqualifying dispositions related to isos currently outstanding will materially affect our provision for income taxes or our effective tax rate for the foreseeable future 
subsequent to our initial public offering  all director and employee stock option grants have been non qualified options and restricted stock options 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance in connection with adding qualified special purpose entities into the scope of guidance for consolidation of variable interest entities 
this literature also modifies the analysis by which a controlling interest of a variable interest entity is determined thereby requiring the controlling interest to consolidate the variable interest entity 
a controlling interest exists if a party to a variable interest entity has both i the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and ii the obligation to absorb losses of or receive benefits from the entity that could be potentially significant to the variable interest entity 
the guidance is effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning after november  and will be applied prospectively for interim and annual periods upon adoption 
the company has adopted the guidance without any impact on the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu 
asu amends the fasb s authoritative guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures to require additional disclosures related to transfers between levels in the hierarchy of fair value measurements 
asu is effective for interim and annual fiscal years beginning after december  the standard does not change how fair values are measured 
the company has adopted the guidance without any impact on the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal market risk relates to interest rate sensitivity  which is the risk that future changes in interest rates will reduce our net income or net assets 
our senior secured credit facility accrues interest at the bank of america na base rate  defined at our option as the prime rate or the eurodollar rate plus applicable margin  which ranges from to set quarterly dependent upon average net availability under our senior secured credit facility during the previous quarter
