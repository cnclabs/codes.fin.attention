item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview emeritus is one of the nation s largest providers of assisted living and alzheimer s memory care services 
as of december   we operated communities in states 
fiscal in review the year was marked by signs of a modest recovery from the united states and global economic recession and turmoil in the financial and housing markets that began in despite these challenging economic conditions  we demonstrated the resilient  need driven nature of our primarily assisted living business by posting positive operating numbers while many senior living industry metrics edged somewhat lower 
we continued to execute our business strategy  which is discussed in detail in 
business business strategy  in this form k 
our business fundamentals remain consistent  as evidenced by growth in revenue  revenue per unit  average occupancy rate  and operating income growth in our same community portfolio as defined below in 
same community portfolio analysis 
for  we recorded a net loss attributable to our common shareholders of million compared to net losses of million for and million for operating income from continuing operations  which excludes interest  net equity earnings or losses  and other non operating items  was million for compared to operating income of million for and an operating loss of  for total operating revenues increased to billion for from million for and million for two of the important factors affecting our financial results are the rates we charge our residents and the occupancy levels we achieve in our communities 
we rely primarily on our residents ability to pay our rates for services from their own or family resources and expect that we will do so for the foreseeable future 
although care in an assisted living community is typically less expensive than in a skilled nursing facility  we believe that only residents with income or assets meeting or exceeding the regional median can afford to reside in our communities 
in this context  we must be sensitive to our residents financial circumstances and remain aware that rates and occupancy levels are interrelated 
in evaluating the rate component  we utilize the average monthly revenue per occupied unit  computed by dividing the total operating revenue for a particular period by the average number of occupied units for the same period 
in evaluating the occupancy component  we generally utilize an average occupancy rate  computed by dividing the average units occupied during a particular period by the average number of units available during the period 
we evaluate these and other operating components for our consolidated and operated portfolios 
key annual metrics of our consolidated portfolio include year ended december  average monthly revenue per occupied unit dollar change from previous year percentage change from previous year average occupancy rate percentage point change from previous year ppt ppt ppt occupancy rate increases from to reflect a combination of factors  including local market conditions  competition  changes in required level of care provided to residents  and acquisitions 
the occupancy rates increased despite the general economic downturn in recent years 
we continue to evaluate the factors of rate and occupancy to find the optimum balance in each community

key annual metrics of our same community portfolio include year ended december  d d average monthly revenue per occupied unit average occupancy rate ppt key quarterly metrics of our same community portfolio include three months ended december  d d average monthly revenue per occupied unit average occupancy rate ppt we also earn management fee revenues by managing communities for third parties  including joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest 
some of our management agreements provide for a flat monthly rate  are based on the number of resident days  or provide fees ranging from to of gross operating revenues  some with mandatory minimum thresholds 
the majority of our management agreements  of  provide for fees of of gross revenues collected 
terms of our management agreements range from two to five years and may be renewed or renegotiated at the expiration of the term 
during  we entered into the sunwest jv  which acquired communities 
as of december   we manage of those communities  which consist of approximately  units 
in the fourth quarter of  we also entered into a lease with hcp  inc for a total of senior living communities 
overall  we increased our consolidated portfolio during by communities  representing approximately  units 
additionally  we increased our operated portfolio during by communities  representing approximately  units 
in november  we sold an aggregate of  shares of emeritus common stock for net proceeds of million after issuance costs 
we used part of these proceeds to pay off two loans to one lender in the amount of million  as required in the relevant loan agreements  and the remaining cash will be used for acquisitions and other corporate purposes 
in addition  during  we refinanced  retired  or extended approximately million of other long term debt obligations that were scheduled to mature during and since emeritus corporation s inception in  we have incurred cumulative operating losses totaling approximately million as of december  we believe that these losses have resulted from our early emphasis on expansion  financing costs arising from multiple financing and refinancing transactions related to this expansion  administrative and corporate expenses that we incurred in anticipation of further expansion and increased emphasis on risk management and financial reporting controls  the impact in the early years on many of our leases from capital and financing lease treatments  and occupancy rates remaining lower for longer periods than we 
table of contents emeritus corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued years ended december    and anticipated 
while we have generally realized growth in both our occupancy and average monthly rates  we anticipate continued losses in the near term until such time as our occupancy stabilizes 
our current emphasis is on maximization of cash flows and cost containment as we work toward improvements in occupancy and average rates  selective growth  and changes in our capital structure  such as acquisition of leased properties and refinancing of existing debt 
looking ahead to although there is some evidence that the economic recession has ended  we cannot predict future economic conditions or their impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
however  we continue to believe that the needs driven nature of our business  potential pent up demand and reduced supply of new senior housing construction in our sector will support improved operating performance  especially if combined with economic recovery 
we will continue to focus on the fundamentals of occupancy and rate growth as well as efficiency and expense control 
we have spent the past few years implementing scalable structures and systems to better monitor and manage our key business drivers and believe that we are in a position to absorb additional capacity without significant changes to our overhead structure 
as part of our long term strategy  we intend to continue to selectively pursue acquisitions 
our portfolios as of december   our consolidated portfolio had a capacity of approximately  beds in states  and our operated portfolio had a capacity of approximately  beds in states

significant transactions during   and  we entered into a number of transactions that affected the number of communities we own  lease  and manage  our financing arrangements  and our capital structure 
in the three years ended december   our most significant transaction affecting the number of communities we manage was our participation in the sunwest jv 
in january  the company and affiliates of blackstone and columbia pacific entered into the sunwest jv to acquire a portfolio of communities operated by sunwest 
during  the sunwest jv purchased properties for an aggregate purchase price of approximately billion  and the consideration included i approximately million in a combination of cash and membership interests in the sunwest jv and ii the assumption by the sunwest jv of secured debt of approximately million 
the sunwest jv was capitalized with approximately million in cash and million in rollover equity contributed by former sunwest investors 
our initial contribution was million 
under the terms of the joint venture agreement  blackstone  columbia pacific  and emeritus are required to contribute an additional million in cash by august for capital improvement projects  of which our proportional share is expected to be million 
our percentage ownership interest in the sunwest jv  including the additional million  is 
the joint venture agreement provides for cash distributions from the sunwest jv to the members in accordance with their ownership interests  however  we are entitled to distributions at increasing levels in excess of our ownership percentage if certain portfolio performance criteria are achieved 
in addition  in the event that blackstone decides to sell properties or its membership interest  the joint venture agreement provides us the right of first opportunity to purchase the communities or blackstone s membership interest at fair value  and includes a profit sharing provision for us if the sunwest jv s internal rate of return exceeds established thresholds

the increase of million from the communities in our same community portfolio as defined below in 
same community portfolio analysis consisted of million in rate improvement and million in occupancy gains 
although the average occupancy rate in our same community portfolio for was relatively flat compared to  the number of residents increased due to more residents opting for companion living arrangements  particularly in our memory care units 
this contributed to the increase in revenues  as did increased required levels of resident care 
we continue to focus on achieving the optimal rate in each of our markets so that we can benefit from our increasing capacity and anticipated future occupancy increases 
although our business is primarily needs driven  we believe that our occupancy growth has been slowed due to the recent economic recession  as some seniors and their families have postponed moves for financial reasons  and we believe that high unemployment has enabled family members and others to provide home care for seniors 
revenues from communities not in our same community portfolio increased by million due to acquisitions during the change in unallocated community revenue of million resulted primarily from an increase in the deferral of revenue for resident move in fees  which we recognize over the average resident stay 
our management fee agreement with the sunwest jv  which began in august  contributed million to management fee revenues in we expect the sunwest jv s revenues  and thus our management fees  to increase in the future as its occupancy and rates stabilize 
the blackstone jv  for which we manage communities  contributed million and million to management fees in the years ended december  and  respectively

the increase of million from the same community portfolio included a million increase in total labor and benefits  of which payroll taxes increased million  and salaries and wages expense increased million  or  as compared to these increases were offset primarily by lower health insurance expenses that resulted from changes we made to our health insurance plan during most of the increase in salaries and wages was due to the increase in the number of residents compared to the prior year  necessitating additional staffing 
salaries and wages in our same community portfolio on a per resident day basis increased by 
the remaining increase of million in same community operating expense was due to increases in maintenance  raw food  bad debt  real estate taxes  contracted services  and other general expense increases across various operating expense categories 
we believe that the increases in bad debt  payroll taxes  and real estate taxes were  to some extent  impacted by the recent recession  as some residents and their children encountered financial difficulties and local government agencies increased taxes in response to revenue shortfalls 
community operating expense increased million from acquisitions during the largest contributor was an increase in total labor and benefits of million 
the million increase in unallocated community expenses was attributable primarily to self insurance reserve adjustments 
we periodically adjust our estimated self insurance liabilities based on actuarial projected losses  representing our revised estimates of the ultimate exposure under our self insurance programs 
during  we recorded million in expenses for professional and general self insurance for changes in estimates of open prior year claims exposure while during we recorded million in expense reductions 
these changes in estimates were based on actuarial valuation reports

for a detailed discussion of these impairments and how they were calculated  see 
notes to consolidated financial statements note  fair value measurements  in this form k 
we test goodwill for impairment annually and more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate goodwill carrying values exceed the estimated fair value of the company

the increased depreciation expense was due primarily to a net increase of communities added to our consolidated portfolio that we accounted for as capital or financing leases as well as an increase in owned communities and expansions of existing communities 
the decrease of million in amortization expense from million during to million during was due primarily to the in place resident contract intangible asset acquired in our acquisition of summerville in september this asset was fully amortized in the first quarter of and accounted for million of the expense

liquidity and capital resources the united states economy experienced a significant decline in the housing market  significant declines in consumer confidence  and a related weakness in the availability and affordability of credit during that led to the economic recession that continued throughout with only moderate signs of a recovery in we believe that the recovery is likely to continue to be slow throughout however  we believe that the need driven demand for our services continues to grow and remains resilient due  in large part  to an increasingly aging population as well as limited new senior living construction  as evidenced by our relative stability in occupancy and improvements in cash flows 
at december   we had cash on hand of million compared to million at december  the company has incurred significant operating losses since its inception  and we had working capital deficits of million and million at december  and  respectively 
due to the nature of our business  it is not unusual to operate in the position of a working capital deficit because we collect revenues much more quickly  often in advance  than we are required to pay obligations 
the result is a very low level of current assets to the extent cash has been deployed in business development opportunities or to pay down long term liabilities 
along those lines  the working capital deficit at december  included a million deferred tax asset and  as part of current liabilities  million of deferred revenue and unearned rental income 
the level of current liabilities is not expected to increase from year to year in such a way as to require the use of significant cash  except for million and million in final payments of principal on long term debt maturing in and  respectively 
we intend to refinance or retire these and obligations prior to their respective due dates 
given the unprecedented instability in worldwide credit markets  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such refinancing or be able to retire the obligations 
see the section

we believe that we will be able to sustain positive cash flows from operating activities or have adequate cash reserves for all necessary operating  investing  and financing activities including required debt service and capital expenditures through sources and uses of cash the following is a summary of information from our consolidated statements of cash flows for the three years ended december  in thousands year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the year cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year

the increase for reflects improvements in cash flows in our same community portfolio and cash generated from new acquisitions 
both and were positively impacted by purchasing the real estate underlying leased communities  whereby we replaced lease payments with lower levels of debt service and also avoided future scheduled lease escalators 
the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to our million investment in the sunwest jv  offset by a decrease in cash used for acquisitions of property and equipment 
in  we paid million to purchase communities and million for other capital expenditures  of which million was used for routine  recurring capital expenditures and the remainder was used for investments in recently acquired communities and corporate expenditures 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities is due to our november public offering of common stock  which provided net proceeds of million after issuance costs 
we used million of the proceeds to pay off two loans  as required in the relevant loan agreements 
we plan to use the remaining proceeds for acquisitions and other corporate purposes 
in  we borrowed million to finance the purchase of three communities and used million in cash for repayment of capital leases  debt  and financing costs 
at december   the company had payment obligations for long term debt and capital leases due in the next months totaling approximately million 
in addition  during  we refinanced or extended approximately million of other long term debt obligations 
emeritus is party to a credit agreement with wells fargo bank  na  which permits us to borrow from time to time up to million on an unsecured basis 
the credit agreement also allows us to obtain letters of credit from the lender  provided that outstanding letters of credit and any borrowings outstanding do not exceed million 
we must maintain a zero balance on advances for consecutive days during each fiscal year and a fixed charge coverage ratio of to in addition  we must maintain liquid assets cash  cash equivalents and or publicly traded marketable securities with an aggregate fair value of at least million in excess of the outstanding balance at any time under the line of credit

financial covenants and cross defaults many of our debt instruments  leases  and corporate guarantees contain financial covenants that require that the company maintain specified financial criteria as of the end of each reporting period 
these financial covenants generally prescribe operating performance metrics such as debt or lease coverage ratios  operating income yields  fixed charge coverage ratios and or minimum occupancy requirements 
others are based on financial metrics such as minimum cash or net worth balances or have material adverse change clauses 
remedies available to the counterparties to these arrangements in the event of default vary but include the requirement to post a security deposit in specified amounts  acceleration of debt or lease payments  and or the termination of related lease agreements 
in addition  many of the lease and debt instruments contain cross default provisions whereby a default under one obligation can cause a default under one or more other obligations 
accordingly  an event of default could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition if a lender or landlord exercised its rights under an event of default 

table of contents emeritus corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued years ended december    and as of december   the company has approximately billion of mortgage debt and notes payable outstanding comprised of the following mortgage debt financed through freddie mac and fannie mae of approximately million  or approximately of our total debt outstanding 
these obligations were incurred to facilitate community acquisitions over the past few years  were issued to single purpose entities spes and are secured by the assets of the spe  which consists of the real and personal property and intangible assets of a single community 
the debt is generally nonrecourse debt to the company in that only the assets or common stock of the spe are available to the lender in the event of default  with some limited exceptions 
these debt obligations do not contain provisions requiring ongoing maintenance of specific financial covenants but do contain typical events of default such as nonpayment of monetary obligations  failure to maintain insurance coverage  fraud and or misrepresentation of facts  unauthorized sale or transfer of assets  and the commencement of legal proceedings under bankruptcy 
these debt instruments typically contain cross default provisions  which are limited to other related loans provided by the specific lender 
remedies under an event of default include the acceleration of payment of the related obligations 
mortgage debt financed primarily through traditional financial lending institutions of approximately million  or approximately of our total debt outstanding 
these obligations were incurred to facilitate community acquisitions over the past few years  were typically issued to spes and are secured by the assets of the spe  which consists of the real and personal property and intangible assets of a single community 
the debt is generally recourse debt to the company in that not only are the assets or common stock of the spe available to the lender in the event of default  but the company has guaranteed performance of the spe s obligations under the mortgage 
these debt obligations generally contain provisions requiring ongoing maintenance of specific financial covenants  such as debt service coverage ratios  operating income yields  occupancy requirements  and or net operating income thresholds 
the company guarantees generally contain requirements to maintain minimum cash and or net worth balances 
in addition  the mortgages contain other typical events of default such as nonpayment of monetary obligations  failure to maintain insurance coverage  fraud and or misrepresentation of facts  unauthorized sale or transfer of assets  and the commencement of legal proceedings under bankruptcy

mezzanine debt financing in the amount of million provided by real estate investment trusts reits to facilitate community acquisitions  or approximately of our total debt outstanding 
these obligations are generally unsecured or are secured by mortgages on leasehold interests in community lease agreements between the specific reit and the company  and performance under the debt obligations is guaranteed by the company 
the company guaranty generally contains a requirement to maintain minimum cash and or net worth balances 
typical events of default under these obligations include nonpayment of monetary obligations  events of default under related lease agreements  and the commencement of legal proceedings under bankruptcy 
remedies under an event of default include the acceleration of payments of the related obligations 
as of december   we operated communities under long term lease arrangements  of which were leased from publicly traded reits 
of the leased properties  contain provisions requiring ongoing maintenance of specific financial covenants  such as rent coverage ratios 
other typical events of default under these leases include nonpayment of rents or other monetary obligations  events of default under related lease agreements  and the commencement of legal proceedings under bankruptcy 
remedies in these events of default vary but generally include the requirement to post a security deposit in specified amounts  acceleration of lease payments  and or the termination of the related lease agreements 
additionally  our debt and lease agreements generally require us to escrow or spend a minimum of between and per unit bed per year for facility maintenance 
historically  we have spent in excess of these per unit bed 
table of contents emeritus corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued years ended december    and amounts  however  there is no assurance that we will have funds available to escrow or spend these per unit bed amounts in the future 
if we do not escrow or spend the required minimum annual amounts  we will be in default of the applicable debt or lease agreement  which could trigger cross default provisions in our outstanding debt and lease arrangements 
as of december   we were in violation of a financial covenant on one mortgage loan with a balance  as of december   of million 
we have obtained a waiver of this violation and plan to pay off or refinance this loan on or prior to its may  maturity date 
summary of critical accounting policies and use of estimates critical accounting policies are those that we believe are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in us reporting materially different amounts under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we believe that our accounting policies regarding investments in joint ventures  asset impairments  goodwill impairment  stock based compensation  leases  self insurance reserves  and income taxes are the most critical in understanding the judgments involved in our preparation of our financial statements 
those financial statements reflect our revisions to such estimates in income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision became known 
for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies  see 
notes to consolidated financial statements note description of the business  basis of presentation  and summary of significant accounting policies  in this form k 
investments in joint ventures we have investments in joint ventures with equity interests ranging from to 
generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires that at the time we enter into a joint venture  we must determine whether the joint venture is a variable interest entity and if so  whether we are the primary beneficiary and thus required to consolidate the entity 
in performing this analysis  we consider various factors such as the amount of our ownership interest  our voting rights  the extent of our power to direct matters that significantly impact the entity s activities  and our participating rights 
we must also reevaluate each joint venture s status quarterly or whenever there is a change in circumstances such an increase in the entity s activities  assets  or equity investments  among other things 
asset impairments when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets may not be recoverable  we evaluate long lived assets for impairment 
we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows undiscounted 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we calculate an impairment loss based on the asset s estimated fair value 
for community assets  the fair value of the assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on future revenues and operating costs  using internal projections 
for our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  we determine whether there has been an other than temporary decline in the carrying value of the investment by using a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of individual assets inside the joint venture 
for our investments in marketable equity securities  we must make a judgment as to whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary 
for other assets  we use the valuation approach that is appropriate given the relevant facts and circumstances 
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting asset useful lives 
further  our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying values of our assets is affected by 
table of contents emeritus corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued years ended december    and factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets  changes in economic conditions  and changes in operating performance 
as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values  changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future 
goodwill impairment we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if circumstances indicate that goodwill carrying values may exceed their fair values 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied estimated fair value  an impairment charge to current operations is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the implied estimated fair value 
we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test as of october  and concluded that no impairment charge was required 
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of our reporting unit  including estimating future cash flows  and if necessary  the fair value of our assets and liabilities 
further  our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as changes in economic conditions  changes in our operating performance  and changes in our business strategies 
as we periodically reassess our fair value calculations  including estimated future cash flows  changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future 
stock based compensation we measure the fair value of stock awards at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize the expense over the related service period 
for stock option awards  we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the expected dividend yield 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those stock awards expected to vest 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience 
changes in our assumptions could materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation  however  a change in our critical assumptions including volatility and expected term would not have a material impact for fiscal year leases we determine whether to account for our leases as operating  capital  or financing leases depending on the underlying terms 
as of december   we operated communities under long term leases with operating  capital  and financing lease obligations 
the determination of this classification under gaap is complex and in certain situations requires a significant level of judgment 
our classification criteria is based on estimates regarding the fair value of the leased communities  minimum lease payments  effective cost of funds  the economic life of the community  and certain other terms in the lease agreements 
self insurance reserves we use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms  including a wholly owned captive insurance entity  to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks  including workers compensation  healthcare benefits  professional and general liability  property insurance  and director and officers liability insurance 
liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by emeritus are estimated  in part  by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
we are self insured for professional liability risk with respect to of the communities in our consolidated 
table of contents emeritus corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued years ended december    and portfolio 
the liability for self insured incurred but not yet reported claims was million and million at december  and  respectively 
a change in the estimated liability at december  would have increased or decreased expenses during by approximately million 
we are self insured for workers compensation risk except in texas  washington  and ohio up to  per claim through a high deductible  collateralized insurance program 
the liability for self insured incurred but not yet reported claims was million and million at december  and  respectively 
a change in the estimated liability at december  would have increased or decreased expenses during by approximately million 
for health insurance  we self insure each covered member up to  per year  above which a catastrophic insurance policy covers any additional costs for certain participants 
the liability for self insured incurred but not yet reported claims is included in accrued employee compensation and benefits in the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at december  and  respectively 
a change in the estimated liability at december  would have increased or decreased expenses during by approximately  changes in self insurance reserves are recorded as an increase or decrease to expense in the period that the determination is made 
we share any revisions to prior estimates with the communities participating in the insurance programs  including those that we manage for third parties such as the sunwest jv  based on their proportionate share of any changes in estimates 
accordingly  the impact of changes in estimates on our income from operations would be much less sensitive than the differences indicated above 
in march  congress enacted health care reform legislation  referred to as the affordable care act aca  which we believe will increase our costs to provide healthcare benefits 
the specific provisions of the aca will be phased in over time through  unless modifying legislation is passed before some of the provisions become effective 
we are in the process of assessing the financial impact of aca on our company 
although there are additional expenses that will be incurred in  we do not expect that the aca will result in a material increase in our operating expenses in however  we could see significant cost increases beginning in when certain provisions of the legislation are required to be implemented 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse 
we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and record a valuation allowance if  based on all available evidence  we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized 
as of december   we have established a valuation allowance such that our net deferred tax asset is zero 
we evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and record a related liability 
we adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provision in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled  the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position  or when more information becomes available 
deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liability for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation  the status of various income tax audits  and our particular facts and circumstances 
we believe that our estimates are reasonable  however  actual results could differ from these estimates 

table of contents emeritus corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued years ended december    and impact of inflation inflation could affect our future revenues and operating income due to our dependence on the senior resident population  most of whom rely on relatively fixed incomes to pay for our services 
the monthly charges for the resident s unit and assisted living services are influenced by the location of the community and local competition 
our ability to increase revenues in proportion to increased operating expenses may be limited 
we typically do not rely to a significant extent on governmental reimbursement programs  which accounted for approximately of community revenues for the year ended december  in pricing our services  we attempt to anticipate inflation levels  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to respond to inflationary pressures in the future 
the near term negative economic outlook in the united states may impact our ability to raise prices 
in years ended december    and  respectively  inflation has not had a material impact on our financial position  revenues  income from continuing operations or cash flows 
we do not expect inflation affecting the us dollar to materially impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows in the foreseeable future 
non gaap measures a non gaap financial measure is generally defined as one that purports to measure historical financial position  results of operations  or cash flows but excludes or includes amounts that would not be included in most measures under gaap 
definition of adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as net loss adjusted for the following items as reported in 
consolidated statements of operations in this form k depreciation and amortization  interest income  interest expense  net equity earnings or losses for unconsolidated joint ventures  provision for benefit from income taxes  loss gain from discontinued operations  as reported in 
consolidated statements of cash flows in this form k amortization of above below market rents  loss on lease termination  amortization of deferred gains  stock based compensation  change in fair value of interest rate swaps  deferred revenue  deferred straight line rent  as well as the following specific expenses impairments of long lived assets continuing operations  acquisition  development  and financing expenses  and actuarial self insurance reserve adjustments 
definition of adjusted ebitdar we define adjusted ebitdar as adjusted ebitda plus community lease expense as reported in 
consolidated statements of operations in this form k  net of amortization of above below market rents and deferred straight line rent 

table of contents emeritus corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued years ended december    and management s use of adjusted ebitda ebitdar adjusted ebitda ebitdar are commonly used performance metrics in the senior living industry 
we use adjusted ebitda ebitdar to assess our overall financial and operating performance 
we believe these non gaap measures  as we have defined them  are useful in identifying trends in our financial performance because they exclude items that have little or no significance to our day to day operations 
these measures provide an assessment of controllable expenses and afford management the ability to make decisions  which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial goals  as well as achieve optimal financial performance 
these measures also provide indicators for management to determine if adjustments to current spending levels are needed 
adjusted ebitda ebitdar provide us with measures of financial performance  independent of items that are beyond the control of management in the short term  such as depreciation and amortization  taxation  interest expense  and lease expense associated with our capital structure 
these metrics measure our financial performance based on operational factors that management can influence in the short term  namely the cost structure or expenses of the organization 
adjusted ebitda ebitdar are some of the metrics used by senior management to review the financial performance of the business on a monthly basis and are used by research analysts and investors to evaluate the performance and value of the companies in our industry 
limitations of adjusted ebitda ebitdar adjusted ebitda ebitdar have limitations as analytical tools 
material limitations in making the adjustments to our losses to calculate adjusted ebitda ebitdar and using this non gaap financial measure as compared to gaap net loss include the items excluded from the calculation of adjusted ebitda ebitdar generally represent income or expense items that may have a significant effect on our financial results  items determined to be non recurring in nature could  nevertheless  re occur in the future  and depreciation and amortization  while not directly affecting our current cash position  does represent wear and tear and or reduction in value of our properties 
if the cost to maintain our properties exceeds our expected routine capital expenditures  then this could affect our ability to attract and retain long term residents at our communities 
an investor or potential investor may find this important in evaluating our financial position and results of operations 
we use these non gaap measures to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 
adjusted ebitda ebitdar are not alternatives to net loss  loss from continuing operations  or cash flows provided by or used in operating activities as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
you should not rely on adjusted ebitda ebitdar as substitutes for any such gaap financial measure 
we strongly urge you to review the reconciliation of gaap net loss to adjusted ebitda ebitdar presented below  along with our consolidated balance sheets  statements of operations  and statements of cash flows 
in addition  because adjusted ebitda ebitdar are not measures of financial performance under gaap and are susceptible to varying calculations  this measure as presented may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

recurring routine capital expenditures include expenditures capitalized in accordance with gaap that are funded from cffo 
amounts excluded from recurring routine capital expenditures consist primarily of community acquisitions  including expenditures incurred in the months immediately following acquisition  new construction and expansions  computer hardware and software purchases  and purchases of vehicles 
management s use of cash from facility operations we use cffo to assess our overall liquidity and to determine levels of executive compensation 
this measure provides an assessment of controllable expenses and affords us the ability to make decisions that facilitate meeting our current financial and liquidity goals as well as to achieve optimal financial performance 
it provides an indicator for us to determine if we need to make adjustments to our current spending decisions 
this metric measures our overall liquidity based on operational factors that we can influence in the short term  namely the cost structure or expenses of the organization 
cffo is one of the metrics used by us and our board of directors i to review our ability to service our outstanding indebtedness including our credit facilities and long term leases  ii to assess our ability to make regular recurring routine capital expenditures to maintain and improve our communities on a period to period basis  iii for planning purposes  including preparation of our annual budget  iv in setting various covenants in our credit agreements and v in determining levels of executive compensation 
limitations of cash from facility operations cffo has limitations as an analytical tool 
it should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for gaap measures of cash flows from operating activities 
cffo does not represent cash available for discretionary expenditures  since we may have mandatory debt service requirements or other non discretionary expenditures not reflected in the measure 
we believe cffo is useful to investors because it assists in their ability to meaningfully evaluate our ability to service our outstanding indebtedness  including our credit facilities and capital and financing leases  and our ability to make regular recurring routine capital expenditures to maintain and improve our communities 
cffo is not an alternative to cash flows provided by or used in operating activities as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
you should not rely on cffo as a substitute for any such gaap financial measure 
we strongly urge you to review the reconciliation of gaap net cash provided by operating activities to cffo  along with our consolidated financial statements included herein 
we also strongly urge you to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business 
in addition  because cffo is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and is susceptible to varying calculations  the cffo measure as presented in this report may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates due to our financing activities and changes in the availability of credit 
the table below provides information about our debt and capital lease and financing obligations  including weighted average interest rates on these obligations as of december  in thousands  except interest rates 
expected maturity year thereafter total fair value average interest rate long term debt capital lease obligations our results of operations are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of our short term and long term borrowings 
at december   we had approximately million of variable rate borrowings based on the monthly libor 
of this total variable rate debt  million varies with monthly libor with no libor floors or ceilings 
for every change in the monthly libor on this million in variable rate debt  interest expense will either increase or decrease by  as of december   the weighted average variable rate is in excess of monthly libor on million of the variable rate debt  and the monthly libor was 
in addition  we have variable rate debt of million that has libor floors at a weighted average floor of and a weighted average spread of  for a total weighted average rate of 
the libor floors effectively make this debt fixed rate debt as long as the monthly libor is less than the weighted average floor 
increases or decreases to the monthly libor do not change interest expense on this variable rate debt until the monthly libor rises above the floor and  conversely  interest expense does not decrease when the monthly libor falls below the floor 
this analysis does not consider changes in the actual level of borrowings or operating lease obligations that may occur subsequent to december  this analysis also does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment  nor does it consider actions that we might be able to take with respect to our financial structure to mitigate the exposure to such a change 
the downturn in the united states housing market in triggered a constriction in the availability of credit that continued through this could impact our ability to borrow money or refinance existing obligations at acceptable rates of interest 
thus far  we have experienced no significant barriers to obtaining credit
