results of operations the following table summarizes selected statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenues year ended december  revenues cost of services gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses impairment of goodwill operating income interest income interest expense income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss results of operations for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  revenues year ended december  change revenues by segment in thousands life sciences healthcare physician it and engineering total revenues increased million  or percent  as a result of improved operating environments in our it and engineering and life sciences segments and our acquisitions of cambridge and sharpstream  offset by continued weak demand for our services in our healthcare and physician segments 
consolidated revenues for the year ended december  include million related to our cambridge acquisition in the second quarter of and million related to the sharpstream acquisition in the third quarter of life sciences segment revenues increased million  or percent  primarily due to an percent increase in contract professionals on assignment and a million  or percent increase in direct hire and conversion fees 
the increase in revenues was primarily due to the increase in demand for life sciences service offerings as our clients end markets have improved with the economic recovery beginning in the second quarter of and the cambridge and sharpstream acquisitions 
healthcare segment revenues comprised of our nurse travel and allied healthcare lines of business decreased million  or percent 
nurse travel revenues decreased million  or percent  to million  which included million of revenue in generated from supporting customers that experienced labor disruptions 
the decrease was primarily due to a percent decrease in the average number of nurses on assignment and a percent decrease in the average bill rate 
allied healthcare revenues decreased million  or percent  to million due to an percent decrease in the average number of contract professionals on assignment and a million decrease in direct hire and conversion fee revenues 
these decreases were partially offset by a percent increase in the average bill rate 
based on our research and client feedback  we believe the decrease in revenues was attributable to continued adverse economic trends in the healthcare sector  which contributed to the decrease in number of travelers on assignment  open orders  and average bill rates 
while the allied healthcare operating environment continued to demonstrate signs of improvement  growth was constrained by i a continued reduction in demand for elective procedures  ii a greater number of patients choosing more cost effective forms of treatment such as self medication  iii hospitals reduced usage of contract professionals in response to declining cash balances and patient admissions and iv reduced demand for less critical allied skill modalities and a dramatic decline in demand for flu vaccine as compared to the hn pandemic we faced the prior year 
physician segment revenues decreased million  or percent 
the decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to a percent decrease in the average number of physicians on assignment 
these decreases were partially offset by a million  or percent increase in direct hire revenues 
the average bill rate for the physician segment was flat 
based on industry research and client feedback  we believe the decrease in revenues was primarily due to the economic conditions and high unemployment which have reduced the number of elective procedures and lowered patient census at client facilities 
it and engineering segment revenues increased million  or percent 
the increase in revenues was primarily due to a percent increase in the average number of contract professionals on assignment and a million increase in direct hire and conversion fee revenues 
these increases were partially offset by a percent decrease in the average bill rate 
because many of our placements involve capital projects  we believe that one of the reasons the demand for our it and engineering services has increased with the economic recovery is that more companies have increased their capital spending

our operating cash flows have been our primary source of liquidity and historically have been sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure needs 
our working capital requirements consist primarily of the financing of accounts receivable  payroll expenses and the periodic payments of principal and interest on our loans 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for compared with million for the period benefited from a significant reduction in accounts receivable of million versus an increase of million in these fluctuations in accounts receivable were primarily responsible for the significantly reduced operating cash flows in compared to this reduction was partially offset by increased cash flows resulting from an increase in accrued payroll and contract professional pay 
net cash used in investing activities was million during compared with million during cash paid for acquisitions was approximately million and capital expenditures for information technology projects  leasehold improvements and various property and equipment purchases increased million to million in we estimate that capital expenditures for will be approximately million 
net cash used in financing activities was million for  compared with million in during  principal payments of long term debt were million versus million paid down during on december   we replaced our existing credit facility with a new senior secured credit agreement  which consists of a million  five year term loan facility  a million  five year revolving loan facility and a million sublimit for letters of credit  as well as the ability to increase the loan facilities for up to an additional million  subject to receipt of lender commitments and satisfaction of specified conditions

proceeds from the new loan facility were million 
finally  the board of directors approved the repurchase of million worth of our common stock over a four year period  of which   shares were purchased in november at a total cost of million 
under terms of the new credit facility  the term loan facility is repayable at the minimum rate of million per quarter and we are required to reduce the term loan by up to percent of our excess cash flow based on leverage ratios  as defined by the agreement for each year end over the next five years 
we are required to maintain certain financial covenants  including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
as of december   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
additionally  the agreement  which is secured by substantially all of our assets  provides for certain limitations on our ability to  among other things  incur additional debt  offer loans  declare dividends and incur capital expenditures 
we continue to make progress on enhancements to our front office and back office information systems 
these enhancements include the consolidation of back office systems across all corporate functions  as well as enhancements to and broader application of our front office software across all lines of business 
the timing of the full integration of information systems used by vista and oxford will remain a consideration of management 
we believe that our working capital as of december   our new credit facility and positive operating cash flows expected from future activities will be sufficient to fund future requirements of our debt repayment obligations  accounts payable and related payroll expenses as well as capital expenditure initiatives for the next twelve months 
commitments and contingencies we lease space for our corporate and branch offices 
rent expense was million in  million in and million in the following table sets forth  on an aggregate basis  at december   the amounts of specified contractual cash obligations required to be paid in the periods shown in thousands contractual obligations thereafter total long term debt obligations operating lease obligations total for additional information about these contractual cash obligations  see note to our consolidated financial statements appearing in part ii  item of this report 
interest payments related to our bank debt are not set forth in the table above 
as of december   included in other current assets is a balance of million for claims indemnifiable by the selling shareholders of vista  which we anticipate will be settled by the agreement of all applicable parties to the terms and provisions related to such payment in we are partially self insured for our workers compensation liability related to the life sciences  healthcare and it and engineering segments as well as the medical malpractice liability related to the physician segment 
in connection with this program  we pay a base premium plus actual losses incurred up to certain levels and are insured for losses greater than certain levels per occurrence and in the aggregate 
the self insurance claim liability is determined based on claims filed and claims incurred but not yet reported 
we account for claims incurred but not yet reported based on estimates derived from historical claims experience and current trends of industry data 
changes in estimates  differences in estimates and actual payments for claims are recognized in the period that the estimates changed or payments were made 
the self insurance claim liability was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
additionally  we have unused stand by letters of credit outstanding to secure obligations for workers compensation claims with various insurance carriers 
the unused stand by letters of credit at december  and were million and million  respectively 
as of december  and  we have an income tax reserve in other long term liabilities related to our uncertain tax positions of million 
we are involved in various other legal proceedings  claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
however  based on the facts currently available  we do not believe that the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   the company had no significant off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases and unused stand by letters of credit outstanding 
accounting standards updates in january  the fasb issued an update to asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures asc  which requires new disclosures for fair value measurements and provides clarification for existing disclosure requirements 
more specifically  this update will require a an entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of levels and fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers  and b information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements to be presented separately ie present the activity on a gross basis rather than net in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level inputs 
this guidance clarifies existing disclosure requirements for the level of disaggregation used for classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value and requires disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements using level and level inputs 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosure are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   except for the disclosure requirements related to the purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the rollforward activity of level fair value measurements  which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements  which will be effective in the quarter ended march  in september  the fasb issued an update to asc topic  revenue recognition  which establishes the criteria for separating consideration in multiple element arrangements 
the updated guidance requires companies allocating the overall consideration to each deliverable to use an estimated selling price of individual deliverables in the arrangement in the absence of vendor specific evidence or other third party evidence of the selling price for the deliverables and it also provides additional factors that should be considered when determining whether software in a tangible product is essential to its functionality 
we adopted this guidance on january  with no impact to the consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued an update to asc on measuring liabilities at fair value 
the updated guidance provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted market price in an active market for an identical liability is not available  an entity is required to measure fair value using a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of an identical liability when traded as an asset or  if unavailable  quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar assets when traded as assets 
if none of this information is available  an entity should use a valuation technique in accordance with existing fair valuation principles 
we adopted the measurement requirements of this guidance in the quarter ended december  with no impact on the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii
