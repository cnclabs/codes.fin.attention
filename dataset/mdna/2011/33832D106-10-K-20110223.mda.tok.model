item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general industry trends the senior living industry generally is experiencing growth as a result of demographic factors 
according to census data  the population in the united states over age is growing much faster than the general population 
a large number of independent and assisted living communities were built in the s 
this development activity caused an excess supply of new  high priced communities 
longer than projected fill up periods resulted in low occupancy  price discounting and financial distress for many independent and assisted living operators 
development activity was significantly reduced in the early part of the last decade 
we believe that the nationwide supply and demand for these types of facilities is about balanced today 
we believe that the aging of the united states population and the almost complete reliance of independent and assisted living services upon revenues from residents private resources should mean that these types of facilities can be profitably operated 
the increasing availability of assisted living facilities in the s caused occupancy at many snfs to decline 
this fact  together with restrictions on development of new snfs by most states  has generally caused nursing care to be delivered in older facilities 
we believe that many snfs currently in operation are becoming physically obsolete and that political pressures from an aging population will eventually cause governmental authorities to permit increased new construction 
beginning in  problems in certain domestic credit markets presaged a global credit crisis that led to recession in the united states 
the recession resulted in aggressive government spending in the 
table of contents united states  significant corporate layoffs  reduced availability of credit on reasonable terms in most markets  and lower real estate prices 
this economic weakness has dampened demand for some types of senior living communities in certain markets and our occupancy rates have modestly declined 
also  we have experienced some pricing pressures from competition 
at the same time  we believe our business to be inherently healthy and that the recent decline in senior housing construction soon may have an offsetting effect to any decline in demand 
rehabilitation hospitals provide intensive medical services  including physical therapy  occupational therapy and speech language services beyond the capability customarily available in snfs 
we believe that our experience in providing high quality rehabilitation services at our irfs has assisted us to provide increasing amounts of rehabilitation services at our senior living communities 
institutional pharmacies provide large quantities of drugs at locations where patients with recurring pharmacy requirements are concentrated 
the business rationale for an institutional pharmacy is to deliver drugs and pharmacy services more efficiently and at lower costs than from expensive retail locations which cater to short term requirements 
the aging of the population and recent pharmacological innovations have created rapidly growing demand for pharmacy drugs and services 
the medicare part d prescription drug benefit was implemented in pursuant to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of  or mma  and by december  approximately of medicare beneficiaries had prescription drug coverage  mostly through medicare part d  according to hhs 
because the mma has increased medicare expenditures for prescription drugs  the federal government has sought to implement various cost control measures and as a result  the profitability of providing pharmacy goods and services has been reduced 
we anticipate that this trend will continue 
because the profits available from individual pharmacy transactions have been  and likely will continue to be reduced  we believe our institutional pharmacy business will need to expand to maintain or improve its financial results 
operations we earn our senior living revenue primarily by providing housing and services to our senior living residents 
during  approximately of our senior living revenues came from the medicare and medicaid programs and approximately of our senior living revenues came from residents private resources 
we bill all private pay residents in advance for the housing and services to be provided in the following month 
our material expenses are wages and benefits includes wages for our employees working at our senior living communities and wage related expenses such as health insurance  workers compensation insurance and other benefits 
other operating expenses includes utilities  housekeeping  dietary  maintenance  marketing  insurance and community level administrative costs at our senior living communities 
rent expense we lease senior living communities excluding four senior living communities classified as discontinued operations and two rehabilitation hospitals from snh and four senior living communities from hcpi 
hospital expenses includes wages and benefits for our hospital based staff and other operating expenses related to our hospital business 
institutional pharmacy expenses includes the cost of drugs dispensed to our patients as well as wages and benefits for our pharmacies staff and other operating expenses related to our pharmacy business 

table of contents general and administrative expenses principally wage related costs for headquarters and regional staff supporting our communities  hospitals and pharmacies 
depreciation and amortization expense we incur depreciation expense on buildings and furniture and equipment that we own  and we incur amortization expense on certain identifiable intangible assets related to our pharmacy acquisitions 
interest and other expenses primarily includes interest on outstanding debt and amortization of deferred financing costs 
our reportable segments consist of our senior living community business and our rehabilitation hospital business 
in the senior living community segment  we operate independent living communities  assisted living communities and snfs 
our rehabilitation hospital segment provides inpatient health rehabilitation services at two hospital locations and three satellite locations and outpatient rehabilitation services at outpatient clinics 
we do not consider our institutional pharmacy operations to be a material  separately reportable segment of our business 
consequently  we report our institutional pharmacy revenues and expense as separate items within our corporate and other activities 
all of our operations and assets are located in the united states  except for the operations of our captive insurance company  which participates in our workers compensation and liability insurance programs and is located in the cayman islands 
see our consolidated financial statements included in exhibits and financial statement schedules of this annual report on form k for further financial information on our operating segments 
we use segment operating profit as an important measure to evaluate our performance and for business decision making purposes 
segment operating profit excludes interest and other income  interest and other expense and corporate expenses

table of contents auction rate securities until june   our investments in trading securities consisted of ars which are primarily bonds issued by various entities to fund student loans pursuant to the federal family education loan program 
due to events in the credit markets  auctions for these ars failed starting in the first quarter of in november  we entered into a settlement agreement with ubs ag  or ubs  related to our investment in ars and on june   we exercised our right  or the ubs put right  pursuant to this agreement to require ubs to acquire our remaining ars at par value 
upon exercise of the ubs put right  we removed the fair value of our ars and ubs put right from our balance sheet and recorded a receivable from ubs 
ubs settled and paid to us million on july   which was net of our outstanding balance on our ubs secured revolving credit facility of million 
prior to exercising the ubs put right  we measured the fair value of our ars by reference to a valuation statement provided by ubs that was calculated with the assistance of a valuation model 
this model considered  among other items  the collateral underlying the investments  the creditworthiness of the counterparty  the timing of expected future cash flows including possible refinancing of the securities and a determination of the appropriate discount rate 
the analysis also included a comparison  when possible  to observable market data of securities with characteristics similar to our ars 
we reviewed the components of  and calculations made under  ubs model 
prior to exercising the ubs put right  we valued the ubs put right by taking into consideration the fair value of our ars  the amounts outstanding on our loan with ubs and a factor representing our credit party risk with ubs 
the largest risk associated with the ubs put right was the continued financial solvency of ubs 
the value of the ubs put right typically fluctuated inversely with the value of the ars that we held 
we recorded the ubs put right at fair value since we expected that the changes in fair value of the ubs put right would be largely offset by the changes in the fair value in the ars 
assets and liabilities our total current assets at december  were million  compared to million at december  at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  our current liabilities were million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease in current assets was primarily the result of our repayment of our outstanding balance on our ubs revolving credit facility and the acquisition of one senior living community

during  we prepaid hud insured mortgage debt of million 
during we issued million common shares to snh for an allocated value of million as part of the lease realignment agreement 
acquisitions including the initiation of long term leases and related financings in  we leased from snh senior living communities with a total of  living units 
twenty seven of these communities are assisted living communities one of which offers some skilled nursing services and one of which offers some independent living services  eight are independent living 
table of contents communities and two are continuing care retirement communities which offer independent living  assisted living and skilled nursing services 
our rent payable to snh for these communities is million per year  plus future increases calculated as a percentage of the revenue increases for of these communities after in connection with one of the leases we initiated in  we also acquired from the prior owner of the communities its ownership interest in certain operating companies  working capital  certain long term liabilities  and operating practices and processes  especially in the memory care area 
we accounted for this transaction as a business combination and  after allocating the purchase price to applicable assets and liabilities based on their fair value  we recorded as goodwill the  excess consideration over fair value of identifiable assets 
included in the senior living communities described above are seven assisted living communities with units located in pennsylvania and new jersey that were previously operated by newseasons assisted living communities  inc  or newseasons  under a lease from snh 
we leased these communities in july for annual rent of approximately million per year 
in consideration of our lease assumption  newseasons paid us million and transferred title to certain personal property located at the communities 
we recorded the newseasons consideration as a deferred credit on our balance sheet  which we are amortizing as a reduction of rent expense over the remaining lease term 
simultaneously with leasing these seven communities from snh  we purchased three additional newseasons communities from snh with units located in pennsylvania and new jersey for million 
we allocated the purchase price of these communities to land  building and equipment 
the ten newseasons communities complement our business strategy of focusing our operations in high quality senior living assets where residents pay for our services with private resources 
the majority of the revenues from these communities come from residents private resources 
in december  we also acquired seven independent and assisted living communities  with a total of living units  located in north carolina and south carolina for a purchase price of million excluding closing costs 
we financed the acquisition with cash on hand and drawings under our former credit facility with ubs 
in  we leased from snh senior living communities with a total of living units 
ten of these communities are assisted living communities and were added to lease no 
 which has a current term expiring in one of these communities is a continuing care retirement community which offers independent  assisted living and skilled nursing services and was added to lease no

our rent payable to snh for these communities is million per year  plus future increases calculated as a percentage of the revenue increases of these communities after in august  we acquired from an unrelated party a continuing care retirement community containing living units located in wisconsin for million 
we financed the acquisition with cash on hand and by the assumption of million of resident deposits 
our leases with snh as of december   we leased senior living communities  two rehabilitation hospitals and four senior living communities which have been classified as discontinued operations from snh under four leases 
our total annual rent payable to snh as of december  was million  
table of contents excluding percentage rent based on increases in gross revenues at certain properties 
we paid approximately million and million in percentage rent to snh for the years ended december  and  respectively 
upon our request  snh may purchase capital improvements made at the properties we lease from snh and increase our rent pursuant to contractual formulas 
during the year ended december   snh reimbursed us million for capital expenditures made at the properties leased from snh and these purchases resulted in our annual rent being increased by approximately million 
our revenues our revenues from services to residents at our senior living communities and patients of our rehabilitation hospitals and clinics and our pharmacies are our primary source of cash to fund our operating expenses  including rent  principal and interest payments on our debt and our capital expenditures 
during the past three years  weak economic conditions throughout the country have negatively affected our occupancy 
these conditions have impacted many companies both within and outside of our industry and it is unclear when current economic conditions  especially the housing market  may materially improve 
although many of the services we provide are needs driven  some of those needs may be deferred during recessions  for example  relocating to a senior living community may be delayed when sales of houses are delayed 
at some of our senior living communities principally our snfs and at our rehabilitation hospitals and clinics  medicare and medicaid programs provide operating revenues for skilled nursing and rehabilitation services 
medicare and medicaid revenues were earned primarily at our snfs and our two rehabilitation hospitals 
we derived  and of our revenues from these programs for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our net medicare revenues from services to senior living community residents and at our rehabilitation hospitals totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our net medicaid revenues from services to senior living community residents and at our rehabilitation hospitals totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cms has recently adopted rules that took effect on october  that it estimates will increase aggregate medicare payment rates for snfs by approximately and increase aggregate medicare payment rates for irfs by approximately in federal fiscal year actions of congress or cms may change these estimates 
some of the states in which we operate either have not raised medicaid rates by amounts sufficient to offset increasing costs or have frozen or reduced  or are expected to freeze or reduce  medicaid rates 
also  congress extended certain increases in federal payments to states for medicaid programs  in effect since october   that were scheduled to expire on december   for an additional six months through june   but at substantially reduced levels 
we expect the phasing out of these temporary federal payments  combined with the anticipated slow recovery of state revenues  to result in continued difficult state fiscal conditions 
some state budget deficits likely will increase  and certain states may reduce medicaid payments to healthcare services providers like us as part of an effort to balance their budgets 
we cannot currently estimate the type and magnitude of the potential medicare and medicaid policy changes  rate reductions or other changes and the impact on us of the possible failure of these programs to increase rates to match our increasing expenses  but they may be material to our operations and may affect our future results of operations 
similarly  we are unable to predict the impact on us of the insurance reforms  payment reforms  and health care delivery systems reforms contained in and to be developed pursuant to ppaca 
expanded insurance availability may provide more paying customers for the services we provide 
however  if the changes to be implemented under ppaca result in reduced payments for our services  or the failure of medicare  
table of contents medicaid or insurance payment rates to cover our increasing costs  our future financial results could be adversely and materially affected 
medicare and medicaid programs provided approximately  and of our revenues from our rehabilitation hospitals for each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
for payments on and after april   the schip extension act reset the medicare rate increase at our irfs to zero percent for federal fiscal years and also  on july   cms issued a rule updating the medicare irf prospective rate formulas for the federal fiscal year the rule revises the weights assigned to patient case mix groups that are used to calculate rates under the irf pps  and resets the outlier threshold to maintain estimated outlier payments at of total estimated irf payments for the year 
cms adopted an increase of approximately to medicare prospective payment rates at irfs for the fiscal year effective october   to account for inflation and set the outlier limits at of total estimated irf payments 
cms also adopted regulations clarifying the coverage criteria for medicare payments in irfs  to be effective january  cms has recently adopted an increase of approximately to medicare prospective payment rates at irfs for the federal fiscal year  including to account for inflation  reduced by in accordance with ppaca and a decrease of in irf outlier payments 
cms has issued the rule establishing revised medicare criteria that rehabilitation hospitals must meet in order to participate as irfs in the medicare program 
as amended  the rule requires that for cost reporting periods starting on and after july   of a facility inpatient population must require intensive rehabilitation services for one of the cms designated medical conditions 
an irf that fails to meet the requirements of this rule is subject to reclassification as a different type of healthcare provider  and the effect of such reclassification would be to lower medicare payment rates 
as of december  and february   we believe our rehabilitation hospitals are operating in compliance with the cms requirements to remain irfs 
however  the actual percentage of patients at our irfs who meet these medicare requirements may not be or remain as high as we believe or anticipate or may decline 
our failure to remain in compliance  or a cms finding of noncompliance  if it occurs  will result in our receiving lower medicare rates than we currently receive at our irfs 
insurance increases over time in the costs of insurance  especially tort liability insurance  workers compensation and employee health insurance  have had an adverse impact upon our results of operations 
although we self insure a large portion of these costs  our costs have increased as a result of the higher costs that we incur to settle claims and to purchase re insurance for claims in excess of the self insurance amounts 
these increased costs may continue in the future 
for more information about our existing insurance see business insurance of this annual report on form k 
to obtain control over our insurance costs  and as described herein  we and other companies to which rmr provides management services have formed an insurance company which has begun to underwrite certain of our insurance requirements

critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies concern revenue recognition  our assessments of the net realizable value of our accounts receivable  reserves related to our self insurance programs  income tax valuation allowances and our valuations of our goodwill  other intangibles and long lived assets 
our revenue recognition policies involve judgments about medicare and medicaid rate calculations 
these judgments are based principally upon our experience with these programs and our knowledge of current rules and regulations applicable to these programs 
we recognize revenues when services are provided and these amounts are reported at their estimated net realizable amounts 
some medicare and medicaid revenues are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment and sometimes retroactive legislative changes 
our policies for valuing accounts receivable based upon our experience  involve significant judgments based upon our experience  including consideration of the age of the receivables  the terms of the agreements with our residents  their third party payers or other obligors  the residents or payers stated intent to pay  the residents or payers financial capacity and other factors which may include litigation or rate and payment appeal proceedings 
determining reserves for the casualty  liability  workers compensation and healthcare losses and costs that we have incurred as of the end of a reporting period involves significant judgments based upon our experience and our expectations of future events  including projected settlements for pending claims  known incidents which we expect may result in claims  estimates of incurred but not yet reported claims  expected changes in premiums for insurance provided by insurers whose policies provide for retroactive adjustments  estimated litigation costs and other factors 
since these reserves are based on estimates  the actual expenses we incur may differ from the amount reserved 
we regularly adjust these estimates to reflect changes in the foregoing factors  our actual claims experience  recommendations from our professional consultants  changes in market conditions and other factors  it is possible that such adjustments may be material 
we do not currently recognize the benefit of all of our deferred tax assets  including tax loss carry forwards  that may be used to offset future taxable income because we currently do not believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize such benefit 
in measuring our deferred tax assets  we considered all available evidence  both positive and negative  to determine whether  based on weight of that evidence  a valuation allowance is needed for all or a portion of the deferred tax assets 
judgment is required in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
the more negative evidence that exists  the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is unnecessary 
in order to assess the likelihood of realizing the benefit of these deferred tax assets  we are required to rely on our projections of future income 
we believe that our history of losses coupled with the uncertainties surrounding the current changes to the healthcare industry and our declining occupancy rates creates sufficient negative evidence such that we are unable to conclude that realization of the benefit is more 
table of contents likely than not 
we have a short history of operating profits that is largely limited to while we reported earnings before taxes for the years ended december  and  we reported an operating loss in and approximately million of the million of operating profits from continuing operations that we reported in were the results of gains on early extinguishment of debt 
our occupancy rates remain at historic lows and our recent trends indicating improvement have fluctuated 
in addition  slight changes to certain key operating metrics in our baseline forecast suggest that we could generate tax losses  for example  occupancy decreasing by coupled with a reduction in government or third party reimbursement rates 
as a result  we have concluded that it is appropriate to maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets until our profitability becomes more predictable 
we may reverse some or all of the valuation allowance when we believe that we will more likely than not realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets 
at that time  we will record deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations  which will affect our results of operations 
we review goodwill annually during our fourth quarter  or more frequently  if events or changes in circumstances exist  for impairment 
if our review indicates that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value  we reduce the carrying amount to fair value 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  which we determined to be the segments we operate  by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit as determined by its discounted cash flows and market approaches  such as capitalization rates and earnings multiples  with its carrying value 
the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis include future revenue growth  gross margins and our weighted average cost of capital 
we select a growth rate based on our view of the growth prospect of each of our segments 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with its carrying amount to measure the amount of impairment loss 
our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in operating performance 
during our annual goodwill impairment review  we determined no impairments should be recorded 
we review the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if there is an indication that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable  we determine the amount of impairment loss  if any  by comparing the historical carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value 
we determine estimated fair value through an evaluation of recent financial performance  recent sales of similar assets  market conditions and projected undiscounted cash flows that our asset or asset groups are expected to generate 
this process requires that estimates be made and errors in our judgments or estimates could have a material effect on our financial statements 
during we determined that no impairment charges were required 
some of our judgments and estimates are based upon published industry statistics and in some cases third party professionals 
any errors in our estimates or judgments affecting our critical accounting policy could have a material effect on our financial statements 
in the future we may need to revise the judgments  estimates and assessments we use to formulate our critical accounting policies to incorporate information which is not now known 
we cannot predict the effect changes to the premises underlying our critical accounting policies may have on our future results of operations  although such changes could be material and adverse 
recently announced accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board issued an accounting standards update requiring additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
the update requires reporting entities to disclose additional information regarding assets and liabilities that are transferred between 
table of contents levels within the fair value hierarchy 
the update also clarifies the level of disaggregation at which fair value disclosures should be made and the requirements to disclose information about the valuation techniques and inputs used in estimating level and level fair values 
the update is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  except for the requirement to separately disclose purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross basis in the level roll forward that becomes effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  the adoption of this update did not  and is not expected to  cause any material changes to the disclosures in our consolidated financial statements 
inflation and deflation inflation in the past several years in the united states has been modest 
future inflation might have either positive or negative impacts on our business 
rising price levels may allow us to increase occupancy charges to residents  but may also cause our operating costs  including our percentage rent  to increase 
also  our ability to realize rate increases paid by medicare and medicaid programs may be limited despite inflation 
deflation would likely have a negative impact upon us 
a large component of our expenses consists of our fixed minimum rental obligations to snh and hcpi 
accordingly we believe that a general decline in price levels which could cause our charges to residents to decline would likely not be fully offset by a decline in our expenses 
seasonality our senior living business is subject to modest effects of seasonality 
during the calendar fourth quarter holiday periods  nursing home and assisted living residents are sometimes discharged to join family celebrations and relocations and admission decisions are often deferred 
the first quarter of each calendar year usually coincides with increased illness among nursing home and assisted living residents which can result in increased costs or discharges to hospitals 
as a result of these factors  nursing home and assisted living operations sometimes produce greater earnings in the second and third quarters of a calendar year and lesser earnings in the first and fourth quarters 
we do not believe that this seasonality will cause fluctuations in our revenues or operating cash flow to such an extent that we will have difficulty paying our expenses  including rent  which do not fluctuate seasonally 
impact of climate change the current political debates about world climate changes has resulted in various existing and proposed treaties  laws and regulations which are intended to limit carbon emissions 
we believe treaties  laws and regulations which may limit carbon emissions may cause energy costs at our communities to increase 
in the longer term  we believe any such increased costs will be passed through and paid by our patients  residents and other customers in higher charges for our services 
however  in the short term  these increased costs  if material in amount  could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates 
we manage our exposure to this market risk by monitoring available financing alternatives 
our strategy to manage exposure to changes in interest rates is unchanged from december  other than as described below  we do not foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this exposure in the near future 
changes in market interest rates also affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt  increases in market interest rates decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt  while decreases in market interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
for example  based upon discounted cash flow analysis  if prevailing interest rates were to increase by of current interest rates  and other credit market conditions remained unchanged  the aggregate market value of our million fixed rate mortgage debt and million outstanding notes on december  would decline by approximately million  and  similarly  if prevailing interest rates were to decline by of current interest rates  and other credit market conditions remained unchanged  the aggregate market value of our million fixed rate mortgage debt and million outstanding notes on december   would increase by approximately million 
our credit agreement bears interest at floating rates and matures on march  as of december  and february   no amounts were outstanding under this credit facility 
we borrow in us dollars and borrowings under our revolving credit facility require annual interest at libor with a floor of per annum plus basis points 
accordingly  we are vulnerable to changes in us dollar based short term interest rates  specifically libor 
a change in interest rates would not affect the value of any outstanding floating rate debt but could affect our operating results 
for example  if the maximum amount of million were drawn under our credit agreement and interest rates above the floor or minimum rate decreased or increased by per annum  our annual interest expense would decrease or increase by  per year  or per share  based on our outstanding common shares 
if interest rates were to change gradually over time  the impact would occur over time 
our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates may increase in the future if we incur additional debt to fund acquisitions or otherwise
