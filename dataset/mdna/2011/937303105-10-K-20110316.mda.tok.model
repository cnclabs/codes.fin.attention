growth strategy the company s strategy is one of value added growth 
management believes that qualitative and sustainable growth of the company  coupled with maintaining profitability  is currently the most appropriate path to providing good value for its shareholders 
prior to  the company s growth had been primarily achieved organically 
the company attributes its reputation for focusing on customer service and satisfaction as one of the cornerstones to the company s success 
the company s primary objectives are to improve profitability and operating efficiencies  increase market penetration in areas currently served and to continue an expansion strategy in appropriate market areas 
the company s geographical expansion to date has primarily been concentrated along the i corridor from snohomish to whatcom counties  however  additional areas will be considered if they meet the company s criteria 
acquisition of banks or branches may also be used as a means of expansion if appropriate opportunities are presented 
the primary factors considered in determining the areas of geographic expansion are the availability of knowledgeable personnel  such as managers and lending officers with experience in their fields of expertise  longstanding community presence and extensive banking relationships  customer demand and perceived market potential 
on april  and september   the bank acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of city bank and north county bank  respectively  from the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic in fdic assisted transactions 
management believes that increasing the success of current branches and expanding into appropriate market places while managing up front costs is an excellent way to build franchise value and increase business 
the company s strategy is to support its employees in providing a high level of personal service to its customers while expanding the loan  deposit and investment products and other services that the company offers 
maintenance of asset quality will be emphasized by controlling nonperforming assets and adhering to prudent underwriting standards 
in addition  management will maintain its focus on improving operating efficiencies and internal operating systems to further manage noninterest expense 
growth requires expenditures of substantial sums to purchase or lease real property and equipment and to hire experienced personnel 
new branch offices are often not profitable for a period of time after opening and management expects that earnings may be negatively affected in the short term 
market areas the company s primary market area currently consists of island  king  san juan  skagit  snohomish and whatcom counties in northwest washington state 
although the pacific northwest is typically associated with industries such as computer technology  aerospace and coffee  the company s market encompasses distinct economies that are somewhat removed from the seattle metropolitan region 
island county s largest population center  oak harbor  is dominated by a large military presence with naval operations at nas whidbey island 
the jobs generated by nas whidbey contribute significantly to the county s economy 
other primary industries providing employment for county residents are education  health and social services  retail trade  and  manufacturing 
due to its natural beauty  the county attracts tourism and has a number of retirement communities 

table of contents king county is the most populous county in washington and is the largest business center in both the state of washington and pacific northwest 
the county is home to some of the world s most successful businesses including amazon  boeing  costco and starbucks 
king county is a leading global center for several emerging industries  including aerospace  biotechnology  clean technology  information technology and international trade and logistics 
the economy of san juan county is predominantly comprised of retail trade  tourism  finance and insurance and real estate services

whatcom county  which borders canada  has an economy with a prominent manufacturing base  as well as a significant academic research and vocational technical base  as it is the home of western washington university  one of washington s largest four year academic centers 
the united states customs and border patrol and municipal  county and state governments give whatcom county an additional employment base 
the company operates in a highly competitive banking environment  competing for deposits  loans and other financial services with a number of larger and well established commercial banks  savings banks  savings and loan associations  credit unions and other institutions  including nonbanking financial services companies 
some of the bank s competitors are not subject to the same regulations as the bank and may have lower operating costs 
larger institutions have substantially higher lending limits  and may offer certain services that the bank does not provide 
federal law allows mergers or other combinations  relocations of a bank s main office and branching across state lines 
recent amendments to the federal banking laws to eliminate certain barriers between banking and commercial firms are expected to result in even greater competition in the future 
although the company has been able to compete effectively in its market areas to date  there can be no assurance that the company s competitive efforts will continue to be successful

the bank is a washington state chartered commercial bank and is subject to examination  supervision and regulation by the washington state department of financial institutions division of banks division 
the fdic insures the bank s deposits and in that capacity also regulates the bank 
the following discussion provides an overview of the extensive regulatory framework applicable to the company and the bank 
laws and regulations governing the company and the bank are primarily designed to protect depositors  consumers  the deposit insurance fund and the banking system  rather than shareholders 
to the extent that this section describes statutory and regulatory provisions  it is qualified by reference to those provisions 
the company s earnings and activities are affected by legislation  by actions of the frb  the division  the fdic and other regulators  by local legislative and administrative bodies  and by decisions of federal and washington state courts 
these include limitations on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the company  and numerous federal and state consumer protection laws imposing requirements on the making  enforcement  and collection of consumer loans  and restrictions by regulators on the sale of mutual funds and other uninsured investment products to customers 
additional legislation may be enacted or regulations imposed to further regulate banking and financial services or to limit finance charges or other fees or charges earned in such activities 
we anticipate significant additional regulation and increased compliance costs in the current environment 
bank holding company regulation as a bank holding company  the company is subject to regulation  supervision and examination by the federal reserve 
in general  the bhc act limits the business of bank holding companies to owning or controlling banks and engaging in other activities closely related to banking 
the company must file reports with and provide the federal reserve such additional information as it may require 

table of contents congress enacted major federal financial institution reform legislation in  allowing bank holding companies to elect to become financial holding companies 
in addition to activities previously permitted bank holding companies  financial holding companies may engage in nonbanking activities that are financial in nature  such as securities  insurance and merchant banking activities  subject to certain limitations 
the activities of bank holding companies  such as the company that are not financial holding companies  are generally limited to managing or controlling banks

nonbank acquisitions by bank holding companies such as the company are generally limited to of voting shares of a company and activities previously determined by the frb by regulation or order to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to banking or managing or controlling banks 
the gramm leach bliley act glb act included the most extensive consumer privacy provisions ever enacted by congress 
these provisions  among other things  require full disclosure of the company s privacy policy to consumers and mandate offering the consumer the ability to opt out of having non public personal information disclosed to third parties 
pursuant to these provisions  the federal banking regulators have adopted privacy regulations 
in addition  the states are permitted to adopt more extensive privacy protections through legislation or regulation 
the company does not disclose any nonpublic personal information about its customers or former customers to anyone  except as permitted by law 
transactions with affiliates there are various legal restrictions on transactions between the company and any nonbank subsidiaries  and between the company and the bank 
with certain exceptions  federal law also imposes limitations on  and requires collateral for  extensions of credit by insured depository institutions  such as the bank  to their nonbank affiliates  such as the company 
these regulations limit the company s ability to obtain funds from the bank for its liquidity needs 
tying arrangements 
we are prohibited from engaging in certain tie in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit  sale or lease of property or furnishing of services 
for example  with certain exceptions  neither the company nor its subsidiaries may condition an extension of credit to a customer on either i a requirement that the customer obtain additional services provided by us  or ii an agreement by the customer to refrain from obtaining other services from a competitor 
support of the bank 
under federal reserve policy  the company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to the bank 
the company is required to commit  as necessary  resources to support the operations of the bank 
any capital loans a bank holding company makes to its subsidiary banks are subordinate to deposits and other indebtedness of those subsidiary banks 
state law restrictions 
as a washington corporation  the company is subject to certain limitations and restrictions under washington corporate law  including those related to indemnification of directors  distributions to shareholders  transactions involving directors  officers or interested shareholders  maintenance of books  records  and minutes  and observance of corporate formalities 
interstate banking and branching 
the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of interstate act permits nationwide interstate banking and branching under certain circumstances 
subject to certain limitations and restrictions  a bank holding company  with prior approval of the frb  may acquire an out of state bank 
banks in states that do not prohibit out of state mergers may merge with the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency 
the dodd frank act removed interstate act restrictions on de novo branching across state lines and banks can now open a new branch or purchase a branch in another state to the same extent that a bank chartered in such state may do 

table of contents federal and state bank regulation 
among other things  applicable federal and state statutes and regulations which govern a bank s activities relate to minimum capital requirements  required reserves against deposits  investments  loans  legal lending limits  mergers and consolidations  borrowings  issuance of securities  payment of dividends  establishment of branches and other aspects of its operations 
the division and the fdic also have authority to prohibit banks under their supervision from engaging in what they consider to be unsafe and unsound practices 
the bank is required to file periodic reports with the fdic and the division and is subject to periodic examinations and evaluations by those regulatory authorities 
these examinations must be conducted every months 
the fdic and the division may each accept the results of an examination by the other in lieu of conducting an independent examination 
in the liquidation or other resolution of a failed insured depository institution  deposits in offices and certain claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation are afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims  including nondeposit claims  and claims of a parent company such as the company 
such priority creditors would include the fdic  which succeeds to the position of insured depositors 
insider credit transactions 
banks are subject to restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers  directors  principal shareholders or any related interests of such persons 
insider transactions must be made on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  and follow credit underwriting procedures that are at least as stringent as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not covered above and who are not employees 
in addition  such transactions must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 
banks are also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to insiders 
a violation of these restrictions may result in the assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties  the imposition of a cease and desist order  and other regulatory sanctions 
management 
federal law sets forth circumstances under which officers or directors of a bank may be removed by the institution s federal supervisory agency and prohibits management personnel of a bank from serving as a director or in other management positions of another financial institution whose assets exceed a specified amount or which has an office within a specified geographic area 
additional safety and soundness standards 
federal law imposes certain non capital safety and soundness standards upon banks 
these standards cover internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  compensation  fees and benefits  such other operational and managerial standards as the agency determines to be appropriate  and standards for asset quality  earnings and stock valuation 
an institution that fails to meet these standards must develop a plan acceptable to its regulators  specifying the steps that the institution will take to meet the standards 
failure to submit or implement such a plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions 
federal deposit insurance 
substantially all deposits with the bank are insured up to applicable limits by the deposit insurance fund dif of the fdic and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the dif 
the fdic uses a risk based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a bank s capital level and supervisory ratings 
the base assessment rates under the federal deposit insurance reform act of reform act  enacted in february  ranged from to per of deposits annually 
the fdic could increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule five basis points annualized higher or lower than the base rates in order to manage the dif to prescribed statutory target levels 
for  the effective assessment amounts were above the base rate amounts 
assessment rates for well managed  well capitalized institutions ranged from to per of deposits annually 
the bank s assessment rate for fell within this range 
in  the fdic issued one time assessment credits that could be used to offset this expense 
the bank s credit was fully utilized in and covered the majority of that year s assessment 
the bank did not have any remaining credit to offset assessments in 
table of contents in december  the fdic adopted a rule that amended the system for risk based assessments and changed assessment rates in attempt to restore targeted reserve ratios in the dif 
effective january   the risk based assessment rates were uniformly raised by seven basis points annualized 
on february   the fdic adopted further modified the risk based assessment system  effective april   to effectively require larger risk institutions to pay a larger share of the assessment 
characteristics of larger risk institutions include a significant reliance on secured liabilities or brokered deposits  particularly when combined with rapid asset growth 
the rule also provided incentives for institutions to hold long term unsecured debt and  for smaller institutions  high levels of tier capital 
the initial base assessment rates range from to per of deposits annually 
after potential adjustments related to unsecured debt  secured liabilities and brokered deposit balances  the final total assessment rates range from to per of deposits annually 
initial base assessment rates for well managed  well capitalized institutions ranged from to per of deposits annually 
the bank s assessment rate for fell within this range 
further increases in the assessment rate could have a material adverse effect on our earnings  depending upon the amount of the increase 
in october  the fdic adopted a new dif restoration plan to ensure that the fund reserve ratio reaches by september   as required by the dodd frank act 
under the new restoration plan  the fdic will forego the uniform three basis point increase in initial assessment rates schedules for january   and maintain the current schedule of assessment rates 
at least semi annually  the fdic will update its loss and income projections for the dif and  if needed  increase or decrease assessment rates 
the fdic has proposed additional rules to change the deposit insurance assessment system 
in  the reform act increased the deposit insurance limit for certain retirement plan deposit accounts from  to  the basic insurance limit for other deposits  including individuals  joint account holders  businesses  government entities  and trusts  remained at  the reform act also provided for the merger of the two deposit insurance funds administered by the fdic  the bank insurance fund bif and the savings association insurance fund saif  into the dif 
on october   the eesa temporarily raised the basic limit on federal deposit insurance coverage from  to  per depositor 
the basic deposit insurance limit would have returned to  after december  on may   the helping families save their homes act extended the temporary increase in the standard maximum deposit insurance amount to  per depositor through december  the standard maximum deposit insurance amount would return to  on january  the dodd frank act permanently raises the current standard maximum federal deposit insurance amount from  to  per qualified account 
in november  the fdic approved the final ruling establishing the transaction account guarantee program tagp as part of the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp 
under this program  effective immediately and through december   all non interest bearing transaction accounts became fully guaranteed by the fdic for the entire amount in the account 
this unlimited coverage also extended to now interest bearing deposit accounts earning an interest rate no greater than and all ioltas lawyers trust accounts 
coverage under the tagp  funded through insurance premiums paid by participating financial institutions  was in addition to and separate from the additional coverage announced under eesa 
in august  the fdic extended the tagp portion of the tlgp through june  in june  the fdic extended the tagp portion of the tlgp for an additional six months  from july  to december  the rule required that interest rates on qualifying now accounts offered by banks participating in the program be reduced to from 
the rule provided for an additional extension of the program  without further rulemaking  for a period of time not to exceed december  the bank elected to participate in the tagp program through the extended period 
in july  the dodd frank act  was enacted which provides for unlimited deposit insurance for noninterest bearing transactions accounts excluding now  but including ioltas beginning december  for a period of two years 
the fdic may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if it determines that the institution has engaged in or is engaging in unsafe and unsound banking practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition or has violated any applicable law  regulation or order or any condition imposed in writing by  or 
table of contents pursuant to  any written agreement with the fdic 
the termination of deposit insurance for the bank could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations due to the fact that the bank s liquidity position would likely be affected by deposit withdrawal activity 
community reinvestment act 
the community reinvestment act cra requires that  in connection with examinations of financial institutions within their jurisdiction  regulators must evaluate the records of the financial institutions in meeting the credit needs of their local communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods  consistent with the safe and sound operation of those banks 
these factors are also considered in evaluating mergers  acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility 
capital adequacy 
the company and the bank are subject to risk based capital and leverage guidelines issued by federal banking agencies for banks and bank holding companies 
these agencies are required by law to take specific prompt corrective actions with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital standards 
as of december   the company and the bank exceeded the minimum capital standards 
broad regulatory authority is given to the fdic if capital levels drop below minimum standards including restrictions on growth  acquisition  branching and new lines of business as well as interest rate restrictions on deposit gathering activities 
dividends 
the bank is subject to restrictions on the payment of cash dividends to the company 
the principal source of the company s cash flow is dividends received from the bank  the issuance of junior subordinated debentures  and cash received from the exercise of stock options 
regulatory authorities may prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying dividends which would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
in addition  a bank may not pay cash dividends if that payment could reduce the amount of its capital below that necessary to meet the adequately capitalized level in accordance with regulatory capital requirements 
also  the payment of cash dividends by the bank must satisfy a net profits test and an undivided profits test or the bank must obtain prior approval of its regulators before such dividend is paid 
the net profits test limits the dividend declared in any calendar year to the net profits of the current year plus retained net income of the preceding two years 
the undivided profits test limits the dividends declared to the undivided profits on hand after deducting bad debts in excess of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
washington law also provides that no cash dividend may be paid if  after giving effect to the dividend  a corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business  or a corporation s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities 
the company is limited in its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders 
frb policy states that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization s expected future needs and financial condition 
the policy provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the bank holding company s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries 
various federal and state statutory provisions also limit the amount of dividends that subsidiary banks can pay to their holding companies without regulatory approval 
additionally  depending upon the circumstances  the fdic or the division could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
federal securities laws  sarbanes oxley act of the company is also subject to the periodic reporting  information disclosure  proxy solicitation  insider trading restrictions and other requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act as well as provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems  such as the regulation of the accounting profession  and regulation of the relationship between a board of directors and management and between a board of directors and its committees 
key components of the sarbanes oxley act are follows a prohibition on personal loans by the company to its directors and executive officers except loans made by the bank in accordance with federal banking regulations  
table of contents independence requirements for board audit committee members and the company s auditors  certification of exchange act reports by the chief executive officer  chief financial officer and principal accounting officer  disclosure of off balance sheet transactions  expedited reporting of stock transactions by insiders  and  increased criminal penalties for violations of securities laws 
the sarbanes oxley act also requires management to establish  maintain and evaluate disclosure controls and procedures  management to report on its annual assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting  and  the company s external auditor to attest to the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting 
the sec has adopted regulations to implement various provisions of the sarbanes oxley act  including disclosures in periodic filings pursuant to the exchange act 
also  in response to the sarbanes oxley act  nasdaq adopted new corporate governance standards for listed companies 
usa patriot act of under the usa patriot act of patriot act  adopted by the us congress on october  to combat terrorism  fdic insured banks and commercial banks are required to increase their due diligence efforts for correspondent accounts and private banking customers 
the patriot act requires the bank to engage in additional record keeping or reporting  requiring identification of owners of accounts  or of the customers of foreign banks with accounts  and restricting or prohibiting certain correspondent accounts 
emergency economic stabilization act of eesa 
eesa granted broad powers to the us department of the treasury  the fdic and the federal reserve to stabilize the financial markets under the following programs the capital purchase program allocated billion to treasury to purchase senior preferred shares and warrants to purchase commons stock from approved financial institutions  the troubled asset purchase program allocated billion to treasury to purchase troubled assets from financial institutions  with treasury to also receive securities issued by participating institutions  the temporary liquidity guaranty program authorized the fdic to insure newly issued senior unsecured debt and insure the total balance in non interest bearing transactional deposit accounts of those institutions who elect to participate  and the commercial paper and money market investor funding facilities authorized the federal reserve bank of new york to purchase rated commercial paper from us companies and to purchase money market instruments from us money market mutual funds 
recent legislation dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act 
as a result of the recent financial crises  on july   the dodd frank act was signed into law 
the dodd frank act is expected to have a broad impact on the financial services industry  including significant regulatory and compliance changes and changes to corporate governance matters affecting public companies 
many of the requirements called for in the dodd frank act will be implemented over time and most will be subject to implementing regulations over the course of several years 
among other things  the dodd frank act centralizes responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency responsible for implementing  examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws  
table of contents applies the same leverage and risk based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to bank holding companies  excludes the proceeds of trust preferred securities from tier capital except for trust preferred securities issued before may  by bank holding companies  like the company  with less than billion in assets at december   changes the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible capital  requires the sec to complete studies and develop rules or approve stock exchange rules regarding various investor protection issues  including shareholder access to the proxy process  and various matters pertaining to executive compensation and compensation committee oversight  makes permanent the  limit for federal deposit insurance and provides unlimited federal deposit insurance until december   for non interest bearing transaction accounts  removes prior restrictions on interstate de novo branching  repeals the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits  thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts  gives the fdic authority to unwind large failing financial firms  extends the fdic s transaction account guarantee tag program to december   authorizes banks to pay interest on business checking accounts  which is likely to significantly increase our interest expense  adopts various mortgage lending and predatory lending provisions  requires federal regulators jointly to prescribe regulations mandating that financial institutions with more than billion in assets to disclose to their regulators their incentive compensation plans to permit the regulators to determine whether the plans provide executive officers  employees  directors or principal shareholders with excessive compensation  fees or benefits  or could lead to material financial loss to the institution  and imposes a number of requirements related to executive compensation that apply to all public companies  such as prohibition of broker discretionary voting in connection with a shareholder vote on executive compensation  mandatory shareholder say on pay every one to three years and say on golden parachutes  and clawback of incentive compensation from current or former executive officers following any accounting restatement 
we anticipate that the dodd frank act  directly and indirectly  will impact the business of the company and the bank and increase compliance costs 
american recovery and reinvestment act of on february   the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra was signed into law 
arra is intended to help stimulate the economy through a combination of tax cuts and spending provisions applicable to a broad range of areas with an estimated cost of about billion 
arra also amended and enhanced executive compensation restrictions of eesa related to tarp capital purchase program participants 
overdrafts 
on november   the board of governors of the federal reserve system promulgated the electronic fund transfer rule with an effective date of january  and a mandatory compliance date of july  the rule  which applies to all fdic regulated institutions  prohibits financial institutions from assessing an overdraft fee for paying automated teller machine atm and one time point of sale debit card transactions  unless the customer affirmatively opts in to the overdraft service for those types of transactions 
the opt in provision establishes requirements for clear disclosure of fees and terms of overdraft services for atm and one time debit card transactions 
the rule could have an adverse impact on our non interest income 

table of contents effects of governmental monetary policies profitability in banking depends on interest rate differentials 
in general  the difference between the interest earned on a bank s loans  securities and other interest earning assets and the interest paid on a bank s deposits and other interest bearing liabilities is the major source of a bank s earnings 
thus  the earnings and growth of the company are affected not only by general economic conditions  but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states and its agencies  particularly the frb 
the frb implements national monetary policy for such purposes as controlling inflation and recession by its open market operations in united states government securities  control of the discount rate applicable to borrowing from the frb  and the establishment of reserve requirements against certain deposits 
the actions of the frb in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments and deposits  and also affect interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
the nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies and their impact on the company are not predictable 
item a 
risk factors historical performance may not be indicative of future performance and  as noted elsewhere in this report  the company has included forward looking statements about its business  plans and prospects that are subject to change 
forward looking statements are particularly located in  but not limited to  the sections item business and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to the other risks or uncertainties contained in this report  the following risks may affect operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
if any of these risks occur  either alone or in combination with other factors  the company s business  financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected 
moreover  readers should note this is not an exhaustive list  some risks are unknown or not quantifiable  and other risks that are currently perceived as immaterial may ultimately prove more significant than expected 
statements about plans  predictions or expectations should not be construed to be assurances of performance or promises to take a given course of action 
continued deterioration in the real estate market would lead to additional losses  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
approximately of the company s loan portfolio is secured by real estate  the majority of which is commercial real estate 
as a result of increased levels of commercial and consumer delinquencies and declining real estate values  the company has experienced higher levels of net charge offs and allowances for loan losses 
continued increases in commercial and consumer delinquency levels or continued declines in real estate market values would result in additional net charge offs and provision for loan losses  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations and prospects 
future loan losses may exceed the allowance for loan losses 
the company has established a reserve for possible losses expected in connection with loans in the credit portfolio 
this allowance reflects estimates of the collectability of certain identified loans  as well as an overall risk assessment of total loans outstanding 
the determination of the amount of loan loss allowance is subjective  although the method for determining the amount of the allowance uses criteria such as risk ratings and historical loss rates  these factors may not be adequate predictors of future loan performance 
accordingly  the company cannot offer assurances that these estimates ultimately will prove correct or that the loan loss allowance will be sufficient to protect against losses that ultimately may occur 
if the loan loss allowance proves to be inadequate  it may require unexpected charges to income  which would adversely impact results of operations and financial condition 
moreover  bank regulators frequently monitor banks loan loss allowances  and if regulators were to determine that the allowance was inadequate  they may require the company to increase the allowance  which also would adversely impact revenues and financial condition 

table of contents nonperforming assets take significant time and expense to resolve and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we expect to incur losses related to elevated levels of nonperforming loans 
we do not record interest income on nonaccrual loans  which adversely affects our income 
our loan administration costs increase as we attempt to resolve nonperforming loans and as we receive collateral through foreclosures or other proceedings 
increases in levels of nonperforming loans may impact the capital levels the fdic expects the bank to maintain 
defaults may negatively impact the company 
credit risk arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained if a significant number of borrowers  guarantors and related parties fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans 
the company has adopted underwriting and credit monitoring procedures and credit policies  including the establishment and review of the allowance for credit losses  which management believes are appropriate to minimize risk by assessing the likelihood of nonperformance  tracking loan performance and diversifying the credit portfolio 
these policies and procedures  however  may not prevent unexpected losses that could materially affect results of operations 
the company s operations are geographically concentrated in northwest washington state and therefore are affected by local economic conditions 
substantially  all of the company s business is derived from a five county area in northwest washington state 
employment opportunities within these communities have traditionally been primarily in the areas of military spending  oil and gas industries  tourism and manufacturing 
while the company s expansion strategy has been built around these growing and diverse geographic markets  the company s business is  and will remain  sensitive to economic factors that relate to these industries and to local and regional business conditions 
as a result  local or regional economic downturns  or downturns that disproportionately affect one or more of the key industries in the company s markets  may have a more pronounced effect upon the company s business than they might on an institution that is more broadly diverse in geographic concentration 
the extent of the future impact of these events on economic and business conditions cannot be predicted  however  prolonged or acute fluctuations could have a material and adverse impact upon the company s results of operation and financial condition 
there has been high unemployment and a decline in housing prices in the communities the bank serves 
if regional economic conditions do not improve  or worsen  we expect increased loan delinquencies and defaults  higher level of nonperforming assets and lower demand for our services 
fdic assisted acquisitions or assuming deposits from a troubled institutions present significant challenges in integration and failure to realize expected cost savings and synergies could have an adverse impact 
the company may make opportunistic whole or partial acquisitions of other banks  branches  financial institutions  or related businesses from time to time that it expects to further its business strategy 
these acquisitions could involve numerous risks  including lower than expected performance or higher than expected costs  difficulties related to integration  diversion of management s attention from other business activities  changes in relationships with customers  and the potential loss of key employees 
any possible acquisition will be subject to regulatory approval  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such approval 
the company may not be successful in identifying acquisition candidates  integrating acquired institutions  or preventing deposit erosion or loan quality deterioration at acquired institutions 
competition for acquisitions in the company s market area is highly competitive  and the company may not be able to acquire other institutions on attractive terms 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in completing or will even pursue future acquisitions  or if such transactions are completed  that it will be successful in integrating acquired businesses into its operations 
the company s ability to grow may be limited if it chooses not to pursue or are unable to successfully make acquisitions in the future 

table of contents a rapid change in interest rates could reduce the company s net interest margin  net interest income and fee income 
the company s earnings are impacted by changing interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the demand for new loans  the credit profile of existing loans  the rates received on loans and securities  and rates paid on deposits and borrowings 
the relationship between the rates received on loans and securities and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings is known as the net interest spread 
based on the company s current volume and mix of interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets  net interest spread could be expected to increase during times when interest rates rise in a parallel shift along the yield curve and  conversely  to decline during times of similar falling interest rates 
exposure to interest rate risk is managed by monitoring the re pricing frequency of rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities over any given period 
although management believes the current level of interest rate sensitivity is reasonable  significant fluctuations in interest rates could potentially have an adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
tightening of credit markets and liquidity needs could result in higher funding costs  adversely affecting net income 
liquidity measures the ability to meet loan demand and deposit withdrawals and to service liabilities as they come due 
dramatic fluctuations in loan or deposit balances make it challenging to manage liquidity 
a sharp reduction in deposits could force the company to borrow heavily in the wholesale deposit market 
in addition  rapid loan growth during periods of low liquidity could induce the company to purchase federal funds from correspondent banks  borrow at the federal home loan bank of seattle or federal reserve discount window  raise deposit interest rates or reduce lending activity 
wholesale deposits and federal funds or other sources for borrowings may not be available to us due to regulatory constraints  market upheaval or unfavorable terms 
slower than anticipated growth from new branches  service offerings or acquisitions could result in reduced net income 
financial performance and profitability will depend on the company s ability to manage recent growth and potential future growth 
in addition  any future acquisitions and continued growth may present operating and other problems that could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to execute its growth strategy or maintain the level of profitability that it has achieved in the past 
internal control systems could fail to detect certain events 
the company is subject to many operating risks  including but not limited to data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud 
there can be no assurance that such an event will not occur  and if such an event is not prevented or detected by other company s internal controls and does occur  and it is uninsured or is in excess of applicable insurance limits  it could have a significant adverse impact on the company s reputation in the business community and the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company s operations could be interrupted if third party service providers experience difficulty  terminate their services  or fail to comply with banking regulations 
the company depends  and will continue to depend to a significant extent  on a number of relationships with third party service providers 
specifically  the company utilizes software and hardware systems for processing  essential web hosting  debit and credit card processing  merchant processing  internet banking systems  and other processing services from third party service providers 
if these third party service providers experience difficulties or terminate their services  and the company is unable to replace them with other qualified service providers  the company s operations could be interrupted 
if an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time  the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents the network and computer systems on which the company depends could fail or experience a security breach 
the company s computer systems could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems 
because the company conducts part of its business over the internet and outsources several critical functions to third parties  operations depend on the company s ability  and to a degree on the ability of third party service providers to protect computer systems and network infrastructure against damage from fire  power loss  telecommunications failure  mechanical failure  software errors  operator errors  physical break ins  or similar catastrophic events 
any damage or failure that causes interruptions in operations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  a significant barrier to online financial transactions is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
the company s internet banking system relies on encryption and authentication technology to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of confidential information 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography  fraud perpetrated by a customer  employee  or third party  or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms the bank or our third party service providers use to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data  including non public customer information 
if any such compromise of security were to occur  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company may not be able to replace key members of management or attract and retain qualified employees in the future 
the company depends on the services of existing management to carry out its business strategies 
as the company expands  it will need to continue to attract and retain additional management and other qualified staff 
in particular  because the company plans to continue to expand its locations and products and services  it will need to continue to attract and retain qualified banking personnel 
competition for such personnel is significant in the company s geographic market areas 
the loss of the services of any management personnel  or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future  could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial conditions  and prospects 
the company s banking operations are subject to extensive government regulation that is expected to become more burdensome  increase its costs and make it less competitive compared to financial services firms that are not subject to the same regulation 
the company is subject to government regulation that could limit or restrict its activities  which in turn could adversely impact operations 
the financial services industry is regulated extensively 
federal and state regulation is designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers  as well as shareholders 
these regulations can sometimes impose significant limitations on operations 
moreover  federal and state banking laws and regulations undergo frequent  significant changes 
changes in laws and regulations may affect the cost of doing business  limit permissible activities including insurance and securities activities  or the company s competitive position in relation to credit unions  savings associations and other financial institutions 
these changes could also reduce federal deposit insurance coverage  broaden the powers or geographic range of financial holding companies  alter the taxation of financial institutions  and change the structure and jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies 
federal monetary policy  particularly as implemented through the federal reserve system  can significantly affect credit availability 
other federal legislation such as the sarbanes oxley act can dramatically shift resources and costs to ensure adequate compliance 
the dodd frank act  enacted in july  is expected to increase our overall costs of compliance and could lead to increased capital requirements  restrictions on income generating activities and new corporate governance and executive compensation reforms 

table of contents difficult market conditions have adversely affected the financial industry 
the capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than two years 
dramatic declines in the housing market over the past year  with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment  have negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage loans and resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions  including government sponsored entities 
these write downs have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital  to merge with larger and stronger institutions and  in some cases  to fail 
reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced or ceased providing funding to borrowers  including to other financial institutions 
this market turmoil and tightening of credit have led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies  lack of consumer confidence  increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity  generally 
the resulting economic pressure on consumers and lack of confidence in the financial markets has adversely affected business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company does not expect that the difficult conditions in the financial markets are likely to improve in the near future 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions in the financial services industry 
in particular  the following risks may be faced in connection with these events the company expects to face increased regulation of the industry  including as a result of the dodd frank act  eesa and arra 
compliance with such regulation may increase costs and limit the ability to pursue business opportunities 
government stimulus packages and other responses to the financial crises may not stabilize the economy or financial system 
the company s ability to assess the creditworthiness of customers may be impaired if the models and approaches the company uses to select  manage  and underwrite customers become less predictive of future behaviors 
the process the company uses to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure requires difficult  subjective  and complex judgments  including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic predictions might impair the ability of the bank s borrowers to repay their loans  which may no longer be capable of accurate estimation which may  in turn  impact the reliability of the process 
the company will be required to pay significantly higher federal deposit insurance corporation premiums because market developments have significantly depleted the insurance fund of the fdic and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits 
there may be downward pressure on the company s stock price 
the company s ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions and government sponsored entities 
the company may face increased competition due to intensified consolidation of the financial services industry 
if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience an adverse effect  which may be material  on the company s ability to access capital and on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the financial services industry is highly competitive 
competition may adversely affect the company s performance 
the financial services business is becoming increasingly competitive due to changes in regulation  technological advances  and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers 
the company faces competition both in attracting deposits and in originating loans 
competition for loan s principally through the pricing of interest rates and loan fees  and the efficiency and quality of services 
increasing levels of competition in the banking and financial services industries may reduce market share or cause the prices charged for services to fall 
results may differ in future periods depending upon the nature or level of competition 
we may be required to raise additional capital  which will depend on market conditions and the results of which could have a dilutive effect on existing shareholders 
our growth strategy may require additional capital 
also  continued elevated levels of nonperforming assets or higher regulatory capital requirements could require us to sell shares of our common stock 
shares of the company s common stock eligible for future sale  including those that may be issued in connection with the company s various stock option and equity compensation plans  in possible acquisitions  and any other offering of company s common stock for cash  could have a dilutive effect on the market for company s common stock and could adversely affect its market price 
there are  shares of company s common stock authorized  of which  shares were outstanding at december  at the time we need to raise capital  market conditions may be adverse and we run the risk of not being able to meet capital requirements set by regulators or necessary for growth 
the failure of the federal home loan bank fhlb of seattle or the national federal home loan bank system may have a material negative impact on the company s earnings and liquidity 
recently  the fhlb of seattle announced that it did not meet minimum regulatory capital requirements for the year ended december   due to the deterioration in the market value of their mortgage backed securities portfolio 
as a result  the fhlb of seattle cannot pay a dividend on their common stock and it cannot repurchase or redeem common stock 
while the fhlb of seattle has announced it does not anticipate that additional capital is immediately necessary  nor does it believe that its capital level is inadequate to support realized losses in the future  the fhlb of seattle could require its members  including the company  to contribute additional capital in order to return the fhlb of seattle to compliance with capital guidelines 
at december   the company held million of common stock in the fhlb of seattle 
should the fhlb of seattle fail  the company anticipates that its investment in the fhlb s common stock would be other than temporarily impaired and may have no value 
the fhlb has discontinued stock repurchases and dividends and we could be required to take an impairment charge on our fhlb stock holdings 
at december   the company held minimal cash on deposit with the fhlb of seattle 
at that date  all other cash and cash equivalents were held on deposit at the pacific coast banker s bank  the federal reserve bank of san francisco or on hand in branch office vaults 
at december   the company maintained a line of credit with the fhlb of seattle equal to of total assets to the extent the company provides qualifying collateral and holds sufficient fhlb stock 
at december   the company was in compliance with collateral requirements and million of the line of credit was available for additional borrowings 
the company is dependent on the fhlb of seattle as a source of wholesale funding for immediate liquidity and borrowing needs 
the failure of the fhlb of seattle or the fhlb system in general  may materially impair the company s ability to meet its growth plans or to meet short and long term liquidity demands 

table of contents changes in accounting standards may impact how the company reports its financial condition and results of operations 
the company s accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how it records and reports its financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time  the financial accounting standards board changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the company s financial statements 
these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how the company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  the company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively  resulting in a restatement of prior period financial statements 
if we inaccurately determine the fair value of assets acquired  including the fdic loss sharing assets  our business  financial condition  results of operations  and future prospects we could be materially and adversely affected 
management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of acquired loans  including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of secured loans 
in fdic assisted acquisitions that include loss sharing agreements  we may record a loss sharing asset that we consider adequate to absorb the indemnified portion of future losses which may occur in the acquired loan portfolio 
the fdic loss sharing asset is accounted for on the same basis as the related acquired loans and oreo and primarily represents the present value of the cash flows the company expects to collect from the fdic under the loss sharing agreements 
if our assumptions are incorrect  significant earnings volatility can occur and the balance of the fdic loss sharing asset may at any time be insufficient to cover future loan losses  and credit loss provisions may be needed to respond to different economic conditions or adverse developments in the acquired loan portfolio 
any increase in future loan losses could have a negative effect on our operating results 
fdic assisted acquisition opportunities may not become available and increased competition may make it more difficult for us to successfully bid on failed bank transactions 
a part of our growth strategy is to pursue failing banks that the fdic plans to place in receivership 
the fdic may not place banks that meet our strategic objectives into receivership 
failed bank transactions are attractive opportunities because of loss sharing arrangements with the fdic and our ability to determine the non deposit liabilities that we assume 
the bidding process for failing banks could become very competitive and the fdic does not provide information about bids until after the failing bank has been closed 
we may not be able to match or beat the bids of other acquirers unless we bid aggressively by increasing the premium paid on assumed deposits or reducing the discount bid on assets purchased  which could make the acquisition less attractive to us 
if the goodwill we have recorded in connection with acquisitions becomes impaired  it could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
accounting standards require that we account for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting 
we evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists 
such evaluation is based on a variety of factors  including the quoted price of our common stock  market prices of common stock of other banking organizations  common stock trading multiples  discounted cash flows  and data from comparable acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that future evaluations of goodwill will not result in impairment and ensuing write down  which could be material  resulting in an adverse impact on our earnings and capital 
the fdic has increased insurance premiums to restore and maintain the federal deposit insurance fund  which has increased our costs and could adversely affect our business 
in  the fdic imposed a special deposit insurance assessment of five basis points on all insured institutions  and also required insured institutions to prepay estimated quarterly risk based assessments through the 
table of contents dodd frank act established as the minimum deposit insurance fund reserve ratio 
the fdic has determined that the fund reserve ratio should be and has adopted a plan under which it will meet the statutory minimum fund reserve ratio of by the deadline of september  the dodd frank act requires the fdic to offset the effect on institutions with assets less than billion of the increase in the statutory minimum fund reserve ratio to from the former statutory minimum of 
the deposit insurance fund will likely suffer additional losses in the future due to failures of insured institutions 
there can be no assurance that there will not be additional significant deposit insurance premium increases  special assessments or prepayments 
any significant premium increases or special assessments could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to receive dividends from our banking subsidiary could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends 
the company is a separate and distinct legal entity from the bank 
we receive substantially all of our revenue from dividends from our banking subsidiary 
in addition to capital raised at the holding company level  dividends from the bank are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common stock and principal and interest on our outstanding debt 
federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the bank may pay to the company 
limitations on our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiary could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and on our ability to pay dividends on common stock 
additionally  if the bank s earnings are not sufficient to make dividend payments to the company while maintaining adequate capital levels  we may not be able to make dividend payments to our common shareholders or principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt 
significant legal or regulatory actions could subject us to substantial uninsured liabilities 
we are from time to time subject to claims and proceedings related to our operations 
in addition we could become subject to supervisory or enforcement actions by regulators  or criminal proceedings by prosecutorial authorities 
in addition to defense costs  if we are subject large monetary penalties or fines as a result of such claims or proceedings  we would suffer adverse financial consequences and reputational harm 
our insurance coverage does not cover any civil money penalties or fines imposed by government authorities and may not cover all other claims that might be brought against us or continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost
