item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of many factors  including the factors we describe under item a risk factors  and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading provider of low cost communications services connecting people through broadband devices worldwide 
we rely heavily on our network  which is a flexible  scalable session initiation protocol sip based voice over internet protocol  or voip  network that rides on top of the internet 
this platform enables a user via a single identity  either a number or user name  to access and utilize services and features regardless of how they are connected to the internet  including over g  g  cable  or dsl broadband networks 
this technology enables us to offer attractively priced services that provide our customers with access to vonage voice  messaging  and features  regardless of location  device  or their form of internet access 
our customers include both domestic and international long distance callers  which we classify as customers who that make or more minutes of international long distance calls per month within their plan 
our primary product offering is vonage world  a residential plan with unlimited calling domestically and to more than countries  including india  mexico  and china  for a flat monthly rate 
we introduced our first mobile offering in late  an outbound long distance calling application  and vonage mobile for facebook in august  enabling inbound and outbound calling to a user s facebook friends 
we anticipate leveraging our technology to offer additional applications for mobile and other connected devices to address large existing markets 
in december  we completed the refinancing of our outstanding notes payable 
the terms of the new loan include significantly lower interest rates and less restrictive covenants than the prior debt 
we believe this refinancing helps to de risk the business by simplifying the complex covenant structure and it gives us greater flexibility to deploy the cash generated by our business 
we serviced approximately million subscriber lines as of december  subscribers can sign up through our direct sales channel  as represented by web sites and toll free numbers  or purchase devices at our regional and national retailers  including walmart and fry s electronics 
our primary source of revenue is subscription fees that we charge customers for our service plans  primarily on a monthly basis 
we also generate revenue from call usage that is not included in customers service plans and for additional features that customers add to their service plans 
we bill customers in the united states  canada  and the united kingdom 
customers in the united states represented of our subscriber lines at december  trends in our industry and key operating data a number of trends in our industry have a significant effect on our results of operations and are important to an understanding of our financial statements 
the table below includes key operating data that our management uses to measure the growth and operating performance of our business for the years ended december  gross subscriber line additions change in net subscriber lines subscriber lines at period end average monthly customer churn average monthly revenue per line average monthly telephony services revenue per line average monthly direct cost of telephony services per line marketing costs per gross subscriber line addition employees excluding temporary help at period end broadband adoption 
the number of united states households with broadband internet access has grown significantly 
on march   the federal communications commission fcc released its national broadband plan  which seeks  through supporting broadband deployment and programs  to encourage broadband adoption for the approximately million united states residents who do not have broadband at home 
we expect the trend of greater broadband adoption to continue 
we benefit from this trend because our service requires a broadband internet connection and our potential addressable market increases as broadband adoption increases 
competitive landscape 
we face intense competition from traditional telephone companies  wireless companies  cable companies  and alternative voice communication providers 
vonage annual report 
table of contents most traditional wire line and wireless telephone service providers and cable companies are substantially larger and better capitalized than we are and have the advantage of a large existing customer base 
in addition  because our competitors provide other services  they often choose to offer voip services or other voice services as part of a bundle that includes other products  such as video  high speed internet access  and wireless telephone service  which we do not offer 
further  as wireless providers offer more minutes at lower prices  better coverage  and companion landline alternative services  their services have become more attractive to households as a replacement for wire line service 
we also compete against alternative voice communication providers  such as skype  google voice  magicjack  and independent voip service providers 
some of these service providers have chosen to sacrifice telephony revenue in order to gain market share and have offered their services at low prices or for free 
as we continue to introduce applications that integrate different forms of voice and messaging services over multiple devices  we are likely to face competition from emerging competitors focused on similar integration  as well as from established alternative voice communication providers 
in addition  our competitors have partnered and may in the future partner with other competitors to offer products and services  leveraging their collective competitive positions 
we also are subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies 
gross subscriber line additions 
gross subscriber line additions for a particular period are calculated by taking the net subscriber line additions during that particular period and adding to that the number of subscriber lines that terminated during that period 
this number does not include subscriber lines both added and terminated during the period  where termination occurred within the first days after activation 
the number does include  however  subscriber lines added during the period that are terminated within days of activation but after the end of the period 
net subscriber line additions 
net subscriber line additions for a particular period reflect the number of subscriber lines at the end of the period  less the number of subscriber lines at the beginning of the period 
subscriber lines 
our subscriber lines include  as of a particular date  all subscriber lines from which a customer can make an outbound telephone call on that date 
our subscriber lines include fax lines and soft phones but do not include our virtual phone numbers or toll free numbers  which only allow inbound telephone calls to customers 
subscriber lines decreased from  as of december  to  as of december  in the fourth quarter of  we added  net subscriber lines 
we believe that the decrease in our subscriber lines for the year was primarily due to increasing wireless substitution  other competition  particularly from cable companies  and reduced marketing spending 
the increase in net subscriber lines in the fourth quarter was primarily due to further penetration of international calling markets and stable churn 
we expect more gross lines in compared to and positive net subscriber lines in average monthly customer churn 
average monthly customer churn for a particular period is calculated by dividing the number of customers that terminated during that period by the simple average number of customers during the period  and dividing the result by the number of months in the period 
the simple average number of customers during the period is the number of customers on the first day of the period  plus the number of customers on the last day of the period  divided by two 
terminations  as used in the calculation of churn statistics  do not include customers terminated during the period if termination occurred within the first days after activation 
our average monthly customer churn decreased to in from in in the fourth quarter of  our average monthly customer churn was 
we believe the reduction in churn is due to initiatives to improve the customer s experience  including on boarding and network quality  an improving economy and credit profile for new customer acquisitions  which has positively impacted non pay churn  and the value proposition of the vonage world offer 
we monitor churn on a daily basis and use it as an indicator of the level of customer satisfaction 
other companies may calculate churn differently  and their churn data may not be directly comparable to ours 
customers who have been with us for a year or more tend to have a lower churn rate than customers who have not 
our churn will fluctuate over time due to economic conditions  competitive pressures including wireless substitution  market place perception of our services  and our ability to provide high quality customer care and network quality and add future innovative products and services 
average monthly revenue per line 
average monthly revenue per line for a particular period is calculated by dividing our total revenue for that period by the simple average number of subscriber lines for the period  and dividing the result by the number of months in the period 
the simple average number of subscriber lines for the period is the number of subscriber lines on the first day of the period  plus the number of subscriber lines on the last day of the period  divided by two 
our average monthly revenue per line increased to for compared to for average monthly telephony services revenue per line 
average monthly telephony services revenue per line for a particular period is calculated by dividing our total telephony services revenue for that period by the simple average number of subscriber lines for the period  and dividing the result by the number of months in the period 
our average monthly telephony services revenue per line was for compared with for this increase was due to an increase in the number of customers signing up for higher priced rate plans  selective pricing actions we implemented along with enhancements to our service  and improved customer quality that reduced bad debt costs 
average monthly direct cost of telephony services per line 
average monthly direct cost of telephony services per line for a particular period is calculated by dividing our direct cost of telephony services for that period by the simple average number of subscriber lines for the period  and dividing the result by the number of months in the period 
we use the average monthly direct cost of telephony services per line to evaluate how effective we are at managing our costs of providing service 
our average monthly direct cost of telephony services per line increased to for compared to for  due primarily to higher costs from higher international call volume associated with vonage world  partially offset by more favorable rates negotiated with our service providers 
direct cost of telephony services both overall and on a per line basis is expected to continue to increase in the drivers of this increase are international calling by our growing base of vonage world customers and potential regulatory termination charges in certain high volume countries 

table of contents marketing cost per gross subscriber line addition 
marketing cost per gross subscriber line addition is calculated by dividing our marketing expense for a particular period by the number of gross subscriber line additions during the period 
marketing expense does not include the cost of certain customer acquisition activities  such as rebates and promotions  which are accounted for as an offset to revenues  or customer equipment subsidies  which are accounted for as direct cost of goods sold 
as a result  it does not represent the full cost to us of obtaining a new customer 
our marketing cost per gross subscriber line addition increased to for from in  due primarily to a reduction in gross subscriber line additions compared to the prior year 
employees 
employees represent the number of personnel that are on our payroll and exclude temporary or outsourced labor 
regulation 
our business has developed in a relatively lightly regulated environment 
the united states and other countries  however  are examining how voip services should be regulated 
the november order by the fcc in response to a request by kansas and nebraska that permits states to impose state universal service fund obligations on voip service  discussed in note to our financial statements  is an example of efforts by regulators to determine how voip service fits into the telecommunications regulatory landscape 
in addition to regulatory matters that directly address voip  a number of other regulatory initiatives could impact our business 
one such regulatory initiative is net neutrality 
in december  the fcc adopted a revised set of net neutrality rules for broadband internet service providers 
these rules make it more difficult for broadband internet service providers to block or discriminate against vonage service 
several broadband internet service providers have filed appeals of the fcc s new rules at the dc circuit court of appeals alleging that the fcc lacks authority to apply its rules to broadband internet service providers 
see also the discussion under regulation in note to our financial statements for a discussion of certain other regulatory issues that impact us 
operating revenues operating revenues consists of telephony services revenue and customer equipment and shipping revenue 
telephony services revenue 
substantially all of our operating revenues are telephony services revenue 
in the united states  we currently offer five residential plans  vonage world  residential premium unlimited  vonage pro  basic  and vonage lite 
we also offer two mobile plans  vonage world mobile and vonage mobile pay per use  and two small office and home office calling plans  small business premium unlimited minutes and small business basic minutes 
each of our unlimited plans other than our vonage world plan offers unlimited domestic calling as well as unlimited calling to puerto rico  canada  and selected european countries  subject to certain restrictions 
each of our basic plans offers a limited number of domestic calling minutes per month 
we also offer international calling plans that are bundled with our residential premium unlimited plan and enable a customer to make calls to a chosen international region 
we offer similar plans in canada and the united kingdom 
the vonage world plan  now available in the united states and canada  offers unlimited calling across the united states and puerto rico  unlimited international calling to over sixty countries including india  mexico  and canada  subject to certain restrictions  and free voicemail to text messages with vonage visual voicemail 
under our basic plans  we charge on a per minute basis when the number of domestic calling minutes included in the plan is exceeded for a particular month 
international calls except for calls to puerto rico  canada and certain european countries under our unlimited plans and a variety of countries under international calling plans and vonage world are charged on a per minute basis 
these per minute fees are not included in our monthly subscription fees 
in october  we launched vonage mobile  our first mobile calling application for smart phones 
vonage mobile is a free downloadable application that provides seamless  low cost pay per use international calling while on wi fi or cellular networks  depending on the device 
in december  we began offering vonage world mobile using this mobile calling application 
bundle discounts are provided for customers who subscribe to both our residential and mobile vonage world plans 
in september  we launched the vonage world canada plan  the first calling plan in canada to offer unlimited international calls to landlines in over countries for a flat rate 
we derive most of our telephony services revenue from monthly subscription fees that we charge our customers under our service plans 
we also offer residential fax service  virtual phone numbers  toll free numbers and other services  and charge an additional monthly fee for each service 
one business fax line is included with each of our two small office and home office plans  but we charge monthly fees for additional business fax lines 
we automatically charge these fees to our customers credit cards  debit cards  and electronic check payments  or ecp  monthly in advance 
we also automatically charge the per minute fees not included in our monthly subscription fees to our customers credit cards  debit cards or ecp monthly in arrears unless they exceed a certain dollar threshold  in which case they are charged immediately 
by collecting monthly subscription fees in advance and certain other charges immediately after they are incurred  we are able to reduce the amount of accounts receivable that we have outstanding  thus allowing us to have lower working capital requirements 
collecting in this manner also helps us mitigate bad debt losses  which are recorded as a reduction to revenue 
if a customer s credit card  debit card or ecp is declined  we generally suspend international calling capabilities as well as the customer s ability to incur domestic usage charges in excess of their plan minutes 
historically  in most cases  we are able to correct the problem with the customer within the current monthly billing cycle 
if the customer s credit card  debit card or ecp could not be successfully processed during three billing cycles ie  the current and two subsequent monthly billing cycles  we terminate the account 
from time to time we have generated revenue by charging a fee for activating service  although we do not currently charge or expect to charge an activation fee to customers 
in these instances when no activation fee is being collected  no customer acquisition costs are deferred 
customer activation fees when collected  along with the related incremental direct customer acquisition amounts for customer equipment in the direct channel and for rebates and retailer commissions in the retail channel  up to but not exceeding the activation fee  are deferred and amortized over the estimated average customer relationship period customer life 
the amortization of deferred customer equipment is recorded to direct cost of goods sold 
the amortization of deferred rebates is recorded as a reduction of telephony services vonage annual report 
table of contents revenues 
the amortization of deferred retailer commissions is recorded as marketing expense 
this customer life is solely used to amortize deferred activation fees collected  which we have waived for almost all new customers since may  including those signing up for our vonage world plan  along with the related incremental customer acquisition costs 
customers signing up for our vonage world plan currently churn at lower rates than other customers  and therefore appear to have a longer customer life 
because these customers have not paid an activation fee  this does not impact the customer life used in determining the amortization period 
the customer life is months for and was months in for  the customer life will remain at months based on consistent historical trends 
the impact of these changes to the customer life was not material to the consolidated results of operations 
in the united states  we charge regulatory recovery fees on a monthly basis to defray the costs associated with regulatory consulting and compliance as well as related litigation  e compliance  and to cover taxes that we are charged by the suppliers of telecommunications services 
in addition  we recognize revenue on a gross basis for contributions to the federal universal service fund  or usf  and related fees 
all other taxes are recorded on a net basis 
in addition  in some cases we charge a disconnect fee for customers who terminate their service plan within the first twelve months of service 
disconnect fees are recorded as revenue and are recognized at the time the customer terminates service 
beginning in september  we eliminated the disconnect fee for new customers 
telephony services revenue is offset by the cost of certain customer acquisition activities  such as rebates and promotions 
customer equipment and shipping revenue 
customer equipment and shipping revenue consists of revenue from sales of customer equipment to our wholesalers or directly to customers and retailers 
in addition  customer equipment and shipping revenue includes the fees  when collected  that we charge our customers for shipping any equipment to them 
in addition  in some cases we charge an equipment recovery fee for customers who terminate their service plan within the first twelve months of service 
equipment recovery fees are recorded as revenue and are recognized at the time the customer terminates service 
beginning in september  we eliminated the equipment recovery fee for new customers

total direct cost of telephony services 
total direct cost of telephony services primarily consists of fees that we pay to third parties on an ongoing basis in order to provide our services 
these fees include access charges that we pay to other telephone companies to terminate domestic and international calls on the public switched telephone network 
these costs represented approximately and of our total direct cost of telephony services for and  respectively  with a portion of these payments ultimately being made to incumbent telephone companies 
when a vonage subscriber calls another vonage subscriber  we do not pay an access charge 
the cost of leasing internet transit services from multiple internet service providers 
this internet connectivity is used to carry voip session initiation signaling and packetized audio media between our subscribers and our regional data centers 
the cost of leasing from other telephone companies the telephone numbers that we provide to our customers 
we lease these telephone numbers on a monthly basis 
the cost of co locating our regional data connection point equipment in third party facilities owned by other telephone companies  internet service providers or collocation facility providers 
the cost of providing local number portability  which allows customers to move their existing telephone numbers from another provider to our service 
only regulated telecommunications providers have access to the centralized number databases that facilitate this process 
because we are not a regulated telecommunications provider  we must pay other telecommunications providers to process our local number portability requests 
the cost of complying with the fcc regulations regarding voip emergency services  which require us to provide enhanced emergency dialing capabilities to transmit calls for all of our customers 
taxes that we pay on our purchase of telecommunications services from our suppliers or imposed by government agencies such as federal usf and related fees

table of contents telephony services revenue 
telephony services revenue generally has been flat on a quarterly basis with the exception of the first and second quarters of the increases in telephony services revenue in the first and second quarters of were related to fewer service credits due to programs implemented in  lower bad debt due to improved collections and fewer delinquent accounts  and slightly higher usf fees 
customer equipment and shipping revenue 
customer equipment and shipping revenue was lower in the second through fourth quarters of due to the introduction of a new promotion in may that eliminated equipment and shipping fees for customers who signed up for our residential unlimited plan 
in  customer equipment and shipping revenue was lower than due to lower equipment recovery fees from fewer terminations 
in addition  during the third quarter of  a  reserve was made to cover potential refunds in connection with the proposed settlement of the consumer class action litigation see item legal proceedings 
direct cost of telephony services 
direct cost of telephony services beginning in the fourth quarter of through the second quarter of increased as expected due call termination costs from higher international call volume following the introduction of our vonage world plan 
in the third and fourth quarters of  these increases in call volumes have been partially offset by more favorable rates negotiated with our service providers resulting in lower direct cost of telephony services 
direct cost of goods sold 
the change in direct cost of goods sold expenses between the quarters was due to fluctuations in subscriber line additions 
in and  the amortization of deferred customer equipment costs has generally diminished as historical amounts have been fully amortized and have not been replaced with new deferred costs due to the introduction of a new promotion in may that eliminated activation fees and thus the corresponding cost deferral for customers who signed up for our residential unlimited plan or our vonage world plan 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses generally have decreased on a quarterly basis as a result of our cost management initiatives 
in  selling  general and administrative cost declined primarily due to a decrease in professional fees and lower selling expenses due to a reduction in the number of kiosk locations 
the further reduction in selling  general and administrative cost in was primarily due to a decrease in outsourced customer care costs and professional fees 
marketing 
marketing expense declined throughout as we completed the transition to our new agencies and continued the development of new advertising and eliminated inefficient non media spending 
in  marketing expense was relatively flat as we allocated a fixed marketing spend across channels based upon performance as we continued to refine our marketing strategy

summary of critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following describes our critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including the following those related to the average period of service to a customer the customer life used to amortize deferred revenue and deferred customer acquisition costs associated with customer activation  the useful lives of property and equipment  software costs  and intangible assets  assumptions used for the purpose of determining share based compensation and the fair value of our stock warrant using the black scholes option pricing model model  and various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable 
the key inputs for this model are our stock price at valuation date  exercise price  the dividend yield  risk free interest rate  life in years  and historical volatility of our common stock  assumptions used to determine the fair value of the embedded conversion option within our convertible notes using the monte carlo simulation model 
the key inputs are maturity date  risk free interest rate  our stock price at valuation date  and historical volatility of our common stock  and assumptions used to determine the fair value of the embedded make whole premium feature within our prior first lien senior facility and our prior second lien senior facility 
we base our estimates on historical experience  available market information  appropriate valuation methodologies  and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
revenue recognition operating revenues consist of telephony services revenues and customer equipment which enables our telephony services and shipping revenues 
the point in time at which revenues are recognized is determined in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition 
substantially all of our operating revenues are telephony services revenues  which are derived primarily from monthly subscription fees that customers are charged under our service plans 
we also derive telephony services revenues from per minute fees for international calls and for any calling minutes in excess of a customer s monthly plan limits 
monthly subscription fees are automatically charged to customers credit cards  debit cards or electronic check payments or ecp in advance and are recognized over the following month when services are provided 
revenues generated from international calls and from customers exceeding allocated call minutes under limited minute plans are recognized as services are provided  that is  as minutes are used  and are billed to a customer s credit cards  debit cards or ecp in arrears 
as a result of our multiple billing cycles each month  we estimate the amount of revenues earned from international calls and from customers exceeding allocated call minutes under limited minute plans but not billed from the end of each billing cycle to the end of each reporting period 
these estimates are based primarily upon historical minutes and have been consistent with our actual results 
from time to time we have generated revenue by charging a fee for activating service  although we do not currently or expect to charge an activation fee to customers 
in these instances when no activation fee is being collected  no customer acquisition costs are deferred 
customer activation fees when collected  along with the related incremental direct customer acquisition amounts for customer equipment in the direct channel and for rebates and retailer commissions in the retail channel  up to but not exceeding the activation fee  are deferred and amortized over the estimated average customer life 
the amortization of deferred customer equipment is recorded to direct cost of goods sold 
the amortization of deferred rebates is recorded as a reduction of telephony services revenues 
the amortization of deferred retailer commissions is recorded as marketing expense 
we estimate customer life by analyzing historical trends and applying those trends to future periods 
this customer life is solely used to amortize deferred activation fees collected  along with the related incremental customer acquisition costs 
the average customer life 
table of contents was months in  months in  and months in for  the average customer life will remain at months based on consistent historical trends 
the impact of these changes to the average customer life was not material to the consolidated results of operations 
we also provide rebates to customers who purchase their customer equipment from retailers and satisfy minimum service period requirements 
these rebates in excess of activation fees are recorded as a reduction of revenues over the service period based upon the estimated number of customers that will ultimately earn and claim the rebates 
customer equipment and shipping revenues include sales to our retailers  who subsequently resell this customer equipment to customers 
revenues were reduced for payments to retailers and rebates to customers  who purchased their customer equipment through these retailers  to the extent of customer equipment and shipping revenues 
inventory inventory consists of the cost of customer equipment and is stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the average cost method 
we provide an inventory allowance for customer equipment that has been returned by customers but may not be able to be reissued to new customers or returned to the manufacturer for credit 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using tax rates in effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse 
we have recorded a valuation allowance on the assumption that it is more likely than not that we will not generate taxable income in the future

the section limitation is applied annually so as to limit the use of our pre change net operating loss carryforwards to an amount that generally equals the value of our stock immediately before the ownership change multiplied by a designated federal long term tax exempt rate 
due to the cumulative impact of our equity issuances over the three year period ended april  a change of ownership occurred upon the issuance of our previously outstanding series e preferred stock at the end of april as a result   of the total united states net operating losses were subject to an annual base limitation of  share based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with fasb asc  compensation stock compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this pronouncement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award  reduced as appropriate based on estimated forfeitures  and is recognized as expense over the applicable vesting period of the stock award using the accelerated method
