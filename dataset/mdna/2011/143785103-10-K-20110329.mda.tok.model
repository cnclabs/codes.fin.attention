item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations 
because we have no material operations and conduct no business on our own other than owning our subsidiaries  carolina bank and carolina capital trust  and because carolina capital trust has no operations other than the issuance of its trust preferred securities  the discussion contained in this management s discussion and analysis concerns primarily the business of carolina bank 
carolina bank also owns two limited liability companies for the purpose of holding foreclosed real estate  of which the assets and operations of these subsidiaries are consolidated into carolina bank and included herein 
for ease of reading and because the financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis  carolina bank holdings  inc and carolina bank are collectively referred to herein as we  our  or us  unless otherwise noted 
forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements with respect to our financial condition and results of operations and business 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and are based on our beliefs and assumptions and on information available at the time these statements and disclosures were prepared 
factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expected include the following general economic conditions may deteriorate and negatively impact the ability of our borrowers to repay loans and our depositors to maintain balances 
changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income 
competitive pressures among financial institutions may increase 
legislative or regulatory changes  including changes in accounting standards  may adversely affect the businesses in which we are engaged 
new products developed and new methods of delivering products could result in a reduction in our business and income 
increases in interest rates  increases in warranty losses  or changes in the securitization of mortgages could negatively impact our mortgage banking income 
adverse changes may occur in the securities market 
local  state or federal taxing authorities may take tax positions that are adverse to us 
unpredictable natural and other disasters could have an adverse effect on our operations or on the willingness of our customers to access our financial services 
critical accounting policies our accounting and financial policies are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices in the banking industry 
the more critical accounting and reporting policies include our accounting for the allowance for loan losses 
our accounting policies relating to the allowance for loan losses involve the use of estimates and require significant judgment 
these estimates are based on our opinion of an amount that is adequate to absorb losses in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based on available information including the composition of the loan portfolio  historical loan losses  specific impaired loans  availability and quality of collateral  age of the various portfolios  changes in local economic conditions  and loan performance and quality of the portfolio 
different assumptions used in evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses could result in material changes in our consolidated financial condition or consolidated financial results of operations 
the methodology we employ to determine the allowance for loan losses involves a number of assumptions and estimates about uncertain matters 
we periodically review our assumptions and methodology 

table of contents comparison of financial condition assets 
our total assets decreased by million or from million at december   to million at december  during  interest bearing deposits with banks decreased million to million  and investment securities decreased by million to million 
we attempt to maintain adequate liquidity to meet our loan demand and other obligations 
loans held for sale increased in to million due to strong originations by our mortgage loan division  which began operations in and expanded each year through low mortgage rates and refinancing activity accounted for much of the increased volume in loans held for investment decreased by million or during  primarily from loan charge offs and repossessions 
carolina bank  which makes both commercial and retail loans  experienced slow loan demand in due to declining economic conditions in its primary lending markets  guilford  randolph  alamance  and forsyth counties  north carolina 
the compounded annual growth rate for the five years ending december  for loans held for investment and assets was and  respectively 
liabilities 
total liabilities decreased by million or from million at december   to million at december  deposits decreased by million  or  during as noninterest bearing balances increased while interest bearing balances declined 
the decline in deposits in was a result of pricing and the lack of asset growth which would require additional liquidity 
the compounded annual growth rate for the five years ending december  for deposits was 
long term  we plan to continue our efforts to gain deposits through quality service  convenient locations  and competitive pricing 
while deposit growth is an ongoing goal  wholesale sources of funding such as federal home loan bank advances and repurchase borrowings  may be utilized where cost beneficial and when necessary to meet liquidity requirements 
federal home loan bank advances decreased million during to million at december  stockholders equity 
our total stockholders equity decreased million at december  to million from million at december   primarily from the net loss allocable to common shareholders of million realized in asset quality our non performing assets  composed of foreclosed real estate and other repossessed assets  non accrual loans and non performing restructured loans  totaled million at december   compared to million at december  non performing assets  as a percentage of total assets  were and at december  and  respectively

impaired loans that were still performing decreased to million at december  from million at december  in general  loans are impaired when  based on current information and events  collection of all contractual amounts due is not probable 
the increase in non performing assets and loan charge offs in and resulted from the economic recession and deteriorating asset values in our markets 
the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in north carolina was in december and in december our primary lending market in the piedmont triad experienced slightly higher unemployment rates than the north carolina average in the past two years 
the deteriorating economic conditions in our markets have negatively impacted our borrowers  particularly developers and builders 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the objective of our liquidity management is to ensure the availability of sufficient cash flows to meet all financial commitments and to capitalize on opportunities for expansion 
liquidity management addresses our ability to meet deposit withdrawals on demand or at contractual maturity  to repay borrowings as they mature  and to fund new loans and investments as opportunities arise 
our primary sources of internally generated funds are principal and interest payments on loans receivable and cash flows generated from operations 
external sources of funds include increases in deposits  repurchase agreements  federal funds purchased from banks and advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
carolina bank is required under applicable federal regulations to maintain specified levels of liquid investments in qualifying types of investments 
cash and due from banks  interest bearing deposits with banks  and investment securities available for sale are the primary liquid assets of carolina bank 
we regularly monitor carolina bank s liquidity position to ensure its liquidity is sufficient to meet its needs 
during  we decreased our levels of short term liquidity and investment securities to fund the increased volume of residential mortgage loans that are held for sale 
since december   mortgage lending has declined and short term liquidity and investment securities have increased as loans held for sale have declined 
we also increased our secondary sources of liquidity during as our credit availability for additional advances from the federal home loan bank and available discount borrowings from the federal reserve exceeded million at december  we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the banking regulatory agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate mandatory and possibly discretionary actions by the regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on our financial condition 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
our capital amounts and classifications are subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
as of december  and  our levels of capital exceeded all applicable published regulatory requirements 
carolina bank plans to increase tier capital to average assets to in through earnings and moderate asset growth in response to regulatory requests subsequent to december  tier capital to average assets was for carolina bank at december  due to our growth in recent years  the recent difficult economic environment  increased regulatory capital requirements  and our anticipation of continued growth  we issued million in preferred stock to the united states treasury under the capital purchase program in january to increase our capital which could further support future growth and assist us to meet future regulatory capital requirements 
results of operations for the years ended december  and general 
we had a net loss of million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
net loss allocable to common stockholders was million or per diluted share  for compared to a net loss allocable to common stockholders of million  or per diluted share  in net loss allocable to common stockholders represents net loss less the preferred stock dividends and related discount accretion 
the increase in the net loss was primarily due to a higher provision for loan losses  higher impairments of repossessed assets  and higher repossessed asset expenses due to declining credit conditions and deteriorating asset values in our markets during net 
table of contents interest income  the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest incurred on interest bearing liabilities  was million in compared to million in  an increase of 
non interest income  principally service charges and fees  mortgage banking income  increase in cash value of life insurance  plus gain on sale of investments amounted to million in and million in our provision for loan losses was million and million in and  respectively 
the elevated level of our non performing loans at december  and increased loan charge offs in as well as declining economic conditions in our markets resulted in the large increase in the provision for loan losses in we incurred non interest expense of million in and million in the increase in non interest expense of million or was largely the result of repossessed asset expenses and impairments and higher expenses in the mortgage division which generated increased operating income 
the income tax benefit was million in compared to million in due to a higher loss before income taxes in the commercial retail bank segment reported a net loss of million  primarily due to higher provisions for loan losses and higher impairments and expenses on repossessed assets 
our mortgage division reported net income of million due to lower mortgage rates and expanded operations 
net interest income 
net interest income is the amount of interest earned on interest earning assets such as loans  investments  and interest earning deposits in other financial institutions less the interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities such as interest bearing deposits and borrowed money 
net interest income is the principal source of our earnings 
net interest income is affected by the general level of interest rates  competition  and the volumes and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
for the year ended december   net interest income increased by million or to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in net interest income was attributable to growth in average interest earning assets and liabilities and from an increase in the net yield on interest earning assets 
average interest earning assets were approximately million in compared to million in  an increase of million or 
although assets and liabilities were down at december  from december   average loans  average loans held for sale  and average interest bearing liabilities increased in from by million  million  and million  respectively 
the net yield on average interest earning assets was in and in the interest rate spread was in and in the increase in the net yield on interest earning assets and the interest rate spread in resulted from growth in average loans and deposits and from a greater drop in the cost of deposits and other borrowings than the drop in rates earned on interest earning assets

the increase in non interest bearing demand deposits had a positive impact on net interest income in while the increase in non interest earning assets such as repossessed assets had a negative impact on net interest income in provision for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses  established through charges to expense in the form of a provision for loan losses  allows for known and expected loan losses in our loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses increased in to million from million in  primarily because of higher nonperforming loans and related charge offs in declining real estate values and tepid demand for new real estate negatively impacted the ability of many of our borrowers to make loan payments in resulting in significant increases in loan charge offs  non performing loans  and impaired 
table of contents loans 
the level of the allowance for loan losses is based on our estimate as to the amount required to maintain an allowance adequate enough to provide for known and expected losses 
we consider  among other things  nonperforming loans  impaired loans  delinquencies  collateral values  loss trends  and general economic conditions when assessing the adequacy of the allowance 
the allowance for loan losses was million or of loans and million or of loans at december  and  respectively 
the increased provision for loan losses in primarily resulted from higher charge offs of impaired loans and the impact of the higher charge offs on the loss trends that are used to calculate the allowance on the non impaired loans 
charge offs  net of recoveries  were million and million during and  respectively

non interest income consists principally of service charges and fees  mortgage banking income  investment services income  increase in cash value of life insurance  gain on sale of investments  and repossessed asset gains losses 
non interest income for was million compared to million in  an increase of 
service charges decreased in to million  primarily from a decrease in non sufficient funds fees  partially due to new regulations 
mortgage banking income  which represents fees earned from the origination and sale of mortgage loans  rose to million in from million in due to increased refinancing by borrowers and from fees of approximately million generated by a retail loan production office opened in july the mortgage division primarily originates loans through other banks and brokers and then sells the loans to investors 
other non interest income included million from the increase in cash value of life insurance in both and gains on the sale of investments of million in and million in and repossessed asset gains losses of million in and million in are also included in non interest income 
non interest expenses 
non interest expenses were million in compared to million in  an increase of million or 
salaries and employee benefits increased to 
table of contents million in from million in  primarily from expansion of our mortgage division including the addition of a retail loan production office  from strengthening of our credit administration  and from increased benefit costs 
the number of full time equivalent employees rose to at december  from at the end of impairment charges on repossessed assets rose to million in from million in due to declining real estate values on foreclosed properties 
repossessed asset expenses rose to million in from million in because our average investment in repossessed property  particularly those requiring extensive upkeep  increased in other non interest expense includes warranty expenses of million in and million in  related to providing for claims  both real and estimated  that might arise from borrower fraud or underwriting errors in our mortgage division 
three warranty claims totaling million have been incurred since establishment of the mortgage division in  and the current liability to fund future claims is million at december  income taxes 
income tax benefit was million  or of loss before income taxes in  compared to an income tax benefit of million  or of loss before income taxes in the higher tax benefit percentage in primarily resulted from a higher percentage of non taxable income from municipal securities and from the increase in cash value of life insurance 
financial condition 
total assets were million at december   a decrease of from total assets of million at december  all categories of assets decreased in except loans held for sale which increased due to increased lending in the mortgage division 
deposits and other borrowings declined as we adjusted our pricing to match our asset funding needs 
we periodically utilize wholesale deposit sources such as brokered deposits and deposits from other depository institutions on a limited basis to meet specific asset liability needs or to realize substantially lower funding costs 
we had approximately million and million in deposits from other depository institutions and million and million of brokered deposits at december  and december   respectively 
the increase in these sources in enabled us to extend our deposit maturities and lower our funding costs 
much of our asset decline in occurred in interest bearing deposits with banks  investments  and loans which together funded much of the million increase in loans held for sale resulting from record residential mortgage lending 
interest bearing deposits with banks of million primarily represent overnight deposits with the federal reserve and federal home loan bank and declined million in investment securities declined million 
loans held for investment decreased million  or  to million at december   primarily because of loan charge offs and repossessions of assets from non performing loans 
in past years  we experienced double digit growth in loans held for investment  but commercial and construction loan demand weakened in as a result of declining real estate prices and weak economic growth 
we believe our targeted marketing efforts  experienced lenders  local decision making  and emphasis on personal relationships and superior customer service have been key drivers of our loan growth in prior years  however  our emphasis on stronger risk management practices and a weak economy limited growth in approximately of our loans at december  were secured by some form of real estate 
at december  loans secured by one to four family residential properties comprised of our loan portfolio while nonresidential properties  construction loans and multifamily residential properties comprised  and of our loan portfolio  respectively 
another were commercial and industrial loans with the balance in consumer and other loans 
asset quality is a primary concern of our credit administration 
a thorough credit analysis is made of most loans before origination 
experienced lenders and a credit administrator review the loans structure including terms  rate  collateral and repayment sources in addition to adherence to our lending policy 
on an ongoing basis  a risk rating program and other credit administration tools are utilized to monitor loans

table of contents a certain degree of risk is inherent in the extension of credit 
we have established loan and credit policies designed to control both the types and amounts of risks assumed and to ultimately minimize credit losses 
such policies include limitations on loan to collateral values for various types of collateral  requirements for appraisals of certain real estate collateral  problem loan management practices and collection procedures  and non accrual and charge off guidelines 
loans secured by real estate mortgages comprised and of our loan portfolio at december  and  respectively 
residential real estate loans consist mainly of first and second mortgages on single family homes 
loan to value ratios for these loans are generally limited to for second mortgages and for first mortgages  unless private mortgage insurance is obtained 
nonresidential loans are secured by business and commercial properties with loan to value ratios generally limited to 
the repayment of both residential and nonresidential real estate loans is dependent primarily on the income and cash flows of the borrowers with the real estate serving as a secondary source of repayment 
real estate construction loans generally consist of financing of commercial real estate projects and some one to four family dwellings 
usually the loan to cost ratios are limited to  and permanent financing commitments are generally required prior to advancing loan proceeds 
commercial loans primarily represent loans to businesses and may be made on either a secured or unsecured basis 
commercial lending involves risk because repayment usually depends on the cash flows generated by a borrower s business  and the debt service capacity of a business can deteriorate because of downturns in national and local economic conditions 
to manage this risk  initial and continuing financial analysis of a borrower s financial information is generally required 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by direct charges to operating expense 
losses on loans are charged against the allowance in the period in which management has determined that such loans have become uncollectible  or in the case of non performing real estate loans  when updated appraisals indicate a loss in value 
recoveries of previously charged off loans are credited to the allowance 
our allowance for loan losses is composed of two parts  a specific portion related to impaired loans and a general section related to loans that are not impaired 
loans are impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that all amounts due according to the contractual terms will not be collected 
our impaired loans increased to million at december  from million at december  the specific portion of our allowance for loan losses  which relates to impaired loans  decreased to million at december  from million at december  the decline in the specific portion of our allowance relates to a change in the methodology of charging off real estate loans to appraised value when they become non performing which was implemented in due to this change  impaired loans were written off earlier in than in the change in charge off methodology is reflected in the amount which the unpaid principal balance on impaired loans exceeded the recorded investment which increased to million at december  from million at december  the general allowance  the difference between our allowance for loan losses and the specific portion of the allowance for loan losses  increased to million at december  from million at december  these allowances apply to performing loans and were determined by applying estimated loss ratios inherent in the loan portfolio  ranging from 
on certain consumer loans to on non secured consumer revolving loans  to categories of performing loans at each period end 
the increase in the general allowance in resulted from higher loan charge offs in and which represented the basis for computing the estimated loss ratios inherent in the loan portfolio 
prior to  a longer time frame had been used to calculate the loss ratios and included additional qualitative additions or deletions 
the general section also includes allowances for certain watch list loans which are not impaired but carry a higher 
table of contents degree of risk because of declining credit factors

when a loan is past due days as to interest or principal or there is serious doubt as to collectability  the accrual of interest is generally discontinued unless the estimated fair value of the collateral is sufficient to assure the collection of the principal balance and accrued interest 
a non accrual loan is not returned to accrual status unless principal and interest are current and the borrower has demonstrated the ability to continue making payments as agreed

construction and land development loans have been particularly affected by the economic downturn as demand for new housing or developed property has declined from prior years 
note below that our construction and land development loans had the highest level of impairment and specific loan loss allowances at december  as well as the highest net loan charge offs over the past two year period

the maturity distribution of time deposits of  or more at december  and is presented below 
such deposits may be more volatile and interest rate sensitive than other deposits 
the increase in was primarily due to the higher fdic deposit insurance limit of  which was extended to all time deposits in certificates of deposit in amounts of  or more at december  dollars in thousands remaining maturity three months or less over three through six months over six through twelve months over twelve months interest rate sensitivity 
interest rate sensitivity management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of re pricing assets compared to liabilities and is a part of asset liability management 
it is the objective of interest rate sensitivity management to generate stable growth in net interest income  and to control the risks associated with interest rate movements 
we measure interest rate risk by using simulation analysis 
prior to  simulation analysis indicated  in the absence of growth or changes in the mix of assets and liabilities  our net interest income generally increased when short term interest rates rose and declined when short term interest rates fell 
in late  we set our carolina bank prime at when the wall street prime declined to with the expectation that the carolina bank prime would not rise again until the wall street prime exceeded 
approximately of our loans held for investment  or million at december  adjust with the carolina bank prime 
we also implemented floors on 
table of contents a number of our variable rate loans which benefits our loan yields in a very low rate environment 
our net yield on average interest earning assets increased to in from in because deposit yields declined more than asset yields 
our simulation analysis indicates that our net interest margin will decline approximately  if interest rates immediately rise and will not begin to rise until interest rates rise between and 
the delay in adjusting our loans tied to the carolina bank prime or at floors is the major reason for the potential decline in net interest income as the wall street prime increases 
the table below reflects the balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at the earlier of their re pricing or maturity dates 
fixed rate loans are reflected at their contractual maturity date and variable rate loans are reflected when the loans may be re priced contractually  except variable loans that have reached their floors are treated as fixed rate loans 
investments in restricted and unrestricted stocks are excluded from the presentation 
interest bearing liabilities with no contractual maturity  such as interest bearing transaction accounts and savings deposits  are reflected in the earliest re pricing interval due to contractual arrangements which give the bank the opportunity to vary rates paid on these deposits within a thirty day or shorter period 
the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities illustrated in the following table would vary substantially if different assumptions were used or if actual experience differs from that indicated by such assumptions

carolina bank holdings  inc and carolina bank are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy standards 
under these standards  financial institutions are required to maintain minimum ratios of capital to risk weighted assets and average total assets 
carolina bank holdings  inc and carolina bank exceeded all minimum published capital requirements  and carolina bank met the requirements to be categorized as well capitalized at december  and included in the regulatory capital of carolina bank holdings  inc and subsidiary is million in junior subordinated debentures which has been primarily reinvested in the bank 
another million in subordinated debt securities issued by carolina bank in is included in the regulatory capital of the bank and the consolidated capital of carolina bank holdings  inc and subsidiary 
on january  we issued million in preferred stock to the united states treasury under the capital purchase program to help support future growth 
the preferred stock is included in the consolidated capital of carolina bank holdings  inc and subsidiary  and million of this capital  which was reinvested in the bank  is included in the bank s capital 
subsequent to december   carolina bank agreed to increase its tier capital to average assets to and to not pay any cash dividends or bonuses without the prior written consent of the supervisory authorities 
carolina bank holdings  inc also agreed subsequent to december  to obtain the written approval of the federal reserve before declaring or paying any dividend  common or preferred  or making any payments on trust preferred securities 
carolina bank holdings  inc plans to seek approval to pay dividends on its preferred stock and its trust preferred securities since more than adequate funds are available to make the payments  however  we can offer no assurances as to whether required approvals will be obtained 
no common stock dividends are anticipated in the near future 
inflation 
since our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature  our performance is more affected by changes in interest rates than by inflation 
interest rates generally increase as the rate of inflation increases  but the magnitude of the change in rates may not necessarily be the same 
while the effect of inflation on a financial institution is normally not as significant as is its influence on those businesses which have large investments in plant and inventories  it does have an effect 
during periods of high inflation  there are normally corresponding increases in the money supply  and financial institutions will normally experience above average growth in assets  loans and deposits 
also  general increases in the prices of goods and services will result in increased operating expenses
