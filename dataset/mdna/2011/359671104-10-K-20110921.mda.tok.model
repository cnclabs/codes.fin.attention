the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are an externally managed non diversified closed end management investment company formed in april  which has elected to be treated as a business development company under the our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments 
we are managed by full circle advisors  and full circle service company provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate 
on august   we priced our initial public offering of  shares of our common stock at the offering price of per share 
our shares are currently listed on the nasdaq capital market under the symbol full 
we were formed to continue and expand the business of full circle partners  lp and full circle fund  ltd 
collectively  the legacy funds  which were formed in and  respectively 
as part of this continuation and expansion  we invest primarily in asset based senior secured loans and  to a lesser extent  mezzanine loans and equity securities issued by smaller and lower middle market companies that operate in a diverse range of industries  with a specific focus on the media  communications and business services industries where we believe we have particular expertise 
in our lending activities  we focus primarily 
table of contents on portfolio companies with both i tangible and intangible assets available as collateral and security against our loan to help mitigate our risk of loss  and ii cash flow to cover debt service 
we believe this provides us with a more attractive risk adjusted return profile  with greater principal protection and likelihood of repayment 
immediately prior to the pricing of our initial public offering  we acquired a portfolio of investments the legacy portfolio from the legacy funds  which are managed by an affiliate of our investment adviser 
the investments included in the legacy portfolio had a collective fair value of approximately million as of june   as determined by our board of directors 
in connection with our acquisition of the legacy portfolio  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock and approximately million of senior unsecured notes the distribution notes to investors in the legacy funds the legacy investors  pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement the asset purchase agreement 
we also incurred approximately million of debt upon entry into a new secured revolving credit facility the credit facility with fcc  llc d b a first capital first capital in connection with the assumption of outstanding amounts under the legacy funds credit facilities the legacy credit facilities 
we refer to these transactions  collectively  as the full circle portfolio acquisition 
our investments generally range in size from million to million  however  we may make larger or smaller investments from time to time on an opportunistic basis 
we focus primarily on senior secured loans and stretch senior secured loans  also referred to as unitranche loans  which combine characteristics of traditional first lien senior secured loans and second lien or subordinated loans 
we believe that having a first lien  senior secured position provides us with greater control and security in the primary collateral of a borrower and helps to mitigate risk against loss of principal should a borrower default 
our stretch senior secured loans typically possess a greater advance rate against the borrower s assets and cash flow  and accordingly carry a higher interest rate and or greater equity participation  than traditional senior secured loans 
this stretch senior secured loan instrument can provide borrowers with a more efficient and desirable solution than a senior bank line combined with a separate second lien or mezzanine loan obtained from another source 
we also invest in mezzanine  subordinated or unsecured loans 
in addition  we may acquire equity or equity related interests from a borrower along with our debt investment 
we attempt to protect against risk of loss on our debt investments by securing our loans against a significant level of tangible or intangible assets of our borrowers  which may include accounts receivable and contracts for services  and obtaining a favorable loan to value ratio  and in many cases  securing other financial protections or credit enhancements  such as personal guarantees from the principals of our borrowers  make well agreements and other forms of collateral  rather than lending predominantly against anticipated cash flows of our borrowers 
we believe this allows us more options and greater likelihood of repayment from refinancing  asset sales of our borrowers and or amortization 
we generally seek to invest in smaller and lower middle market companies in areas that we believe have been historically under serviced  especially during and after the credit crisis 
these areas include industries that are outside the focus of mainstream institutions or investors due to required industry specific knowledge or are too small to attract interest from larger investment funds or other financial institutions 
because we believe there are fewer banks and specialty finance companies focused on lending to these smaller and lower middle market companies  we believe we can negotiate more favorable terms on our debt investments in these companies than those that would be available for debt investments in comparable larger  more mainstream borrowers 
such favorable terms may include higher debt yields  lower leverage levels  more significant covenant protection or greater equity grants than typical of other transactions 
we generally seek to avoid competing directly with other capital providers with respect to specific transactions in order to avoid the less favorable terms we believe are typically associated with such competitive bidding processes 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could materially differ from those estimates 
we have identified the following items as critical accounting policies 

table of contents basis of consolidation under the act rules  the regulations pursuant to article of regulation s x and the american institute of certified public accountants audit and accounting guide for investment companies  we are precluded from consolidating any entity other than another investment company or an operating company which provides substantially all of its services and benefits to us 
our financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of full circle west  inc and full circle icb  inc  our only wholly owned subsidiaries 
all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
valuation of investments in securities at fair value definition and hierarchy in accordance with gaap  fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ie  the exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
in determining fair value  full circle capital s board of directors uses various valuation approaches 
in accordance with gaap  a fair value hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the board of directors 
unobservable inputs reflect the board of directors assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
the fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the inputs as follows level valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access 
valuation adjustments and block discounts are not applied to level securities 
since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market  valuation of these securities does not entail a significant degree of judgment 
level valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable  either directly or indirectly 
level valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
the availability of valuation techniques and observable inputs can vary from security to security and is affected by a wide variety of factors including  the type of security  whether the security is new and not yet established in the marketplace  and other characteristics particular to the transaction 
to the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market  the determination of fair value requires more judgment 
those estimated values do not necessarily represent the amounts that may be ultimately realized due to the occurrence of future circumstances that cannot be reasonably determined 
because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation  those estimated values may be materially higher or lower than the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed 
accordingly  the degree of judgment exercised by the board of directors in determining fair value is greatest for securities categorized in level in certain cases  the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy 
in such cases  for disclosure purposes  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls  is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
fair value is a market based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity specific measure 
therefore  even when market assumptions are not readily available  the company s own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
the company uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date  including periods of market dislocation 
in periods of market dislocation  the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many securities 
this condition could cause a security to be reclassified to a lower level within the fair value hierarchy 

table of contents valuation techniques senior and subordinated secured loans our portfolio consists primarily of private debt instruments level debt 
the company considers its level debt to be performing if the borrower is not in default  the borrower is remitting payments in a timely manner  the loan is in covenant compliance or is otherwise not deemed to be impaired 
in determining the fair value of the performing level debt  the company s board of directors considers fluctuations in current interest rates  the trends in yields of debt instruments with similar credit ratings  financial condition of the borrower  economic conditions and other relevant factors  both qualitative and quantitative 
in the event that a level debt instrument is not performing  as defined above  the company s board of directors will evaluate the value of the collateral utilizing the same framework described above for a performing loan to determine the value of the level debt instrument 
this evaluation will be updated no less than quarterly for level debt instruments  and more frequently for time periods where there are significant changes in the investor base or significant changes in the perceived value of the underlying collateral 
the collateral value will be analyzed on an ongoing basis using internal metrics  appraisals  third party valuation agents and other data as may be acquired and analyzed by management and the company s board of directors 
investments in private companies the company s board of directors determines the fair value of its investments in private companies by incorporating valuations that consider the evaluation of financing and sale transactions with third parties  expected cash flows and market based information  including comparable transactions  and performance multiples  among other factors  including third party valuation agents 
these nonpublic investments are included in level of the fair value hierarchy 
warrants the company s board of directors ascribes value to warrants based on fair value analyses that can include discounted cash flow analyses  option pricing models  comparable analyses and other techniques as deemed appropriate 
fair value the company s assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis subject to the disclosure requirements of asc topic at june  were as follows

use of estimates the preparation of the financial statements of full circle capital in conformity with gaap requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts disclosed in the financial statements of full circle capital 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  fair value measurements topic  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss asu 
asu results in common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of asu is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued asu  receivables topic a creditor s determination of whether a restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring asu 
asu clarifies which loan modifications constitute troubled debt restructurings 
it is intended to assist creditors in determining whether a modification of the terms of a receivable meets the criteria to be considered a troubled debt restructuring  both for purposes of recording an impairment loss and for disclosure of troubled debt restructurings 
in evaluating whether a restructuring constitutes a troubled debt restructuring  a creditor must separately conclude that both of the following exist a the restructuring constitutes a concession  and b the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties 
asu provides guidance to clarify whether the creditor has granted a concession and whether a debtor is experiencing financial difficulties 
the new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after june   and applies retrospectively to restructurings occurring on or after the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption 
the adoption of asu is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued asu no 
fair value measurements and disclosures related to fair value measurements and disclosures topic  improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this update provides amendments to subtopic that requires new disclosures for transfers in and out of levels and  reporting gross activity in level fair value measurements  and clarifications to the level of detail of existing disclosures 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   with the exception of reporting gross activity in level fair value measurements which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect the adoption of asu to have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
current market conditions and market opportunity we believe that the current credit environment provides favorable opportunities to achieve attractive risk adjusted returns on the types of senior secured loans and other investments we may target 
in particular  we believe that  despite an overall fall off in loan demand due to the depressed economic conditions  demand for financing from smaller to lower middle market companies is largely outpacing the availability of lenders 
table of contents that have traditionally served this market 
we believe that bank consolidations  the failure of a number of alternative lending vehicles due to poor underwriting practices and an overall tightening of underwriting standards has significantly reduced the number and activity level of potential lenders 
we believe there has long been a combination of demand for capital and an underserved market for capital addressing smaller and lower middle market borrowers 
we believe there is robust demand for continued growth capital as well as demand from very significant refinancing requirements of many borrowers as debt facilities come due  given the lack of willing and qualified capital providers 
we believe these market conditions have been further exacerbated in the current environment due to larger lenders exiting this market to focus on larger investment opportunities which are more appropriate for their operating cost structures  the elimination of many specialized lenders from the market due to lack of capital as a result of  for instance  the closing off of the securitization market or their own poor performance  and the need for certain capital providers to reduce lending activities due to their reduced access to capital and the overall deleveraging of the financial market 
with the decreased availability of debt capital for smaller to lower middle market borrowers  combined with the significant demand for refinancing  we believe there are increased lending opportunities for us 
as always  we remain cautious in selecting new investment opportunities  and will only deploy capital in deals which are consistent with our disciplined philosophy of pursuing superior risk adjusted returns 
portfolio composition and investment activity our portfolio of investments consists primarily of senior secured loans and  to a lesser extent  mezzanine loans and equity securities issued by smaller and lower middle market companies 
our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments 
the primary investment activity for the year ended june  was the purchase of the legacy portfolio on august  which coincided with the commencement of operations on that date 
the investments included in the legacy portfolio had a collective fair value of approximately million as of june   as determined by our board of directors 
accordingly  the results for the year ended june  relating to portfolio activity primarily cover ten months of operations commencing on august  during the year ended june   the company made investments in the following companies the company entered into a million  multi draw loan facility with us path labs  llc on march  the company entered into a million  multi draw loan facility  comprised of a term a loan and a term b loan  with csl operating  llc on may  the company entered into a million loan facility  comprised of a term a loan and a term b loan  with background images  inc on june  during the year ended june   the company had the following investments fully repay the company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
as of june   three debt investments in our portfolio were at a fixed rate  and the remaining seventeen debt investments were at variable rates  representing approximately million and million in principal debt  respectively 
the majority of our floating rate debt instruments are currently at their floor interest rate 
the variable rates are based upon the prime rate or libor 
to illustrate the potential impact of a change in the underlying interest rate on our net investment income  we have assumed a increase in the underlying prime rate or libor  and no other change in our portfolio as of june  we have also assumed million of outstanding borrowings  with no outstanding borrowings having a floating rate based upon libor 
under this analysis  net investment income would increase by approximately million annually 
if we had instead assumed a decrease in the underlying prime rate or libor  net investment income would decrease correspondingly by approximately million annually 
although management believes that this analysis is indicative of our existing interest rate sensitivity at june   it does not adjust for changes in the credit quality  size and composition of our portfolio  and other business developments  including borrowing under a credit facility  that could affect the net increase in net assets resulting from operations 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the results under this hypothetical analysis 
we may in the future hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures  options and forward contracts 
while hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates  they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the investments in our portfolio with fixed interest rates
