forward looking statements include statements regarding the intent  belief or current expectations of our management team  as well as the assumptions on which such statements are based 
any forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements to reflect changed assumptions  the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results over time 
important factors currently known to management that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward looking statements include risks and uncertainties associated with economic conditions in the commercial interiors industry as well as the risks and uncertainties discussed in item a  risk factors 

table of contents item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following factors  in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form k and the other documents incorporated herein by reference  before deciding whether to purchase or sell our common stock 
any or all of the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
general business risks the ongoing worldwide financial and credit crisis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the ongoing worldwide financial and credit crisis has reduced the availability of liquidity and credit to fund the continuation and expansion of many business operations worldwide 
this shortage of liquidity and credit  combined with recent substantial losses in worldwide equity markets  could lead to an extended worldwide economic recession and result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
specifically  the limited availability of credit and liquidity adversely affects the ability of customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations 
consequently  customers may defer  delay or cancel renovation and construction projects where our carpet is used  resulting in decreased orders and sales for us  and they also may not be able to pay us for those products and services we already have provided to them 
for the same reasons  suppliers may not be able to produce and deliver raw materials and other goods and services that we have ordered from them  thus disrupting our own manufacturing operations 
in addition  our ability to obtain funding from capital markets may be severely restricted at a time when we would like  or need  to access those markets 
this inability to obtain that funding could prevent us from pursuing important strategic growth plans  from reacting to changing economic and business conditions  and from refinancing existing debt which in turn could lead to a default on our debt 
the financial and credit crisis also could have an impact on the lenders under our credit facilities  causing them to fail to meet their obligations to provide us with loans and letters of credit  which are important sources of liquidity for us 
our domestic revolving credit facility matures in december we cannot assure you that we will be able to renegotiate or refinance this debt on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  especially given the ongoing worldwide financial and credit crisis 
sales of our principal products have been and may continue to be affected by adverse economic cycles in the renovation and construction of commercial and institutional buildings 
sales of our principal products are related to the renovation and construction of commercial and institutional buildings 
this activity is cyclical and has been affected by the strength of a country s or region s general economy  prevailing interest rates and other factors that lead to cost control measures by businesses and other users of commercial or institutional space 
the effects of cyclicality upon the corporate office segment tend to be more pronounced than the effects upon the institutional segment 
historically  we have generated more sales in the corporate office segment than in any other market 
the effects of cyclicality upon the new construction segment of the market also tend to be more pronounced than the effects upon the renovation segment 
these effects may recur and could be more pronounced if the current global economic conditions do not improve or are further weakened 
we compete with a large number of manufacturers in the highly competitive commercial floorcovering products market  and some of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do 
the commercial floorcovering industry is highly competitive 
globally  we compete for sales of floorcovering products with other carpet manufacturers and manufacturers of other types of floorcovering 
although the industry has experienced significant consolidation  a large number of manufacturers remain in the industry 
some of our competitors  including a number of large diversified domestic and foreign companies who manufacture modular carpet as one segment of their business  have greater financial resources than we do 

table of contents our success depends significantly upon the efforts  abilities and continued service of our senior management executives and our principal design consultant  and our loss of any of them could affect us adversely 
we believe that our success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management executives 
in addition  we rely significantly on the leadership that david oakey of david oakey designs provides to our internal design staff 
specifically  david oakey designs provides product design production engineering services to us under an exclusive consulting contract that contains non competition covenants 
our current agreement with david oakey designs extends to april the loss of any of these key persons could have an adverse impact on our business because each has a great deal of knowledge  training and experience in the carpet industry particularly in the areas of sales  marketing  operations  product design and management and could not easily or quickly be replaced 
our substantial international operations are subject to various political  economic and other uncertainties that could adversely affect our business results  including by restrictive taxation or other government regulation and by foreign currency fluctuations 
we have substantial international operations 
in  approximately half of our net sales and a significant portion of our production were outside the united states  primarily in europe and asia pacific 
our corporate strategy includes the expansion and growth of our international business on a worldwide basis 
as a result  our operations are subject to various political  economic and other uncertainties  including risks of restrictive taxation policies  changing political conditions and governmental regulations 
we also make a substantial portion of our net sales in currencies other than us dollars approximately half of net sales  which subjects us to the risks inherent in currency translations 
the scope and volume of our global operations make it impossible to eliminate completely all foreign currency translation risks as an influence on our financial results 
large increases in the cost of petroleum based raw materials could adversely affect us if we are unable to pass these cost increases through to our customers 
petroleum based products comprise the predominant portion of the cost of raw materials that we use in manufacturing 
while we attempt to match cost increases with corresponding price increases  continued volatility in the cost of petroleum based raw materials could adversely affect our financial results if we are unable to pass through such price increases to our customers 
unanticipated termination or interruption of any of our arrangements with our primary third party suppliers of synthetic fiber could have a material adverse effect on us 
the unanticipated termination or interruption of any of our supply arrangements with our current suppliers of synthetic fiber nylon  which typically are not pursuant to long term agreements  could have a material adverse effect on us because we do not have the capability to manufacture our own fiber for use in our carpet products 
if any of our supply arrangements with our primary suppliers of synthetic fiber is terminated or interrupted  we likely would incur increased manufacturing costs and experience delays in our manufacturing process thus resulting in decreased sales and profitability associated with shifting more of our synthetic fiber purchasing to another synthetic fiber supplier 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness  which could have important negative consequences to us 
our significant indebtedness could have important negative consequences to us  including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to such indebtedness  increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions or other growth initiatives  and other general corporate requirements  
table of contents requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to interest and principal payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions or other growth initiatives  and other general corporate requirements  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors  and limiting our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness as it matures 
as a consequence of our level of indebtedness  a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to debt service requirements 
in addition  the terms of our primary revolving credit facility in the us and the indenture governing our senior notes due limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments or investments in certain situations  consummate certain asset sales  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  create liens  merge or consolidate with any other person  or sell  assign  transfer  lease  convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets 
they also require us to comply with certain other reporting  affirmative and negative covenants and  at times  meet certain financial tests 
if we fail to satisfy these tests or comply with these covenants  a default may occur  in which case the lenders could accelerate the debt as well as any other debt to which cross acceleration or cross default provisions apply 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to renegotiate  refinance or otherwise obtain the necessary funds to satisfy these obligations 
the market price of our common stock has been volatile and the value of your investment may decline 
the market price of our class a common stock has been volatile in the past and may continue to be volatile going forward 
such volatility may cause precipitous drops in the price of our class a common stock on the nasdaq global select market and may cause your investment in our common stock to lose significant value 
as a general matter  market price volatility has had a significant effect on the market values of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance 
we thus cannot predict the market price for our common stock going forward 
our earnings in a future period could be adversely affected by non cash adjustments to goodwill  if a future test of goodwill assets indicates a material impairment of those assets 
as prescribed by accounting standards governing goodwill and other intangible assets  we undertake an annual review of the goodwill asset balance reflected in our financial statements 
our review is conducted during the fourth quarter of the year  unless there has been a triggering event prescribed by applicable accounting rules that warrants an earlier interim testing for possible goodwill impairment 
in the past  we have had non cash adjustments for goodwill impairment as a result of such testings million in  million in  and million in 
a future goodwill impairment test may result in a future non cash adjustment  which could adversely affect our earnings for any such future period

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general our revenues are derived from sales of floorcovering products  primarily modular and broadloom carpet 
our business  as well as the commercial interiors industry in general  is cyclical in nature and is impacted by economic conditions and trends that affect the markets for commercial and institutional business space 
the commercial interiors industry  including the market for floorcovering products  is largely driven by reinvestment by corporations into their existing businesses in the form of new fixtures and furnishings for their workplaces 
in significant part  the timing and amount of such reinvestments are impacted by the profitability of those corporations 
as a result  macroeconomic factors such as employment rates  office vacancy rates  capital spending  productivity and efficiency gains that impact corporate profitability in general  also affect our business 
during the past several years  we have successfully focused more of our marketing and sales efforts on non corporate office segments to reduce somewhat our exposure to economic cycles that affect the corporate office market segment more adversely  as well as to capture additional market share 
our mix of corporate office versus non corporate office modular carpet sales in the americas has shifted over the past several years to and  respectively  for compared with and  respectively  in company wide  our mix of corporate office versus non corporate office sales was and  respectively  in we expect a further shift in the future as we continue to implement our market diversification strategy 
from through the first half of  the commercial interiors industry experienced growth at a gradual pace  which led to improved sales and operating profitability for us during that period 
in the fourth quarter of  and particularly in november and december  the worldwide financial and credit crisis caused many corporations  governments and other organizations to delay or curtail spending on renovation and construction projects where our carpet is used 
this downturn  which continued throughout  negatively impacted our performance and led to the goodwill impairment and restructuring charges  discussed below  that we incurred in the fourth quarter of and the first half of demand levels substantially recovered in during  we had net sales of million  compared with million in operating income for was million  compared with operating income of million in income from continuing operations in was million  or per diluted share  compared with income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  in net income attributable to interface  inc was million  or per diluted share  in  compared with net income attributable to interface  inc of million  or per diluted share  in

included in our results for are million of restructuring charges and million of bond retirement expenses related to the tender offer we conducted for our senior notes  each of which is discussed below 
in addition  our results for include income of million related to settlements of patent litigation  which is a net amount after deducting all legal fees and related expenses 
we received million of gross proceeds from these settlements 
included in our results for are a goodwill impairment charge of million  restructuring charges of million  and a repatriation charge of million  each of which is discussed below 
restructuring charges restructuring plan in the first quarter of  we adopted a restructuring plan primarily related to workforce reduction in our european modular carpet operations 
this reduction was in response to the continued challenging economic climate in that region 
smaller amounts were incurred in connection with restructuring activities in the americas 
a total of approximately employees were affected by this restructuring plan 
in connection with this plan  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million 
substantially all of this charge involves cash expenditures  primarily severance expenses 
it is anticipated that this restructuring plan will generate annual savings of approximately million 
actions and expenses related to this plan were substantially completed in the first quarter of restructuring plan in the first quarter of  we adopted a restructuring plan  primarily comprised of a further reduction in our worldwide employee base by a total of approximately employees and continuing actions taken to better align fixed costs with demand for our products on a global level 
in connection with the plan  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million  comprised of million of employee severance expense and million of other exit costs primarily costs to exit the canadian manufacturing facilities  lease exit costs and other costs 
approximately million of the restructuring charge involves cash expenditures  primarily severance expense 
in the second quarter of  we recorded an additional million restructuring charge as a continuation of this plan 
the charge in the second quarter of is due to approximately additional employee reductions  and relates entirely to employee severance expense 
restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of  we committed to a restructuring plan intended to reduce costs across our worldwide operations  and more closely align our operations with demand levels 
the reduction of the demand levels was primarily a result of the worldwide recession and the associated delays and reductions in the number of construction projects where our carpet products are used 
the plan primarily consisted of ceasing manufacturing operations at our facility in belleville  canada  and reducing our worldwide employee base by a total of approximately employees in the areas of manufacturing  sales and administration 
in connection with the restructuring plan  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of of million 
we record our restructuring accruals under the provisions of the applicable accounting standards 
the restructuring charge was comprised of employee severance expense of million  impairment of assets of million  and other exit costs of million primarily related to lease exit costs and other closure activities 
approximately million of the restructuring charge involved cash expenditures  primarily severance expense 
actions and expenses related to this plan were substantially completed in the first quarter of senior notes on december   we completed a private offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the senior notes 
interest on the senior notes is payable semi 
table of contents annually on june and december beginning june  we used the net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes plus cash on hand in connection with the repurchase of approximately million aggregate principal amount of our senior secured notes and approximately million aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes  pursuant to a tender offer we conducted in we incurred million of bond retirement expenses in connection with these repurchases pursuant to the tender offer 
senior secured notes on june   we completed a private offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due the senior secured notes 
interest on the senior secured notes is payable semi annually on may and november the first interest payment was on november  
the senior secured notes are guaranteed  jointly and severally  on a senior secured basis by certain of our domestic subsidiaries 
the senior secured notes are secured by a second priority lien on substantially all of our and certain of our domestic subsidiaries assets that secure our domestic revolving credit facility discussed below on a first priority basis 
the senior secured notes were sold at a price of of their face value  resulting in million of gross proceeds 
the million original issue discount is being amortized over the life of the notes through interest expense  although substantially all of this discount was accelerated and charged in as a result of our repurchases in the tender offer we conducted for these notes in connection with the issuance of our senior notes 
after deducting the initial purchasers discount and other fees and expenses associated with the sale  net proceeds from the issuance of the senior secured notes were million 
we used million of those net proceeds to repurchase million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due the senior notes pursuant to a tender offer we conducted in included in the million used to repurchase the million aggregate principal amount of senior notes were a purchase price premium of million and accrued interest of million 
we incurred million of bond retirement expenses in connection with these repurchases 
the remaining million of the net proceeds was used to repay a portion of the million of senior notes that remained outstanding following the tender offer 
the balance of the senior notes was then repaid at maturity on february  partial redemption of senior subordinated notes due in the first quarter of  we redeemed million aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes the senior subordinated notes at a price equal to of the face value of the notes  plus accrued interest to the redemption date 
we incurred million of bond retirement expenses in connection with these repurchases 
goodwill impairment write down during the fourth quarters of  and  we performed the annual goodwill impairment test required by accounting standards 
we perform this test at the reporting unit level  which is one level below the segment level for the modular carpet segment and at the level of the bentley prince street segment 
in effecting the impairment testing  we prepared valuations of reporting units on both a market comparable methodology and an income methodology in accordance with the applicable standards  and those valuations were compared with the respective book values of the reporting units to determine whether any goodwill impairment existed 
in preparing the valuations  past  present and future expectations of performance were considered 
the results of the tests indicated no impairment of goodwill in or in the fourth quarter of  a goodwill impairment of million related to our bentley prince street reporting unit was identified due largely to the following factors there was a significant decline in bentley prince street s performance  primarily in the last three months of this decline also was reflected in the forward projections of bentley prince street s budgeting process 
the projections showed a decline in both sales and operating income over bentley 
table of contents prince street s three year budgeting process 
these declines impacted the value of the business from an income valuation approach 
the declines in projections were primarily related to the global economic crisis and its impact on the broadloom carpet market 
there was an increase in the discount rate used to create the present value of future expected cash flows 
this increase from approximately to was more reflective of our market capitalization and risk premiums on a reporting unit level  which impacted the value of the business using an income valuation approach 
there was a decrease in the market multiple factors used for a market valuation approach 
this decrease was reflective of the general market conditions regarding current market activities and market valuation guidelines 
repatriation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a tax charge of approximately million for the anticipated future repatriation of approximately million of earnings from our canadian and european subsidiaries 
we anticipated repatriating most of these earnings in to accumulate cash in the united states in light of the then pending maturity of our senior notes 
as a result  we determined that those earnings were no longer indefinitely reinvested outside of the us and recorded the appropriate charge  in accordance with the provisions of applicable accounting standards 
for additional information on this tax charge  see the note entitled taxes on income in item of this report 
discontinued operations in  we sold our fabrics group business segment to a third party 
following working capital and other adjustments provided for in the agreement  we received million in cash at the closing of the transaction 
we initially recognized a million receivable related to additional purchase price under the sale agreement pursuant to an earn out arrangement focused on the performance of that business segment  as owned and operated by the purchaser  during the month period following the closing 
however  in  we determined that the receipt of this deferred amount was less than probable and therefore reserved for the full amount of this deferred purchase price 
as discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report  in the first quarter of  we recorded charges for impairment of goodwill of million and impairment of other intangible assets of million related to the fabrics group business segment 
in addition  as a result of the agreed upon purchase price for the segment  we recorded an additional impairment of assets of million in the second quarter of in accordance with applicable accounting standards  we have reported the results of operations for the former fabrics group business segment for all periods reflected herein  as discontinued operations 
consequently  our discussion of revenues or sales  taxes and other results of operations except for net income or loss amounts  including percentages derived from or based on such amounts  excludes these discontinued operations unless we indicate otherwise 
our discontinued operations had no net sales in  and loss from operations of these businesses  inclusive of goodwill impairments and other asset impairments as well as costs to sell these businesses  net of tax  was million  million and million in  and  respectively these results are included in our consolidated statements of operations as part of the loss from discontinued operations  net of tax 
for additional information on discontinued operations  see the notes entitled discontinued operations  sale of fabrics business and taxes on income in item of this report 

table of contents analysis of results of operations the following discussion and analyses reflect the factors and trends discussed in the preceding sections 
our net sales that were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar were approximately in  in  and in because we have such substantial international operations  we are impacted  from time to time  by international developments that affect foreign currency transactions 
for example  the performance of the euro against the us dollar  for purposes of the translation of european revenues into us dollars  favorably affected our reported results during  when the euro was strengthening relative to the us dollar 
during the years and  the dollar strengthened versus the euro  having the opposite effect on our reported results 
the following table presents the amount in us dollars by which the exchange rates for converting euros into us dollars have affected our net sales and operating income during the past three years in millions net sales operating income the following table presents  as a percentage of net sales  certain items included in our consolidated statements of operations during the past three years fiscal year net sales cost of sales gross profit on sales selling  general and administrative expenses impairment of goodwill restructuring charge income from litigation settlements operating income interest other expense bond retirement expenses income from continuing operations before tax income tax expense income loss from continuing operations discontinued operations  net of tax net income loss net income loss attributable to interface  inc below we provide information regarding net sales for each of our two operating segments  and analyze those results for each of the last three fiscal years 
fiscal year was a week period  while fiscal years and were week periods 
the weeks in versus the weeks in and are a factor in certain of the comparisons reflected below 
net sales by business segment we currently classify our businesses into the following two operating segments for reporting purposes modular carpet segment  which includes our interfaceflor  heuga and flor modular carpet businesses  and also includes our intersept antimicrobial chemical sales and licensing program  and 
table of contents bentley prince street segment  which includes our bentley prince street broadloom  modular carpet and area rug businesses 
net sales by operating segment were as follows during the past three years percentage change fiscal year compared compared net sales by segment with with in thousands modular carpet bentley prince street total modular carpet segment 
for  net sales for the modular carpet segment increased million versus the weighted average selling price per square yard in showed a slight increase approximately versus on a geographic basis  we experienced increases in net sales in the americas  europe  and asia pacific up  and  respectively in versus the sales increase in europe in local currency was 
these increases are primarily attributable to the improving economic climates in those regions 
sales growth in the americas is due to the continued recovery in the corporate office market segment up as well the education up  hospitality up  residential up and governmental up market segments 
only one market segment retail  down showed a decline in the americas 
the sales increase in europe was led by the corporate office up in us dollars and in local currency  retail up in us dollars and in local currency and education up in us dollars and in local currency market segments 
these increases were offset somewhat by declines in the residential down in us dollars and in local currency and healthcare down in us dollars and in local currency market segments 
the asia pacific region saw sales increase across all market segments  with corporate office up and education up over showing the most significant increases 
for  net sales for the modular carpet segment decreased million versus this decline was primarily attributable to the reduced order activity for renovation and construction projects as a result of the worldwide financial and credit crisis 
the weighted average selling price per square yard in was down compared with as a result of the enhanced price sensitivity of our customers due to the financial and credit crisis 
on a geographic basis  our net sales in the americas were down  primarily driven by the decline in the corporate office segment decrease as well as decreases in the hospitality decrease and healthcare decrease segments 
these decreases were somewhat mitigated  however  by increases in the institutional which includes education and government facilities  a increase and retail increase segments 
net sales in europe were down in local currency and as reported in us dollars  with this difference due to the strengthening of the us dollar versus the euro and british pound sterling on a year over year basis 
the sales decline in europe occurred across most markets and particularly the corporate office market  down in local currency  with the exception of the healthcare and government markets which saw increases in local currency of and  respectively 
net sales in asia pacific were down  due primarily to the decrease in the corporate office segment decrease  which comprises the majority of that division s sales 
this decrease was somewhat mitigated  however  by increases in the education increase and hospitality increase segments 
bentley prince street segment 
for  net sales in our bentley prince street segment increased million versus the increase was due to the strength of the corporate office market segment up as well as an increase in sales into the government market segment up 
these increases were somewhat offset by decreases in the healthcare down  hospitality down  residential down and education down market segments 
the weighted average selling price per square yard in showed an improvement of approximately due to both the improving economic climate as well as a shift towards higher priced modular carpet sold at bentley prince street

table of contents as a result of the worldwide financial and credit crisis  as well as the general market movement away from broadloom carpet and toward carpet tile 
this decrease was somewhat offset by a increase in weighted average selling price per square yard  a result of the increase in modular carpet as a percentage of its sales modular carpet represented of its sales in versus in 
with the exception of a increase in the government segment  the sales decrease occurred across all markets  with the most significant declines being in the corporate decrease  hospitality decrease and residential decrease segments 
cost and expenses company consolidated 
the following table presents  on a consolidated basis for our operations  our overall cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses during the past three years percentage change fiscal year compared compared cost and expenses with with in thousands cost of sales selling  general and administrative expenses total for  our cost of sales increased million versus fluctuations in currency exchange rates accounted for approximately million of the increase 
the primary components of the million increase in cost of sales were increases in raw material costs approximately million and labor costs approximately million associated with higher production and sales volumes during versus our raw material prices in were approximately higher than raw material prices in as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales decreased to for  versus in the percentage decrease was primarily due to improved manufacturing efficiencies in both our modular carpet and bentley prince street business segments 
the improved manufacturing efficiencies are largely a result of the increase in sales volume  coupled with the full realization of our restructuring plans implemented during early for  our costs of sales decreased million versus fluctuations in currency exchange rates accounted for approximately million of this decrease 
the primary components of the million decrease in costs of sales were reductions in raw materials costs million and labor costs million associated with decreased production levels in  largely a result of the worldwide financial and credit crisis that began in the fourth quarter of our raw material prices in were approximately lower than raw material prices in as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales increased to during versus during this percentage increase was due to under absorption of fixed overhead costs associated with the lower production volumes 
for  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased million versus fluctuations in currency exchange rates accounted for approximately million of the increase 
the primary components of the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses were an million increase in incentive compensation due to the attainment of performance goals in  a million increase in marketing expenses  particularly in our modular carpet segment where we continue to invest in our end market diversification strategy as well as corporate office segment marketing programs  and an million increase in selling expenses particularly in our modular carpet operations commensurate with the increase in sales volume 
these increases were somewhat mitigated  however  by a decrease of approximately million in general administrative expenses across our business  a direct result of the full year benefit of restructuring plans implemented in despite the overall increases  due to increased sales volume  as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to for  versus for 
table of contents for  our selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million versus fluctuations in currency exchange rates accounted for approximately million of this decrease 
the primary components of the million decrease were a million decrease in selling costs associated with the lower sales volume in  a million decrease in marketing expenses as programs were cut or reduced in to better match anticipated demand  and a million decrease in general administrative costs  directly related to our and restructuring plans discussed above 
due to our lower sales volume in  as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  versus in cost and expenses by segment 
the following table presents the combined cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses for each of our operating segments during the past three years cost of sales and selling  general fiscal year percentage change and administrative expenses compared compared combined with with in thousands modular carpet bentley prince street corporate expenses total interest and other expense for  interest expense decreased by million versus  primarily due to the redemption of million of our senior subordinated notes in the first quarter of the savings from the redemption were somewhat offset by the higher interest rate paid on our senior secured notes  which were outstanding during the full year of versus only seven months outstanding in approximately million of these senior secured notes were repurchased in december 
for  interest expense increased by million versus  primarily due to the issuance of our million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes in june of these notes  which were issued at a discount to their face value  carry a higher principal balance and rate of interest than the million aggregate principal amount of senior notes that were repaid with the issuance net proceeds 
other factors in the increase were the amortization of deferred debt costs related to the senior secured notes  and the fees we pay for our lines of credit 
tax our effective tax rate in was  compared with an effective rate of in this decrease in effective rate is primarily attributable to an effective foreign tax rate that is lower than the federal statutory rate coupled with a increase of foreign earnings from to  a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits related to a settlement of the canadian tax authorities transfer pricing reassessment for tax years and  and an increase in state tax benefits due to greater state net operating losses realized in compared to the decrease in effective rate was partially offset by an increase in valuation allowances related to state net operating loss carryforwards and an increase in the us tax effects attributable to foreign operations related to subpart f income 
for additional information on taxes and a reconciliation of effective tax rates to statutory tax rates  see the note entitled taxes on income in item of this report 
our effective tax rate in was  compared with an effective rate of in this difference in effective rate was primarily attributable to a non deductible goodwill impairment charge in related to our bentley prince street business  a provision for taxes related to undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the us  and an increase in non deductible business expenses related to a decrease in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies associated with the funding of our nonqualified savings plans and salary continuation

liquidity and capital resources general in our business  we require cash and other liquid assets primarily to purchase raw materials and to pay other manufacturing costs  in addition to funding normal course selling  general and administrative expenses  anticipated capital expenditures  interest expense and potential special projects 
we generate our cash and other liquidity requirements primarily from our operations and from borrowings or letters of credit under our domestic revolving credit facility with a banking syndicate 
we believe that we will be able to continue to enhance the generation of free cash flow through the following initiatives improving our inventory turns by continuing to implement a made to order model throughout our organization  reducing our average days sales outstanding through improved credit and collection practices  and limiting the amount of our capital expenditures generally to those projects that have a short term payback period 
historically  we use more cash in the first half of the fiscal year  as we fund insurance premiums  tax payments  incentive compensation and inventory build up in preparation for the holiday vacation season of our international operations 
in addition  we have a high contribution margin business with low capital expenditure requirements 
contribution margin represents variable gross profit margin less the variable component of selling  general and administrative expenses  and for us is an indicator of profit on incremental sales after the fixed components of cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expenses have been recovered 
while contribution margin should not be construed as a substitute for gross margin  which is determined in accordance with gaap  it is included herein to provide additional information with respect to our potential for profitability 
in addition  we believe that investors find contribution margin to be a useful tool for measuring our profitability on an operating basis 
our ability to generate cash from operating activities is somewhat uncertain because we are subject to  and in the past have experienced  fluctuations in our level of net sales 
in this regard  the worldwide financial and credit crisis that developed in the latter part of resulted in a reduction in our net sales  as customers delayed or reduced the number of renovation and construction projects where our carpet products are used 
demand levels substantially recovered in at january   we had million in cash 
at that date  we had no borrowings and million in letters of credit outstanding under our domestic revolving credit facility  and no borrowings outstanding under our european credit facility 
as of january   we could have incurred million of additional borrowings under our domestic revolving credit facility and million approximately million of additional borrowings under our european credit facility 
in addition  we could have incurred the equivalent of million of borrowings under our other credit facilities in place at other non us subsidiaries 
we have approximately million in contractual cash obligations due by the end of fiscal year  which includes  among other things  pension cash contributions  interest payments on our debt and capital expenditure commitments 
based on current interest rate and debt levels  we expect our aggregate interest expense for to be between million and million 
we estimate aggregate capital expenditures in to be between million and million  although we are not committed to these amounts 
on december   we completed a private offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the senior notes 
interest on the senior notes is payable semi annually on june and december beginning june  we used the net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes plus cash on hand in connection with the repurchase of approximately million 
table of contents aggregate principal amount of our senior secured notes and approximately million aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinated notes  pursuant to a tender offer we conducted 
in june  we issued million aggregate principal amount of our senior secured notes 
after deducting the initial purchasers discount and other fees and expenses associated with the sale  net proceeds were million 
we used million of those net proceeds to repurchase million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes pursuant to a tender offer we conducted 
included in the million used to repurchase the million aggregate principal amount of senior notes were a purchase price premium of million and accrued interest of million 
the remaining million of the net proceeds was used to repay a portion of the million of senior notes that remained outstanding following the tender offer 
the balance of the senior notes was then repaid at maturity on february  it is important for you to consider that we have a significant amount of indebtedness 
our domestic revolving credit facility matures in december  our outstanding million of senior secured notes mature in november  our outstanding million of senior subordinated notes mature in february  and our outstanding million of senior notes mature in we cannot assure you that we will be able to renegotiate or refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms  or at all

analysis of cash flows our primary sources of cash during were million of gross proceeds from the issuance of our senior notes  million due to an increase of accounts payable and accrued expenses  and million from the exercise of employee stock options 
our primary uses of cash during were million used to repurchase a portion of our senior secured notes and senior subordinated notes  million for premiums paid in connection with the repurchase of these senior and senior subordinated notes  million for capital expenditures  and million due to an increase in inventory 
our primary sources of cash during were million from the issuance of our million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes  million from a reduction of accounts receivable  million from a reduction of inventory  and million from settlements of litigation 
the primary uses of cash during were million used to repurchase a portion of our senior notes  million as a reduction in accounts payable and accruals  million for capital expenditures  million for debt issuance costs in connection with the senior secured notes  and million for premiums paid in connection with the repurchase of our senior notes 
our primary sources of cash during were million from cash received as a reduction of accounts receivable  million associated with a reduction in other assets  and million from the exercise of employee stock options 
the primary uses of cash during were million of cash paid for interest  million for additions to property  plant and equipment  primarily at our manufacturing locations  million for repurchases of our senior notes  and million for the payment of dividends 
we believe that our liquidity position will provide sufficient funds to meet our current commitments and other cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
funding obligations we have various contractual obligations that we must fund as part of our normal operations 
the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations including the remaining contractual obligations related to our discontinued operations and the periods in which payments are due 
the amounts and time periods are measured from january  total payments due by period payments less than more than due year years years years in thousands long term debt obligations operating lease obligations expected interest payments unconditional purchase obligations pension cash obligations total contractual cash obligations our capital lease obligations are insignificant 
expected interest payments to be made in future periods reflect anticipated interest payments related to the million of our senior notes  million of outstanding senior secured notes  and the million of our outstanding senior subordinated notes 
we have also assumed in the presentation above that these notes will remain outstanding until maturity 
we have excluded from the 
table of contents presentation interest payments and fees related to our revolving credit facilities discussed above  because of the variability and timing of advances and repayments thereunder 
unconditional purchase obligations do not include unconditional purchase obligations that are included as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
our capital expenditure commitments are not significant 
we have two foreign defined benefit plans and a domestic salary continuation plan 
we have presented above the estimated cash obligations that will be paid under these plans over the next ten years 
such amounts are based on several estimates and assumptions and could differ materially should the underlying estimates and assumptions change 
our domestic salary continuation plan is an unfunded plan  and we do not currently have any commitments to make contributions to this plan 
however  we do use insurance instruments to hedge our exposure under the salary continuation plan 
contributions to our other employee benefit plans are at our discretion 
the above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of million  the timing of which payments are uncertain 
see the note entitled taxes on income in item of this report for further information 
critical accounting policies the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimations about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events may not develop as forecasted  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership  which is generally on the date of shipment 
provisions for discounts  sales returns and allowances are estimated using historical experience  current economic trends  and the company s quality performance 
the related provision is recorded as a reduction of sales and cost of sales in the same period that the revenue is recognized 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of net sales for any period if management makes different judgments or uses different estimates 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers are classified in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
shipping and handling costs incurred are classified in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment at the asset group level whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment is indicated 
a loss is then recognized for the difference  if any  between the fair value of the asset as estimated by management using its best judgment and the carrying value of the asset 
if actual market value is less favorable than that estimated by management  additional write downs may be required 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
the carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies in accordance with applicable accounting standards  and are based on management s assumptions and estimates regarding future operating results and levels of taxable income  as well as management s judgment regarding the interpretation of the provisions of applicable accounting standards 
the carrying values of liabilities for income taxes currently payable are based on management s interpretations of applicable tax laws  and incorporate management s assumptions and judgments regarding the use of tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions 
the use of different estimates  assumptions and judgments in connection with accounting for income taxes may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and results of operations 

table of contents we evaluate the recoverability of these deferred tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources  including reversal of taxable temporary differences  forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies 
these sources of income inherently rely heavily on estimates 
we use our historical experience and our short and long term business forecasts to provide insight 
further  our global business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions 
to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered  a valuation allowance is established 
as of january   and january   we had approximately million and million of us federal net operating loss carryforwards  respectively 
in addition  as of january  and january   we had state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
certain of these carryforwards are reserved with a valuation allowance because  based on the available evidence  we believe it is more likely than not that we would not be able to utilize those deferred tax assets in the future 
the remaining year end amounts are expected to be fully recoverable within the applicable statutory expiration periods 
if the actual amounts of taxable income differ from our estimates  the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 
goodwill 
pursuant to applicable accounting standards  we test goodwill for impairment at least annually using a two step approach 
in the first step of this approach  we prepare valuations of reporting units  using both a market comparable approach and an income approach  and those valuations are compared with the respective book values of the reporting units to determine whether any goodwill impairment exists 
in preparing the valuations  past  present and expected future performance is considered 
if impairment is indicated in this first step of the test  a step two valuation approach is performed 
the step two valuation approach compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the book value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including both recognized and unrecognized intangible assets  in the same manner as goodwill is determined in a business combination under applicable accounting standards 
after completion of this step two test  a loss is recognized for the difference  if any  between the fair value of the goodwill associated with the reporting unit and the book value of that goodwill 
if the actual fair value of the goodwill is determined to be less than that estimated  an additional write down may be required 
during the fourth quarters of  and  we performed the annual goodwill impairment test 
we perform this test at the reporting unit level  which is one level below the segment level for the modular carpet segment and at the level of the bentley prince street segment 
for our reporting units which carried a goodwill balance as of january   no impairment of goodwill was indicated 
as of january   if our estimates of the fair value of our reporting units were lower  we believe no additional goodwill impairment would have existed 
in the fourth quarter of  a goodwill impairment of million related to the bentley prince street reporting unit was identified due largely to the following factors there was a significant decline in bentley prince street s performance  primarily in the last three months of this decline also was reflected in the forward projections of bentley prince street s budgeting process 
the projections showed a decline in both sales and operating income over bentley prince street s three year budgeting process 
these declines impacted the value of the business from an income valuation approach 
the declines in projections were primarily related to the global economic crisis and its impact on the broadloom carpet market 
there was an increase in the discount rate used to create the present value of future expected cash flows 
this increase from approximately to was more reflective of our market capitalization and risk premiums on a reporting unit level  which impacted the value of the business using an income valuation approach 
there was a decrease in the market multiple factors used for the market valuation approach 
this decrease was reflective of the general market conditions regarding current market activities and market valuation guidelines 

table of contents inventories 
we determine the value of inventories using the lower of cost or market value 
we write down inventories for the difference between the carrying value of the inventories and their estimated market value 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
we estimate our reserves for inventory obsolescence by continuously examining our inventories to determine if there are indicators that carrying values exceed net realizable values 
experience has shown that significant indicators that could require the need for additional inventory write downs are the age of the inventory  the length of its product life cycles  anticipated demand for our products and current economic conditions 
while we believe that adequate write downs for inventory obsolescence have been made in the consolidated financial statements  consumer tastes and preferences will continue to change and we could experience additional inventory write downs in the future 
our inventory reserve on january   and january   was million and million  respectively 
to the extent that actual obsolescence of our inventory differs from our estimate by  our net income would be higher or lower by approximately million  on an after tax basis 
pension benefits 
net pension expense recorded is based on  among other things  assumptions about the discount rate  estimated return on plan assets and salary increases 
while management believes these assumptions are reasonable  changes in these and other factors and differences between actual and assumed changes in the present value of liabilities or assets of our plans above certain thresholds could cause net annual expense to increase or decrease materially from year to year 
the actuarial assumptions used in our salary continuation plan and our foreign defined benefit plans reporting are reviewed periodically and compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they appropriately account for our future pension benefit obligation 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption is based on weighted average expected returns for each asset class 
expected returns reflect a combination of historical performance analysis and the forward looking views of the financial markets  and include input from actuaries  investment service firms and investment managers 
the table below represents the changes to the projected benefit obligation as a result of changes in discount rates assumptions increase decrease in foreign defined benefit plans projected benefit obligation in millions increase in actuarial assumption for discount rate decrease in actuarial assumption for discount rate increase decrease in domestic salary continuation plan projected benefit obligation in millions increase in actuarial assumption for discount rate decrease in actuarial assumption for discount rate environmental remediation 
we provide for remediation costs and penalties when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable 
remediation liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental exposures and are discounted in certain instances 
we regularly monitor the progress of environmental remediation 
should studies indicate that the cost of remediation is to be more than previously estimated  an additional accrual would be recorded in the period in which such determination is made 
as of january   and january   no significant amounts were provided for remediation liabilities 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
estimating this amount requires us to analyze the financial strengths of our customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
by its nature  such an estimate is highly subjective  and it is possible that the amount of accounts receivable that we are unable to collect may be different than the amount initially estimated 
our allowance for doubtful accounts on january   and january   was million and million  respectively 
to the extent the 
table of contents actual collectability of our accounts receivable differs from our estimates by  our net income would be higher or lower by approximately million  on an after tax basis  depending on whether the actual collectability was better or worse  respectively  than the estimated allowance 
product warranties 
we typically provide limited warranties with respect to certain attributes of our carpet products for example  warranties regarding excessive surface wear  edge ravel and static electricity for periods ranging from ten to twenty years  depending on the particular carpet product and the environment in which the product is to be installed 
we typically warrant that any services performed will be free from defects in workmanship for a period of one year following completion 
in the event of a breach of warranty  the remedy typically is limited to repair of the problem or replacement of the affected product 
we record a provision related to warranty costs based on historical experience and periodically adjust these provisions to reflect changes in actual experience 
our warranty reserve on january   and january   was million and million  respectively 
actual warranty expense incurred could vary significantly from amounts that we estimate 
to the extent the actual warranty expense differs from our estimates by  our net income would be higher or lower by approximately million  on an after tax basis  depending on whether the actual expense is lower or higher  respectively  than the estimated provision 
off balance sheet arrangements we are not a party to any material off balance sheet arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new accounting guidance to amend the criteria for performing step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts and requires performing step if qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
this new guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we do not believe the adoption of this standard will have any significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued new accounting guidance to require additional fair value related disclosures 
it also clarified existing fair value disclosure guidance about the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques 
this new guidance was effective for the first reporting period beginning after december  except for certain disclosure requirements effective for the first reporting period beginning after december  the adoption of this standard did not have any significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued a new accounting standard which provides guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables 
specifically  the new standard requires an entity to allocate consideration at the inception of an arrangement to all of its deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
in the absence of vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of the selling prices  consideration must be allocated to the deliverables based on management s best estimate of the selling prices 
in addition  the new standard eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation 
the standard will be effective for the company in the first quarter of we do not believe the adoption of this standard will have any significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued a new standard which changes the consolidation model for variable interest entities 
this standard requires companies to qualitatively assess the determination of the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie based on whether the entity has the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of the vie  and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
we adopted this standard in the first quarter of and the adoption did not have any significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk as a result of the scope of our global operations  we are exposed to an element of market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
our results of operations and financial condition could be impacted by this risk 
we manage our exposure to market risk through our regular operating and financial activities and  to the extent we deem appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we employ derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes 
we monitor the use of derivative financial instruments through objective measurable systems  well defined market and credit risk limits  and timely reports to senior management according to prescribed guidelines 
we have established strict counter party credit guidelines and enter into transactions only with financial institutions with a rating of investment grade or better 
as a result  we consider the risk of counter party default to be minimal 
interest rate market risk exposure changes in interest rates affect the interest paid on certain of our debt 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates  our management has developed and implemented a policy to maintain the percentage of fixed and variable rate debt within certain parameters 
in the past  we have maintained a fixed variable rate mix within these parameters either by borrowing on a fixed rate basis or entering into interest rate swap transactions 
in the interest rate swaps  we agree to exchange  at specified levels  the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal linked to libor 
as of january   and january   no such interest rate swaps were in place 
foreign currency exchange market risk exposure a significant portion of our operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities in foreign jurisdictions 
we manufacture our products in the united states  england  northern ireland  the netherlands  australia  china and thailand  and sell our products in more than countries 
in  we ceased manufacturing operations at our facility in canada 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products 
our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and many other currencies  including the euro  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  australian dollar  thai baht and japanese yen 
when the us dollar strengthens against a foreign currency  the value of anticipated sales in those currencies decreases  and vice versa 
additionally  to the extent our foreign operations with functional currencies other than the us dollar transact business in countries other than the united states  exchange rate changes between two foreign currencies could ultimately impact us 
finally  because we report in us dollars on a consolidated basis  foreign currency exchange fluctuations could have a translation impact on our financial position 
at january   we recognized a million decrease in our foreign currency translation adjustment account compared with january   because of the strengthening of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies as of year end the decrease was associated primarily with certain foreign subsidiaries located within the united kingdom and europe 
sensitivity analysis for purposes of specific risk analysis  we use sensitivity analysis to measure the impact that market risk may have on the fair values of our market sensitive instruments 
to perform sensitivity analysis  we assess the risk of loss in fair values associated with the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on market sensitive instruments 
the market value of instruments affected by interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk is computed based on the present value of future cash flows as impacted by the changes in the rates attributable to the 
table of contents market risk being measured 
the discount rates used for the present value computations were selected based on market interest and foreign currency exchange rates in effect at january  the values that result from these computations are then compared with the market values of the financial instruments 
the differences are the hypothetical gains or losses associated with each type of risk 
interest rate risk based on a hypothetical immediate basis point increase in interest rates  with all other variables held constant  the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt would be impacted by a net decrease of million 
conversely  a basis point decrease in interest rates would result in a net increase in the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt of million 
foreign currency exchange rate risk as of january   a decrease or increase in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar  with all other variables held constant  would result in a decrease in the fair value of our short term financial instruments primarily cash  accounts receivable and accounts payable of million or an increase in the fair value of our financial instruments of million  respectively 
as the impact of offsetting changes in the fair market value of our net foreign investments is not included in the sensitivity model  these results are not indicative of our actual exposure to foreign currency exchange risk
