as described more fully below  these estimates bear the risk of change due to 
table of contents the inherent uncertainty attached to the estimate 
in some cases  changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ materially from our estimates 
for example  accounting for films and television programs requires us to estimate future revenue and expense amounts which  due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making such estimates  are likely to differ to some extent from actual results 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our financial condition or results of operations will be affected 
we base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis 
for a summary of all of our accounting policies  including the accounting policies discussed below  see note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
accounting for films and television programs 
we capitalize costs of production and acquisition  including financing costs and production overhead  to investment in films and television programs 
these costs for an individual film or television program are amortized and participation and residual costs are accrued to direct operating expenses in the proportion that current year s revenues bear to management s estimates of the ultimate revenue at the beginning of the year expected to be recognized from exploitation  exhibition or sale of such film or television program over a period not to exceed ten years from the date of initial release 
for previously released film or television programs acquired as part of a library  ultimate revenue includes estimates over a period not to exceed years from the date of acquisition 
due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making such estimates of ultimate revenues and expenses  these estimates have differed in the past from actual results and are likely to differ to some extent in the future from actual results 
in addition  in the normal course of our business  some films and titles are more successful than anticipated and some are less successful than anticipated 
the company s management regularly reviews and revises when necessary its ultimate revenue and cost estimates  which may result in a change in the rate of amortization of film costs and participations and residuals and or write down of all or a portion of the unamortized costs of the film or television program to its estimated fair value 
the company s management estimates the ultimate revenue based on experience with similar titles or title genre  the general public appeal of the cast  actual performance when available at the box office or in markets currently being exploited  and other factors such as the quality and acceptance of motion pictures or programs that our competitors release into the marketplace at or near the same time  critical reviews  general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors  many of which we do not control and which may change 
an increase in the estimate of ultimate revenue will generally result in a lower amortization rate and  therefore  less film and television program amortization expense  while a decrease in the estimate of ultimate revenue will generally result in a higher amortization rate and  therefore  higher film and television program amortization expense  and also periodically results in an impairment requiring a write down of the film cost to the title s fair value 
these write downs are included in amortization expense within direct operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the theatrical release of feature films is recognized at the time of exhibition based on our participation in box office receipts 
revenue from the sale of dvds blu ray discs in the retail market  net of an allowance for estimated returns and other allowances  is recognized on the later of receipt by the customer or street date when it is available for sale by the customer 
under revenue sharing arrangements  rental revenue is recognized when we are entitled to receipts and such receipts are determinable 
revenues from television licensing are recognized when the feature film or television program is available to the licensee for telecast 
for television licenses that include separate availability windows during the license period  revenue is allocated over the windows 
revenue from sales to international territories are recognized when access to the feature film or television program has been granted or delivery has occurred  as required under the sales contract  and the right to exploit the feature film or television program has commenced 
for multiple media rights contracts with a fee for a single film or television program where the contract provides for media holdbacks defined as contractual media release restrictions  the fee is allocated to the various media based on our assessment of the relative fair value of the rights to exploit each media and is recognized as each holdback is released 
for multiple title contracts with a fee  the fee is allocated on a title by title basis  based on our assessment of the relative fair value of each title 
the primary estimate requiring the most subjectivity and judgment involving revenue recognition is the estimate of sales returns associated with our revenue from the sale of dvd s blu ray discs in the retail market which is discussed separately below under the caption sales returns allowance 

table of contents sales returns allowance 
revenues are recorded net of estimated returns and other allowances 
we estimate reserves for dvd blu ray returns based on previous returns experience  point of sale data available from certain retailers  current economic trends  and projected future sales of the title to the consumer based on the actual performance of similar titles on a title by title basis in each of the dvd blu ray businesses 
factors affecting actual returns include  among other factors  limited retail shelf space at various times of the year  success of advertising or other sales promotions  and the near term release of competing titles 
we believe that our estimates have been materially accurate in the past  however  due to the judgment involved in establishing reserves  we may have adjustments to our historical estimates in the future 
our estimate of future returns affects reported revenue and operating income 
if we underestimate the impact of future returns in a particular period  then we may record less revenue in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amounts 
if we overestimate the impact of future returns in a particular period  then we may record additional revenue in later periods when returns are less than estimated 
an incremental change of in our estimated sales returns rate ie  provisions for returns divided by gross sales of related product for home entertainment products would have had an approximately million impact on our total revenue in the fiscal year ended march  provisions for accounts receivable 
we estimate provisions for accounts receivable based on historical experience and relevant facts and information regarding the collectability of the accounts receivable 
in performing this evaluation  significant judgments and estimates are involved  including an analysis of specific risks on a customer by customer basis for our larger customers and an analysis of the length of time receivables have been past due 
the financial condition of a given customer and its ability to pay may change over time or could be better or worse than anticipated and could result in an increase or decrease to our allowance for doubtful accounts  which  when the impact of such change is material  is disclosed in our discussion on direct operating expenses elsewhere in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes 
we are subject to federal and state income taxes in the us  and in several foreign jurisdictions 
we record deferred tax assets  net of applicable reserves  related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences 
we recognize a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not or a valuation allowance is applied 
in order to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets we will need to generate sufficient taxable income in the future 
because of our historical operating losses  we have provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
however  the assessment as to whether there will be sufficient taxable income to realize our net deferred tax assets is an estimate which could change in the future depending primarily upon the actual performance of our company 
when we have a history of profitable operations sufficient to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized  the valuation allowance or a portion of the valuation allowance will be reversed and reflected as a benefit in the income tax provision 
after that we will be required to continually evaluate the more likely than not assessment that our net deferred tax assets will be realized and if operating results deteriorate we may need to reestablish all or a portion of the valuation allowance through a charge to our income tax provision 
goodwill 
goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment within each fiscal year or between the annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
we perform our annual impairment test as of january in each fiscal year 
we performed our last annual impairment test on our goodwill as of january  no goodwill impairment was identified in any of our reporting units 
determining the fair value of reporting units requires various assumptions and estimates 
the estimates of fair value include consideration of the future projected operating results and cash flows of the reporting unit 
such projections could be different than actual results 
should actual results be significantly less than estimates  the value of our goodwill could be impaired in the future 
convertible senior subordinated notes 
we account for our convertible senior subordinated notes by separating the liability and equity components 
the liability component is recorded at the date of issuance based on its fair value which is generally determined in a manner that will reflect an interest cost equal to our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the convertible senior subordinated notes issuance date 
the amount of the proceeds less the amount recorded as the liability component is recorded as an addition to shareholders equity reflecting the equity component ie  conversion feature 
the difference between the principal amount and the amount recorded as the liability component represents the debt discount 
the carrying amount of the liability is accreted up to the principal amount through the amortization of the discount  using the effective interest method  to interest expense over the 
table of contents expected life of the note 
the determination of the fair value of the liability component is an estimate dependent on a number of factors including estimates of market rates for similar non convertible debt instruments at the date of issuance 
a higher value attributable to the liability component results in a lower value attributed to the equity component and therefore a smaller discount amount and lower interest cost as a result of amortization of the smaller discount 
a lower value attributable to the liability component results in a higher value attributed to the equity component and therefore a larger discount amount and higher interest cost as a result of amortization of the larger discount 
business acquisitions 
the company accounts for its business acquisitions as a purchase  whereby the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value 
the excess of the purchase price over estimated fair value of the net identifiable assets is allocated to goodwill 
determining the fair value of assets and liabilities requires various assumptions and estimates 
these estimates and assumptions are refined with adjustments recorded to goodwill as information is gathered and final appraisals are completed over a one year allocation period 
the changes in these estimates or different assumptions used in determining these estimates could impact the amount of assets  including goodwill and liabilities  ultimately recorded in our balance sheet and could impact our operating results subsequent to such acquisition 
we believe that our assumptions and estimates have been materially accurate in the past 
recent accounting pronouncements consolidation accounting for variable interest entities 
this new accounting guidance modifies the previous guidance in relation to the identification of controlling financial interests in a variable interest entity vie 
under this new guidance  the primary beneficiary of a vie is the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics  among others a the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance  and b the obligation to absorb losses of the entity  or the right to receive benefits from the entity  that could potentially be significant to the vie 
if an enterprise determines that power is shared among multiple unrelated parties such that no one party has the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact the vie s economic performance  then no party is the primary beneficiary 
power is shared if each of the parties sharing power are required to consent to the decisions relating to the activities that most significantly impact the vie s performance 
the provisions of this standard became effective for us beginning in fiscal upon adoption of the new accounting standard  on april   we determined that we are no longer the primary beneficiary of tv guide network because the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of tv guide network are shared with the owner of tv guide network  oep 
although we own a interest in tv guide network  the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of tv guide network are held by the board of managers pursuant to the operating agreement of tv guide entertainment group llc 
accordingly  upon adoption of the new accounting standard  we are no longer consolidating tv guide network and instead are accounting for tv guide network under the equity method of accounting 
we have applied the provisions of the new accounting standard retrospectively and  accordingly  we deconsolidated tv guide network from may   the date we sold a interest to oep  and retrospectively adjusted the financial statements to reflect tv guide network as if it were accounted for under the equity method of accounting since that date 
the deconsolidation of tv guide network resulted in the reclassification of million of assets  million of liabilities and million of non controlling interest amounts from each of their respective consolidated balance sheet captions to the investment in equity method investee s account as of march   reflecting the carrying amount of the company s interest in the mandatorily redeemable preferred and common stock units of tv guide network as of march  in addition  under the equity method of accounting  our share of the revenues  expenses of tv guide network and income for the accretion of the dividend and discount of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock are recorded net in the equity interest line item in the consolidated statements of operations 
the adoption of the new accounting standard did not impact the company s net loss

table of contents feature films and participated in a pro rata portion of the pictures net profits or losses similar to a co production arrangement based on the portion of costs funded 
amounts provided from pride were reflected as a participation liability 
in late  the administrative agent for the senior lenders under pride s senior credit facility took the position  among others  that the senior lenders did not have an obligation to continue to fund under the senior credit facility because the conditions precedent to funding set forth in the senior credit facility could not be satisfied 
we were not a party to the credit facility 
consequently  pride did not purchase the pictures the spirit  my bloody valentine d and madea goes to jail 
thereafter  on april   after failed attempts by us to facilitate a resolution  we gave filmco and pride notice that filmco  through pride s failure to make certain capital contributions  was in default of the master picture purchase agreement 
on may   the representative for the pride equity and the pride mezzanine investor responded that the required amount was fully funded and that it had no further obligations to make any additional capital contributions 
consequently  on may   we gave notice of termination of the master picture purchase agreement 
since may   there have been no developments with respect to the arrangement 
although we will no longer receive financing as provided from the participation of pride in our films  we do not believe this will have a material adverse effect to our business

anticipated cash requirements

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency and interest rate risk management market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our exposure to interest rate risk results from the financial debt instruments that arise from transactions entered into during the normal course of business 
as part of our overall risk management program  we evaluate and manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and currency exchange risks on an ongoing basis 
hedges and derivative financial instruments will be used in the future in order to manage our interest rate and currency exposure 
we have no intention of entering into financial derivative contracts  other than to hedge a specific financial risk 
currency rate risk 
we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposures on future production expenses denominated in various foreign currencies 
as of march   we had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts to sell canadian million in exchange for us million over a period of three months at a weighted average exchange rate of one canadian dollar equals us 
we also had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts to sell british pound sterling million in exchange for us million over a period of twelve months at a weighted average exchange rate of one british pound sterling equals us 
changes in the fair value representing a net unrealized fair value loss on foreign exchange contracts that qualified as effective hedge contracts outstanding during the year ended march  amounted to million and are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss  a separate component of shareholders equity 
these contracts are entered into with a major financial institution as counterparty 
we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty  which is limited to the cost of replacing the contracts  at current market rates 
we do not require collateral or other security to support these contracts 
interest rate risk 
certain of the company s borrowings primarily borrowings under its senior revolving credit facility  certain production loans and the film credit facility  are  and are expected to continue to be  at variable rates of interest and expose the company to interest rate risk 
if interest rates increase  the company s debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same  and its net income would decrease 
the applicable margin with respect to loans under the senior revolving credit facility is a percentage per annum equal to plus an adjusted rate based on libor 
the applicable margin with respect to loans under the film credit facility is a percentage per annum equal to over the libo rate as defined in the film credit facility agreement 
assuming the senior revolving credit facility and the film credit facility are fully drawn  based on the applicable libor in effect as of march   each quarter point change in interest rates would result in a million change in annual interest expense on the senior revolving credit facility and million change in annual interest expense on the film credit facility 
the variable interest production loans incur interest at rates ranging from approximately to and applicable margins ranging from over libor to over the greater of libor or 
a quarter point increase of the interest rates on the outstanding principal amount of our variable rate production loans would result in million in additional costs capitalized to the respective film or television asset
