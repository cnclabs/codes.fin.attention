summary of twelve months ended december  for the year ended december   we continued to report strong growth and financial performance 
revenue increased by  reaching million  as compared to million in the year ended december  this growth was primarily due to an increase in sales of existing products and an increase in the proportion of sales of new products 
this is consistent with our strategy to launch new products in an increasingly competitive market and to further penetrate the domestic prc market 
net income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from million in our net income figures for years ended december  and include gains and losses resulting from changes in derivative warrant liability and our net income for the year ended december  included the positive effect of a one time million adjustment of our bad debt allowance during the third quarter of without the effect of the changes in derivative warrant liability and the one time adjustment for bad debt allowance  management estimates that net income would have been million and million in and  respectively 
please see the discussion of the reconciliation of these non gaap measures with gaap figures in the net income section below 
on this more comparable basis  our net income for would have been higher than our net income in from a profitability perspective  our gross margin for the year ended december  was compared to in while pricing pressure is present in the overall pharmaceutical market  we believe we can still maintain our gross margin of approximately 
however  we are seeing a tighter market in raw materials for our products which could translate to higher material costs in the quarters to come 
cash flow from operations for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of  as compared to million in the decrease in cash flow from operations in was mainly the result of higher working capital usage from higher advances to suppliers and inventory levels in compared to although we experienced better collection performance of account receivables in  it was not enough to offset the increase from other working capital usages 
earnings per common share basic and diluted for the year ended december  reached per share compared to per share for the months ended december  this was also affected by changes in derivative warrant liability and the one time bad debt estimate adjustment of million in september of without the effect of this bad debt adjustment and the changes in derivative warrant liability  earnings per share would have been and in and respectively

business overview recent developments in the year ended december   we continued to execute our business strategy of expanding revenues from our core portfolio of products while continuing the development process of new products 
of our existing products  during the year we saw our digestive diseases product category take a lead in sales growth by increasing compared to the prior year period 
our other product category saw very healthy growth due to greater demand of vitamin b as a result of it being placed on the national essential drug list in the prc 
both of our cns  cardio cerebral vascular and anti viro infection respiratory product categories  the other two of our four product categories  also experienced significant growth 
the products in our pipe line are also progressing along the development process and getting closer to product launch 
in early we completed the clinical trials for candesartan  a front line drug therapy we developed for the treatment of hypertension 
we have submitted a production approval application to the sfda for candesartan and are expecting approval within the next six months 
the clinical trial for rosuvastatin  or the generic version of crestor  was completed in december and we are in the process of applying for the production approval for this product 
in september  we also completed phase i of our clinical trial for our new antibiotic combination drug 
we are currently moving ahead and are in phase ii of the trial for this drug 
set forth below are some of our recent milestones first quarter submitted application for production approval of candesartan  a front line drug therapy we developed for the treatment of hypertension 
since then  we have completed all testing procedures for this new product  and we are currently waiting for the final production approval from the sfda 
third quarter we completed the phase i clinical trials of our novel cephalosporin based combination antibiotic 
in phase i  the clinical trials focused on the study of clinical pharmacology as well as the evaluation of safety on the human body  through observing tolerance and pharmacokinetics to provide support for dosage and drug delivery design 
phase ii of the trial has commenced 
fourth quarter of clinical trial for rosuvastatin  a generic form of crestor  a drug for indication of high blood cholesterol level  was completed and we have since submitted an application for production approval 
fourth quarter of we received the national high tech enterprise status national ht status from the prc government  as recognized by the ministry of science and technology of china  the ministry of finance  and the state administration of taxation 
with this designation  we are entitled to a preferential tax rate of for the coming three years  which is notably lower than the statutory income tax rate of 
market trends the growth of china s pharmaceutical market is driven by china s rapid economic growth 
increased healthcare spending by the chinese government to reform the healthcare system has already greatly improved the accessibility of  and desire for  medical care 
important additional factors include the aging of the population and the resulting increase in age related disorders  the urban migration of the population  and improved awareness of personal health care 
the healthcare reform program announced by the chinese government in late is having a significant impact on all healthcare related industries in china  including the pharmaceutical industry 
over all  the government plans to provide a basic  universal healthcare system to all citizens of china 
in  the government began to broadly implement the policies from the healthcare reform 
in this respect  products on the essential drug list edl are expected to experience an increase in volume but a reduction in their prices  which will have an adverse affect on their net margins 
however  the price adjustments announced by the government have been milder than the market originally anticipated 
additionally  the chinese government wants to set a pricing target range high and low  to ensure that the prices of essential drugs are affordable while also allowing drug companies to make a fair profit 
we have seen first hand the increase in demand for the two edl products in our product portfolio cefalexin and vitamin b 
along with the increase in demand of these products  we also observed some degradation in the pricing of these products in compared to we also feel some pricing pressure present in our industry brought on by the recent healthcare reform program 
results of operations for the year ended december  the following tables presents our results of operations for the years ended december  and twelve months ended december st change chg revenue cost of revenue gross profit selling expenses general and admin expenses bad debt expense benefit income from operations other expenses derivative gain loss income tax expense net income basic net income per share basic weighted average shares outstanding diluted net income per share diluted weighted average shares outstanding revenue for the year ended december   our sales revenue was million  an increase of  compared to million in set forth below are our revenues by product category in millions usd for the years ended december  and product category twelve months ended december net change change cns cerebral cardio vascular anti viro infection respiratory digestive diseases other the most significant revenue growth was in our digestive diseases product category  which generated million in sales revenue compared to million a year ago  an increase of million  or 
this increase was driven by two new drugs tiopronin  a drug prescribed for treatments of acute hepatitis b and drug induced liver damage  and omeprazole sodium  a generic gastroesophageal reflux disease gerd drug we launched in the fourth quarter of that has quickly become one of our revenue growth leaders 
our other product category sales rose to million from million  an increase of million  or 
the increase in revenue of the other category was mainly driven by increased sales of vitamin b sales of this product grew after vitamin b was placed on the edl in our cns  cardio cerebral vascular category experienced increased sales in after being relatively flat in this category generated million of sales  compared to million in the previous year  or an increase of 
finally  sales of the anti viro infection respiratory category increased by to million in compared to million in in the year ended december   revenue breakdown by product category showed small changes and the four categories are now more even than compared to the previous year 
sales of the anti viro respiratory products category represented of total sales in the year ended on december   compared to in the cns  cerebral cardio vascular category represented of total revenue compared to in the digestive diseases category represented of total revenue in compared to in the other category represented and of revenues in and  respectively 
we have a diversified portfolio of products with no single product representing more than of total revenue 
cost of revenue for the year ended december   our cost of revenue was million  or of total revenue  which represented an increase of million from million  or of total revenue  in the increase in the cost of revenue during was primarily attributable to the higher volume of products sold in gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from million in our gross profit margin in was  compared to in from a product sales structure perspective  we sold more lower margin products in compared to  including products that are listed on the edl 
while sales growth in our new and relatively higher margin products such as tiopronin and omeprazole sodium helped to support overall margin  it was not enough to offset the sales growth of lower margin products 
going forward we expect to see continued pricing pressure but new products such as candesartan and rosuvastatin could help to support overall gross margin once they are launched 
however  recent tight market conditions in the raw materials market could be somewhat problematic if sustained 
selling expenses our selling expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of approximately  compared to million in selling expenses accounted for of the total revenue in compared to in our overall selling expense to revenue ratio is stable 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of approximately  or  compared to million in general and administrative expenses accounting for and of our total revenues in and  respectively 
the increase in our general and administrative expenses was mainly due to an increase in stock based compensation including stock options and a one time issuance of warrants to a consultant  and an increase in our depreciation and amortization costs 
bad debt expenses benefit due to the peculiarity of the chinese pharmaceutical market environment  deferred payments to pharmaceutical companies by state owned hospitals and local medicine distributors are a normal phenomenon 
over of our drugs are sold to state owned hospitals and local medicine distributors  which creates slow collections of our trade receivables 
since the majority of hospitals in china are backed by the government  management believes that the deferred payments from state owned hospitals are secure and will eventually be collected 
so far  we have not written off any receivables in our year history of doing business with hospitals 
because we have comparatively long receivable cycles  management set very conservative bad debt allowance estimates in our early years as a public company 
over the past few years  our collection record has been good with a record of not losing any receivables 
during  we reviewed our bad debt allowance estimate to align our estimates with our actual experience and industry collection standards 
after analyzing a number of factors including macro economy and industry bad debt experience rates  management revised our bad debt allowance estimates and adjusted our bad debt allowance down to million from million during the third quarter of this represented a bad debt benefit of million 
currently we continue to record allowances for bad debts based on the age of outstanding accounts receivables at the end of the period 
the percentage of a trade receivable that is deemed doubtful is determined as follows after days  after days  and for up to days 
we believe that this formula for calculating our bad debt allowance enables us to correctly account for any contingent bad debt risk 
for the year ended december   our bad debt expense was million compared to a bad debt benefit of million we recorded in as of december   our total allowance for bad debt is income from operations our operating income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in  an increase of million 
the main reasons for this increase were our higher gross profits in and the effect of a one time adjustment in our bad debt allowance that created a benefit of million during the period

as of december   our cash and cash equivalents outstanding was million  which represents of our total assets  an increase of approximately  from million as of december  as of december   we had a principal balance of million in short term bank loans 
the combination of cash flow generated from operating activities and cash flow from financing activities funded the new purchases of our intangible assets drug formulas 
on december   we had working capital of million  an increase of million from the million working capital we had on december  the reasons for the increase were an increase in account receivables as well as increases in inventory and advances to suppliers 
during  we continued our vigorous collection efforts from our customers and achieved good results 
while we have made progress  improving our accounts receivable collection continues to be a focus of our management team and we expect to make further progress in the quarters to come 
based on our current operating plan  management believes that our cash provided by operations plus the proceeds from our existing bank loans will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and our anticipated capital expenditures  including expenditures for new formula acquisitions  for the next twelve months 
however  if events or circumstances occur and we do not meet our operating plan as expected  we may be required to seek additional capital and or to reduce certain discretionary spending  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business objectives 
notwithstanding the foregoing  we may seek additional financing as necessary for expansion purposes and when we believe market conditions are most advantageous  which may include debt and or equity financing 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all

investing activities in the year ended december   net cash used in investment activities was million  a decrease of million  compared to the million in the decrease in investment spending in was mainly due to the higher than normal investment expenditure in as such  our investment in intangible assets in was of total revenue 
in the year ended december   net cash flow generated from financing activities was million compared to million in the same period of the main source of the financing came from the exercise of outstanding warrants  which resulted in the issuance  shares of common stock at the price of per share  generating net proceeds of million 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
commitments as of december   we had no material commitments except for those expenditures incurred in the ordinary course of business
