business overview and presentation was a year of significant strategic and financial accomplishments for advanced energy 
having emerged from one of the most severe declines the capital equipment industry has ever experienced  fiscal was characterized by credit constraints in the financial markets and a weak global economy that negatively impacted all of the markets we serve 
saw an equally unparalleled rebound 
advanced energy demonstrated speed and flexibility in responding to the changing market conditions and needs of its customers  generating nearly million in total revenue and in diluted earnings per share 

table of contents business acquisition and disposition of the many milestones we achieved in  the most noteworthy came in the form of strategic endeavors 
first  we expanded our solar inverter business with the acquisition of pv powered in may  a privately held oregon corporation based in bend  oregon 
pv powered is a leading manufacturer of grid tie pv inverters in the residential  commercial and utility scale markets 
the distinctive combination of pv s exceptional line of products with our high powered solarons has afforded us a position among the leaders in one of the fastest growing markets for inverters  the north american solar inverter market 
we further focused these efforts by divesting our gas flow control business in october  which included our aera mass flow control and related product lines  to hitachi metals  ltd 
additional information on the sales price  payment terms and other financial data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  in item of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
note operations and summary of significant accounting policies and estimates to our consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the accounting positions described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates 
such accounting positions require significant judgments  assumptions  and estimates to be used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on variability in factors affecting these statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales upon transfer of title and risk of loss to our customers provided that there is evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable and the collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
in most transactions  we have no obligations to our customers after the date products are shipped other than pursuant to warranty obligations 
for customers purchasing our renewables products  we provide installation  support and services after the product has been shipped 
we defer the fair value of any undelivered elements until the undelivered element is delivered 
fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers  if any  are recognized as revenue 
the related shipping and handling costs are recognized in cost of sales 
we maintain a credit approval process and we make significant judgments in connection with assessing our customers ability to pay at the time of shipment 
the customers purchasing our renewables products require larger credit limits than those purchasing our thin film products 
despite this assessment  from time to time  our customers are unable to meet their payment obligations 
we continuously monitor our customers credit worthiness  and use our judgment in establishing a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  there is no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of accounts receivable and our future operating results 
inventory we value our inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision to write down excess and obsolete inventory to its estimated net realizable value  if less than cost  based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand 
demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
our industry is subject to technological change  new 
table of contents product development and product technological obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
therefore  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
warranty costs we provide for the estimated costs to fulfill customer warranty obligations upon the recognition of the related revenue 
we offer warranty coverage for a majority of our thin film products for periods typically ranging from to months after shipment 
we warrant our solar inverter products for five to ten years 
we estimate the anticipated costs of repairing our products under such warranties based on the historical costs of the repairs and any known specific product issues 
the assumptions we use to estimate warranty accruals are reevaluated periodically in light of actual experience and  when appropriate  the accruals are adjusted 
should product failure rates differ from our estimates  actual costs could vary significantly from our expectations 
intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets we completed our acquisition of pv powered in may for a total cost of million 
in addition  we sold our gas flow control business for approximately million 
as a result of our acquisition  we recorded intangible assets and goodwill 
goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing as well as testing upon the occurrence of any event that indicates a potential impairment 
intangible assets and other long lived assets are subject to an impairment test if there is an indicator of impairment 
the carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon our estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use 
if our expectations of future results and cash flows are significantly diminished  intangible assets  long lived assets and goodwill may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles or other long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we use the projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine whether an impairment exists  and then measure the impairment using discounted cash flows and other fair value measurements 
to measure impairment for goodwill  we compare the fair value of our reporting units by measuring discounted cash flows to the book value of the reporting units 
goodwill would be impaired if the resulting implied fair value of goodwill was less than the recorded book value of the goodwill 
the estimation of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control 
changes in these estimates can result in significant revisions to our carrying value of these assets and may result in material charges to our results of operations 
income taxes we assess the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
our assessment includes a number of factors  including historical results and taxable income projections for each jurisdiction 
the ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent on the generation of taxable income in appropriate jurisdictions during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible 
we consider our scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in determining the amount of our valuation allowance 
accounting for income taxes requires a two step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate our tax position by determining if  based on the technical merits  it is more likely than not that our position will be sustained upon audit  including resolutions of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity 

table of contents although we believe our tax estimates and reserves  including those for uncertain tax positions  are reasonable  including those relied upon in the execution of our entity restructuring  there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in our current or historical income tax provisions and accruals  which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
business environment and trends semiconductors the industry has witnessed some underlying changes as we exited the increase of capital investment that occurred throughout the year slowed to some extent in the fourth quarter  particularly in the area of mm semiconductor tools wafer production 
suppliers across the industry were negatively impacted as the current round of investment ended for several large manufacturers 
we anticipate the resumption of capital investment over the course of the year or potentially sooner  given that a number of manufacturers have announced plans for new rounds of capital expenditure primarily for mm wafer production 
additionally  we believe a fundamental shift is occurring as the industry moves from dynamic random access memory dram to nand flash memory for use in tablet pcs such as ipads 
there has also been growth in solid state drives 
dram has been the predominant driver of the semiconductor industry over the last six quarters  but as the industry moves towards nand flash memory  we expect an impact in a number of companies and regions such as korea 
the increased focus on nand flash memory may result in market share shifts  towards those strong in nand and etch tool technology 
we also believe some manufacturers are re purposing fabrication lines in order to enter the foundry business and will require additional investment 
another industry driver was the re tooling of mm wafer fabs  which led to significant growth in sales of used tools and legacy products for oems 
this shift to older products was driven by demand for electronic components that do not required mm  such as analog circuits for power electronics in automobiles 
more recently however  mm tools are again being shipped as fabs prepare for the next technological shift and further capacity increases 
flat panel display we have seen several quarters of increasing revenue and capital investment largely centered around higher generation lcd panels generation and above 
looking ahead  there are a variety of non traditional market factors that may stimulate the next round of capital investment by equipment manufacturers  such as more complex technologies and smaller panels for tablet pcs  as well as proximity touch screens and led back lighting 
we anticipate capacity additions for lcd and more technology advancements around organic light emitting diodes oleds  especially in korea 
while the exact timeline of investment cycles can be challenging to pinpoint in this market  we believe they will occur in the next to months 
we are working diligently to position ourselves with the right customers  such as those in korea  and the right products in order to capitalize on these trends and drive sales 
while this continues to be a somewhat unpredictable market  we expect to see an increase in sales during the second half of the year  specifically in etch tools 
thin film renewables throughout  we saw strong demand for our crystalline silicon pv products in both europe and the prc 
we anticipate investment and demand for these products to remain stable for most of there have been indications of a slowdown in the european market as governments in many european countries have reduced available incentives and feed in tariffs  but the chinese market is expected to grow due to the chinese government s investment in solar panel manufacturing capacity 
the north american market grew in as larger megawatt output solar array projects resulted in an increase in the demand for solar panels 
we anticipate that consumption of inventory will slow demand slightly in early  but capacity for panel manufacturing remains high and we believe this will drive sales higher in the second half of the year 

table of contents inverter we experienced exponential growth in the inverter market in along with the global expansion of our solaron inverter product into europe  this increase was also driven by our acquisition of pv powered 
the majority of our sales in the inverter market continue to come from commercial and utility scale applications  particularly for large central inverters over kw and our mw integrated power sub station solutions 
market demand in europe may slow in because of changes to and or reductions in feed in tariff incentives in certain countries  but we anticipate growth in demand in north america due to lucrative government incentives in canada as well as planned investment by utilities in the united states 
as a result of the above factors and full year of inverter revenue associated with the acquisition of pv powered  sales in this market will increase in as compared to results of operations our analysis presented below is organized to provide the information we believe will be instructive for understanding our historical performance and relevant trends going forward 
our results of operations include the operating results of pv powered for the period may  through december  operating results applicable to our gas flow control business are excluded from our results of continuing operations for all periods presented 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  in item of this annual report on form k

in thousands semiconductor capital equipment market non semiconductor capital equipment total product global support total sales years ended december  semiconductor capital equipment market non semiconductor capital equipment total product global support total sales total sales total sales for the twelve months ended december  increased to million from million for the twelve months ended december  the increase in sales was driven by a recovery in all of the end markets that we serve along with the continued expansion of our global footprint  particularly in europe  for sales of our solaron inverter 
our acquisition of pv powered on may  added an additional million in sales from may  to december  total sales decreased to million in as compared to this reflected significantly reduced demand in for manufacturing equipment and services due to extremely unfavorable global economic and industry conditions 
the global negative trends in customer spending and the pervasive economic uncertainty made many of our customers significantly reduce their factory operations and cut back their capital spending plans for capacity expansion 
this severely impacted the demand for our products for the market has recovered significantly in semiconductor market sales in  semiconductor market sales rose to million  or of sales  from million  or of sales in we believe that demand in the semiconductor capital equipment market continued to grow throughout as technology investments at foundries drove a rebuilding of inventory to satisfy the consumer electronics market 
in the near term  we expect that a transition from dynamic random access memory to flash memory will result in continued investment in new products and capacity in the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
we expect our sales in this market to be similar to that of sales to the semiconductor capital equipment market decreased in as compared to as end market demand for products that included semiconductors fell in the wake of the global economic crisis 
the drop in demand reduced factory use and significantly reduced the need for semiconductor fabrication expansion 
the semiconductor capital equipment market was severely affected by these developments and demand for our products in these markets decreased from previous levels 
non semiconductor market sales total sales to the non semiconductor capital equipment markets increased to million  or of sales  in compared to million  or of sales  in the markets that comprise 
table of contents our non semiconductor capital equipment markets include flat panel display  solar panel  data storage  architectural glass and other industrial thin film manufacturing equipment markets and our solar inverter market 
with the exception of the solar inverter market  our customers in these markets are predominantly large oem s for new equipment 
our customers in the solar inverter market are predominantly large system integrators  independent power producers and public utilities 
the increase in non semiconductor sales was due to capacity expansion in the flat panel display market  capacity expansion in the solar panel market  growth of solar array installations in the us and europe for solar inverters and the addition of pv powered to our revenue stream 
total sales to our non semiconductor equipment markets declined in as compared to as these markets were also adversely affected by the pervasive factors previously mentioned  including the credit constraints in the financial markets and the negative trends in consumer spending 
the drop in end market demand reduced factory use and significantly reduced the need for capacity expansion in our non semiconductor markets 
sales to customers in the flat panel market increased to million  or of total sales in as compared to million  or of total sales  in in this market  we are seeing a continued cycle of investing by panel manufacturers in korea and the prc which is driven by the market adoption of flat panels by chinese consumers  the growth in touch screens for tablet pcs and smart phones and the migration of new technology such as led backlighting and d televisions around the world 
we anticipate continued investment in touch panel technology in and our near term expectation is that sales in the flat panel market will increase slightly in flat panel market sales decreased in as compared to because of the overall economic downturn described earlier 
sales to customers in the solar panel market increased to million  or of total sales  in as compared to million  or of total sales  in throughout  we saw strong demand for our crystalline silicon pv products in both europe and the prc 
we anticipate investment and demand for these products to remain stable for most of there have been indications of a slowdown in the european market as governments in many european countries have reduced available incentives and feed in tariffs 
the prc market is expected to grow due to the prc government s investment in solar panel manufacturing capacity 
the north american market grew in as larger megawatt output solar array projects resulted in an increase in the demand for solar panels 
we anticipate that consumption of inventory will slow demand slightly in early  but capacity for panel manufacturing remains high and we believe this will drive sales higher in the second half of the year 
solar panel manufacturers installed substantial panel manufacturing capacity prior to  and as a result of declining panel sales caused in part by the global recession  built significant inventory 
the majority of solar panel manufacturers must work through their current inventory levels before their factory use will be at a point where they will need to expand capacity 
this  and the general world wide economic decline  resulted in decreased sales to customers in the solar market by in as compared to sales to the solar inverter market grew  to million  or of total sales  in  as compared to million  or of total sales  in along with the global expansion of our solaron inverter product  this increase was also driven by our acquisition of pv powered 
the majority of our sales in the inverter market continues to come from commercial and utility scale applications 
the addition of pv powered s product portfolio expands the range of power capacities in which we can compete and added a line of residential inverters 
we successfully installed our first inverters in the european market in and expect continued penetration in that market during market demand in europe may slow in because of changes to and or reductions in feed in tariff incentives in certain countries  but we anticipate growth in demand in north america due to lucrative government incentives in canada as well as planned investment by utilities in the united states 
as a result of the above factors and full year of inverter revenue associated with the acquisition of pv powered  sales in this market will increase in as compared to sales to the solar inverter market increased from million in to million in because of increased demand from commercial markets 

table of contents global support revenue global support revenue grew to million  or of total sales  in compared to million  representing of sales  in the increase in global support sales was due to an increase in factory utilization by our customers throughout  which drove demand for repairs  replacement parts and inventory restocking 
the outlook for our service business in continues to be strong as we take advantage of a growing trend in the market related to reuse and repurposing of used equipment 
factory utilization is very high currently and our customers are looking to us to provide them with used and refurbished equipment to be used as spares for their fabrication lines 
additionally  we expect our service business in the inverter market to continue to grow as we increase the number of solar pv sites under operations and maintenance contracts 
sales from our global support business decreased in as compared to in part from a continuing practice by our customers of using spare parts inventory and idle equipment for spare parts in efforts to conserve cash as opposed to repairing malfunctioning or worn parts 
applied materials inc  our largest customer  accounted for million  or of our sales in  million  or  of our sales in  and million  or  of our sales in our sales to applied materials included sales for the semiconductor capital equipment market  as well as the solar and flat panel display markets 
gross profit our gross profit was million  or of revenue in  million  or of revenue  in and million  or of revenue  in the large increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in when compared to was due to an overall boost in production volume and increased leverage from factory overhead  plus reduced warranty costs as a percent of total sales resulting from lower warranty claims 
we expect our gross profit to decrease slightly as a percentage of sales during since the gross margins related to our renewable inverter product is lower than the gross margins related to our traditional thin films business 
we anticipate gross margins to increase in terms of absolute dollars due to an increase in overall sales volume for the decrease in our gross profit  in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue  in as compared to was due to an overall decrease in production volume related to the weakness in the economy resulting in a lack of absorption of our factory costs therefore reducing our gross margin 
in response to the decrease in production volume in we reduced our overall manufacturing costs by reducing fixed production and overhead costs including personnel costs and discretionary spending 
operating expense the following table summarizes our operating expenses as a percentage of sales for the years ended  and years ended december  dollars in thousands research and development selling  general and administrative impairment of goodwill amortization of intangible assets restructuring charges total operating expenses in response to the extremely unfavorable global economic and industry conditions  we implemented cost reductions in some of the cost reductions were business restructuring which were permanent in 
table of contents nature 
these included reductions of personnel headcounts across all functions and geographies and consolidation of facilities on a worldwide basis 
additionally  we implemented cost cutting initiatives that were more temporary in nature such as cuts in discretionary spending  including travel expense and professional fees  as well as pay cuts for management level personnel  company wide shutdowns and reductions in employee benefits 
in order to meet the current level of demand  as well as implement strategic projects that drive continued international growth and sales opportunities  we increased headcount in and  as a result  incurred more discretionary spending in than in the rapid increase in demand in the markets we serve has challenged our production capacity as well as our ability to meet the tight deadlines of our customers 
as a result  we increased spending in our production facilities in order to meet our customers demands and take full advantage of the market opportunities presented to us in additionally  we added employees and operating expenses related to the acquisition of pv powered as well as for the infrastructure necessary to expand our global presence to new markets throughout the world 
while these increases were necessary to successfully manage the current rate and speed of our business  we remain committed to sustaining prudent spending levels 
research and development the markets we serve constantly present opportunities to develop products for new or emerging applications and require technological changes driving for higher performance  lower cost  and other attributes that will advance our customers products 
we believe that continued and timely development of new and differentiated products  as well as enhancements to existing products to support customer requirements  are critical for us to compete in the markets we serve 
accordingly  we devote significant personnel and financial resources to the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products  and we expect these investments to continue 
all of our research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
the increase in research and development expenses of million in the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in was driven primarily by slight increases in personnel costs  including the reversal of the temporary cost control efforts implemented in and  outside consulting and travel 
additionally  this variance includes increased spending as a result of the engineering personnel absorbed in the pv powered acquisition 
we continue to focus on new product development and  although we have maintained a very cautious approach to our discretionary spending in  we anticipate that research and development expenses will continue to increase in in terms of absolute dollars  due to a full year of employee costs related to the acquisition of pv powered 
research and development costs should decrease as a percentage of sales 
the decrease in research and development expenses of million in as compared to was driven primarily by decreases of million in personnel costs  million in engineering material  and million in travel costs 
the large decrease in engineering material was offset by an million charge for excess engineering inventory  which is charged to expense at time of purchase 
overall  the decrease in material costs was due to more effective spending controls related to engineering projects 
selling  general and administrative our selling expenses support domestic and international sales and marketing activities that include personnel  trade shows  advertising  third party sales representative commissions  and other selling and marketing activities 
our general and administrative expenses support our worldwide corporate  legal  tax  financial  governance  administrative  information systems and human resource functions in addition to our general management 
the increase in sg a expenses of million in as compared to was primarily driven by increases in sales personnel  commissions and travel expenses to meet the expectations and demands of our global customers  increased personnel costs related to the reversal of the temporary cost control efforts described earlier in this section  and the accrual of incentive compensation totaling million during as compared to no incentive compensation expense in we incurred million of transaction costs related to the acquisition of pv powered during as well as additional costs related to employees added 
table of contents through the acquisition 
we are aware of the growing needs of our customers during this period of revenue growth and we anticipate that sg a expenses will continue to increase in in terms of absolute dollars due to an expected increase in sales as well as a full year of employee costs related to our acquisition of pv powered 
in we will continue to closely scrutinize and monitor increases to our sg a expenses throughout the year and we anticipate that these costs will remain within their current range as a percentage of sales 
continued reduction of personnel related and other discretionary costs drove overall sg a costs lower by million in as compared to personnel costs decreased by million  purchased services decreased by million  and travel was reduced by million in as compared to  offset by a million increase in bad debt expense 
the increase in bad debt expense in was a result of certain customers deteriorating financial condition 
goodwill impairment charge we perform a goodwill impairment analysis using the two step method annually as of october and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
the recoverability of goodwill is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit  including goodwill  to its fair market value 
based upon a combination of factors in early  including a significant decline in our market capitalization below our carrying value  the deteriorating macro economic environment  which had resulted in a significant decline in customer demand  and illiquidity in the overall credit markets  we concluded that sufficient indicators existed to require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis at february  we determined our fair market value at february  based on our market capitalization and an average weighting of both projected discounted future cash flows and the use of comparative market multiples and relative control premiums 
the use of comparative market multiples the market approach uses other comparable companies valuation multiples to arrive at a fair value 
the use of discounted cash flows was based on assumptions that were consistent with our estimates of future growth and our strategic plan to manage the underlying business  and also included a probability weighted expectation as to our future cash flows 
factors requiring significant judgment include assumptions related to future growth rates  discount factors  and tax rates  along with other considerations 
having determined that our goodwill was potentially impaired  we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis which involved allocating the overall estimated fair value of the company to all of our assets and liabilities other than goodwill including both recognized and unrecognized intangible assets and comparing the residual amount to the carrying value of goodwill 
in march  we determined that our goodwill was fully impaired and recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million 
this charge eliminated the goodwill balance as of december  all goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  resulted from the acquisition of pv powered 
amortization expense amortization expense was million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the same period ending december  and million for the same period ending december  the increase of million in from is due to the acquisition of approximately million in amortizable assets with the purchase of pv powered 
it is estimated that amortization expense will continue to increase to approximately million in and will continue to increase in the foreseeable future 
see note intangible asset to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on intangible assets and related future amortization 

table of contents restructuring charges restructuring costs are related to actions taken in and primarily in response to downturns in our markets 
these costs were incurred to exit an activity or cancel an existing contractual obligation  including the closure of facilities and employee termination related charges 
we implemented cost reduction efforts in response to deteriorating economic conditions and weakening demand from our end markets 
as a result  we incurred restructuring costs of million in the costs incurred were primarily severance and benefits related to reductions in personnel 
we did not incur any restructuring costs in we continue to look for ways to make our global workforce more efficient and effective  which may lead to additional cost reduction activities in the future 
in  we recognized restructuring costs of million  of which million was associated with global cost reduction plans with respect to reductions in personnel implemented at various times throughout the year 
the remaining million of restructuring charges recognized in were a result of a plan to transition the production of a number of our legacy products from our manufacturing facility in fort collins  colorado to our manufacturing facility in shenzhen  prc 
this activity in led to the elimination of approximately positions on a worldwide basis 
other income  net other income expense  net consists primarily of interest income and expense  foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous items 
interest income for the twelve month period ending december   and has consistently decreased each year from million in to million in to million in as a result of much lower interest rates available in financial markets in and compared to and moving more dollars out of investments and into unrestricted cash over this three year period 
other income  net was million in  million in and a million loss in the increase in as compared to was mainly due to million in net revenue recognized in from pv powered s participation in the solar energy grid system program sponsored by the department of energy 
this was offset by a million decrease in interest income in resulting from lower interest rates 
provision for income taxes during  we were profitable in almost all the jurisdictions in which we operated 
as a result  we accrued income taxes at statutory rates that vary by location 
we recorded an income tax provision of million during the year ended december  the income tax provision consisted of million of tax on income in foreign jurisdictions and million of us federal and state income taxes 
in the second half of  we reconfigured our legal entity structure to realign our prc manufacturing operations with the intellectual property utilized in such manufacturing 
on december   we transferred the economic rights to our patents and know how between affiliates throughout the world  including our parent company 
as a result of this realignment  we generated million of taxable income during in the united states and japan and  thus  reversed a portion of our valuation allowance and utilized previously reserved deferred tax assets upon filing our tax return 
in  we recorded an income tax provision of million 
the provision was driven primarily by million of tax on income in foreign jurisdictions and million of federal income tax  which was comprised of million of tax expense related to reserves for uncertain tax positions  offset by million of federal benefit 
the remainder related to million benefit for state taxes 
our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors  such as tax legislation and the geographic composition of our pre tax income 
we carefully monitor these factors and timely adjust our effective income tax rate accordingly 

table of contents discontinued operations on october   we completed the sale of our gas flow control business  which includes the aera mass flow control and related product lines to hitachi metals  ltd  for million 
assets and liabilities sold include  without limitation  inventory  real property in hachioji  japan  equipment  certain contracts  intellectual property rights related to the gas flow control business and certain warranty liability obligations 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million gain on the asset disposition  net of million in taxes 
the results of continuing operations were reduced by the revenue and costs associated with the gas flow control business which are included in the income loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes  in our consolidated statements of operations 
segment reporting in fiscal the combination of pv powered s solar inverter product line with our solaron inverter product line resulted in revenue growth  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of our overall revenue 
serving the inverter market has proven to require management  marketing  sales and engineering efforts that are uniquely different from those of our traditional thin film capital equipment market 
as a result  management has announced the creation of two focused business units within the company effective january  the two business units  thin films deposition power conversion and thermal instrumentation thin films and renewable power inverters renewables  will enable improved execution and a strategic focus on two distinct markets 
the thin films business unit will principally serve our oem and end customers in the semiconductor  flat panel display  solar module and other capital equipment markets  while the renewables business unit will focus on residential  commercial and utility scale solar projects and installations  selling primarily to distributors  engineering  procurement  and construction contractors epc s  developers  and utility companies 
the creation of these two units will enable greater focus on each business unique needs and requirements  allowing each to expand and accelerate our growth by better serving each of these very different industries 
due to the structure of our internal organization  the design of our internal systems and the manner in which expenses were tracked and managed  we are unable to recast our financial statements by operating segment for and prior without significant cost and effort 
therefore  segment information based on the two new business units for  and has not been reported as it is impracticable to do so 

table of contents quarterly results of operations the following tables present unaudited quarterly results in dollars and as a percentage of sales for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december  we believe that all necessary adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly such quarterly information

however  we continuously monitor operating price increases  particularly in connection with the supply of component parts used in our manufacturing process 
to the extent permitted by competition  we pass increased costs on to our customers by increasing sales prices over time 
sales price increases  however  were not significant in any of the years presented herein 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity our ability to fund our operations  acquisitions  capital expenditures and product development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities which is subject to future operating performance as well as general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other conditions  some of which may be beyond our control 
our primary sources of liquidity are our available cash  investments and cash generated from current operations 
we have no line of credit or other external sources of liquidity 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk and risk management in the normal course of business  we have exposures to interest rate risk from our investments and foreign exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations and foreign currency transactions 
interest rate risk our market risk exposure relates to changes in interest rates in our investment portfolio 
we generally place our investments with high credit quality issuers and by policy are averse to principal loss and seek to protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
as of december   our investments consisted primarily of treasury bills  certificates of deposit  corporate bonds  agency bonds and institutional money markets  all with maturity of less than year 
as a measurement of the sensitivity of our portfolio and assuming that our investment portfolio balances remain constant  a hypothetical decrease of basis points in interest rates would decrease annual pre tax earnings by approximately million 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates through sales and purchasing transactions when we sell product and purchase materials in currencies different from the currency in which product and manufacturing costs were incurred 
the functional currencies of our worldwide facilities primarily include the usd  eur  kwn  ntd  gbp  and cny 
our purchasing and sales activities are primarily denominated in the usd  eur and cny 
we may be impacted by changes in the relative buying power of our customers  which may impact sales volumes either positively or negatively 
as these currencies fluctuate 
table of contents against each other  and other currencies  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on sales  purchasing transactions and labor 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency exchange rate contracts to hedge against changes in foreign currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities expected to be settled at a future date 
market risk arises from the potential adverse effects on the value of derivative instruments that result from a change in foreign currency exchange rates 
we did not execute foreign currency forward exchange rate contract transactions in or  but we may consider investing in such contracts during we minimize our market risk applicable to foreign currency exchange rate contracts by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of our derivative contract instruments 
we enter into derivative contract instruments for risk management purposes only 
we do not enter into or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
our reported financial results of operations  including the reported value of our assets and liabilities  are also impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
assets and liabilities of substantially all of our subsidiaries outside the us are translated at period end rates of exchange for each reporting period 
operating results and cash flow statements are translated at weighted average rates of exchange during each reporting period 
although these translation changes have no immediate cash impact  the translation changes may impact future borrowing capacity  and overall value of our net assets 
currency exchange rates vary daily and often one currency strengthens against the usd while another currency weakens 
because of the complex interrelationship of the worldwide supply chains and distribution channels  it is difficult to quantify the impact of a change in one or more particular exchange rates
