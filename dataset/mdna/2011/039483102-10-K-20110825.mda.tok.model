item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company overview this md a should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the company is principally engaged in procuring  transporting  storing  processing  and merchandising agricultural commodities and products 
the company uses its significant global asset base to originate and transport agricultural commodities  connecting to markets in more than countries 
the company also processes corn  oilseeds  wheat and cocoa into products for food  animal feed  chemical and energy uses 
the company uses its global asset network  business acumen  and its relationships with suppliers and customers to generate returns for our shareholders  principally from margins earned on these activities 
the company s operations are organized  managed and classified into three reportable business segments oilseeds processing  corn processing  and agricultural services 
each of these segments is organized based upon the nature of products and services offered 
the company s remaining operations  which include wheat processing  cocoa processing  and its financial business units  are not reportable segments  as defined by the applicable accounting standard  and are classified as other 
the oilseeds processing segment includes activities related to the origination  merchandising  crushing  and further processing of oilseeds such as soybeans and soft seeds cottonseed  sunflower seed  canola  rapeseed  and flaxseed into vegetable oils and protein meals 
oilseeds products produced and marketed by the company include ingredients for the food  feed  energy  and other industrial products industries 
crude vegetable oils produced by the segment s crushing activities are sold as is or are further processed by refining  blending  bleaching  and deodorizing into salad oils 
salad oils are sold as is or are further processed by hydrogenating and or interesterifying into margarine  shortening  and other food products 
partially refined oils are used to produce biodiesel or are sold to other manufacturers for use in chemicals  paints  and other industrial products 
oilseed protein meals are principally sold to third parties to be used as ingredients in commercial livestock and poultry feeds 
the oilseeds processing segment also produces natural health and nutrition products and other specialty food and feed ingredients 
in north america  cottonseed flour is produced and sold primarily to the pharmaceutical industry and cotton cellulose pulp is manufactured and sold to the chemical  paper  and filter markets 
in europe and south america  the oilseeds processing segment includes origination and merchandising activities of a network of grain elevators  port facilities  and transportation assets used to buy  store  clean  and transport agricultural commodities  as adjuncts to its oilseeds processing assets 
in south america  the oilseeds processing segment operates fertilizer blending facilities 
effective december   the company acquired alimenta usa inc  and as a result of the transaction  now owns of golden peanut  the leading us peanut sheller and oil refiner and operator of one peanut shelling facility in argentina 
the oilseeds processing segment began consolidating the operating results of golden peanut  its previously owned joint venture  in the third quarter of fiscal the oilseeds processing segment also includes the company s share of the results of its equity investment in wilmar and its share of results for its edible oils limited and stratas foods  llc joint ventures 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company s corn processing segment is engaged in corn wet milling and dry milling activities  with its asset base primarily located in the central part of the united states 
the corn processing segment converts corn into sweeteners and starches  and bioproducts 
its products include ingredients used in the food and beverage industry including sweeteners  starch  syrup  glucose  and dextrose 
dextrose and starch are used by the corn processing segment as feedstocks for its bioproducts operations 
by fermentation of dextrose  the corn processing segment produces alcohol  amino acids  and other specialty food and animal feed ingredients 
ethyl alcohol is produced by the company for industrial use as ethanol or as beverage grade 
ethanol  in gasoline  increases octane and is used as an extender and oxygenate 
bioproducts also include amino acids such as lysine and threonine that are vital compounds used in swine feeds to produce leaner animals and in poultry feeds to enhance the speed and efficiency of poultry production 
corn gluten feed and meal  as well as distillers grains  are produced for use as animal feed ingredients 
corn germ  a by product of the wet milling process  is further processed into vegetable oil and protein meal 
other corn processing products include citric and lactic acids  lactates  sorbitol  xanthan gum  and glycols which are used in various food and industrial products 
the corn processing segment includes the activities of the company s brazilian sugarcane operations  propylene and ethylene glycol facility  a bioplastic facility  and other equity investments in renewable plastics 
this segment includes the company s share of the results of its equity investments in almidones mexicanos sa  eaststarch sa  and red star yeast company llc 
the agricultural services segment utilizes its extensive us grain elevator and global transportation network to buy  store  clean  and transport agricultural commodities  such as oilseeds  corn  wheat  milo  oats  rice  and barley  and resells these commodities primarily as food and feed ingredients and as raw materials for the agricultural processing industry 
agricultural services grain sourcing and transportation network provides reliable and efficient services to the company s customers and agricultural processing operations 
agricultural services transportation network capabilities include truck  rail  barge  port  and ocean going vessel handling and freight services 
the agricultural services segment includes the activities of alfred c 
toepfer international  an owned global merchant of agricultural commodities and processed products 
the agricultural services segment also includes the company s share of the results of its kalama export company joint venture  activities related to the processing and distributing of formula feeds and animal health and nutrition products  and the procuring  processing  and distributing of edible beans 
other includes the company s remaining processing operations  consisting of activities related to processing agricultural commodities into food ingredient products such as wheat into wheat flour  and cocoa into chocolate and cocoa products 
other also includes financial activities related to banking  captive insurance  futures commission merchant activities  private equity fund investments  and the company s share of the results of its equity investment in gruma sab de sa corporate results principally include the impact of lifo related inventory adjustments  unallocated corporate expenses  unallocated net interest costs  and the after tax elimination of income attributable to mandatorily redeemable interests in consolidated subsidiaries 
operating performance indicators the company s oilseeds processing  agricultural services  and wheat processing operations are principally agricultural commodity based businesses where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commodity based agricultural raw materials 
therefore  changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both net sales and other operating income and cost of products sold 
thus  changes in margins and gross profit of these businesses do not necessarily correspond to the changes in net sales and other operating income amounts 
the company s corn processing operations and certain other food and animal feed processing operations also utilize agricultural commodities or products derived from agricultural commodities as raw materials 
in these operations  agricultural commodity market price changes can result in significant fluctuations in cost of products sold  and such price changes cannot necessarily be passed directly through to the selling price of the finished products 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company conducts its business in over countries 
for the majority of the company s subsidiaries located outside the united states  the local currency is the functional currency 
revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods 
for the majority of the company s business activities in brazil  the functional currency is the us dollar  however certain transactions  including taxes  occur in local currency and require conversion to the functional currency 
fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies  primarily the euro  british pound  canadian dollar  and brazilian real  as compared to the us dollar can result in corresponding fluctuations in the us dollar value of revenues and expenses reported by the company 
the company measures the performance of its business segments using key financial metrics such as segment operating profit  return on invested capital  and cost per metric ton 
the company s operating results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices  weather conditions  crop plantings  government programs and policies  changes in global demand resulting from population growth  general global economic conditions  changes in standards of living  and global production of similar and competitive crops 
due to these unpredictable factors  the company does not provide forward looking information in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
compared to as an agricultural commodity based business  the company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the company s operating results 
in  prices for certain agricultural commodities were higher in response to growing global demand and tighter crop supplies 
the projections of lower carryover stocks for certain key commodities  coupled with regional crop supply dislocations for certain commodities  also led to high commodity price volatility 
global demand for agricultural commodities grew in  resulting in increased sales volumes for most of the company s products 
the large north american harvest resulted in global merchandising  handling  and processing opportunities 
protein meal markets for commercial livestock producers in the us  particularly poultry producers  faced challenging conditions 
biodiesel markets in europe and south america  together with the extension of the us biodiesel blender s credit  helped support global demand for refined and crude vegetable oils 
sweeteners and starches demand remained strong in due primarily to us exports of sweeteners and improved demand for industrial starches 
ethanol sales volumes  including increased volumes as the company s new dry mills ramped up  were supported by favorable gasoline blending economics in the us and good export demand 
net earnings increased million to billion due principally to a million increase in segment operating profit partially offset by a negative impact from changing lifo inventory valuations and higher income taxes 
in  the company successfully managed through significant increases in market prices for most of its agricultural commodity raw materials  resulting in increased segment operating profit 
earnings before income taxes includes charges of million from the effect of increasing agricultural commodity prices on lifo inventory valuation reserves  compared to credits of million in the prior year caused by decreasing agricultural commodity prices 
income taxes increased million due to a higher effective income tax rate and higher earnings before income taxes 
the effective income tax rate of for was the result of changes in the geographic mix of earnings and unfavorable specific tax items 
the fully diluted earnings per share calculation for was impacted by the completion of the company s debt remarketing related to the billion equity units 
while the approximately million new common shares related to the billion equity units were not issued until june   the if converted method of accounting for diluted earnings per share required diluted eps to be calculated as if the company issued the shares on january   and this assumption resulted in a dilutive impact of on earnings per share see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued analysis of statements of earnings prior year net sales and other operating income by segment has been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation resulting in reclassified net sales and other operating income at the segment level with no impact to total net sales and other operating income or operating profit

net sales and other operating income increased billion due to higher average selling prices  primarily related to higher underlying commodity costs  and increased billion due to increased sales volumes  including sales volumes from acquisitions 
agricultural services sales increased to billion due to higher average selling prices of agricultural commodities and higher global sales volumes 
oilseeds processing sales increased to billion primarily due to higher average selling prices for vegetable oils  soybeans  biodiesel  and protein meal 
corn processing sales increased to billion due to higher average selling prices and increased sales volumes of ethanol and other corn products  in part due to the company s two new ethanol dry mills coming on line 
other sales increased to billion primarily due to higher average selling prices of cocoa and cocoa products and wheat flour  and increased sales volumes of cocoa and cocoa products 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued cost of products sold increased to billion due to higher costs of agricultural commodities  negative impacts resulting from changes in lifo inventory valuations  and higher manufacturing costs 
cost of products sold includes charges of million from the effect of increasing agricultural commodity prices on lifo inventory valuation reserves  compared to credits of million in the prior year caused by decreasing agricultural commodity prices 
manufacturing expenses increased million due primarily to higher processed volumes  including the volumes of the company s new greenfield operations coming on line  and higher average unit costs for certain chemicals and fuels used in the company s processing and transportation operations 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company updated its estimates for service lives of certain of its machinery and equipment assets 
this change in estimate resulted in a million decrease in depreciation expense compared to the amount of depreciation expense the company would have recorded using the previously estimated service lives 
manufacturing expenses included million in fiscal related to the start up of new plants compared to million in the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to billion 
this increase was due to higher employee related costs and higher administrative expenses 
higher employee related costs principally reflect the increase in number of employees during the year and included higher salaries and wages  higher accruals for performance based compensation and higher benefit expenses 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates declined to million 
the decline in earnings from the company s equity investee  wilmar  were partially offset by higher earnings of the company s equity investee  gruma  in part due to a gain on disposition of assets 
interest income increased to million principally resulting from higher interest earned on advances to affiliates 
interest expense increased to million 
interest costs capitalized as a component of major construction projects in progress was million compared to million in the prior year 
interest incurred on long term debt declined million as a result of debt retirements while interest incurred on short term debt increased million due to higher average borrowings driven by higher working capital requirements

crushing and origination results increased million to billion  which include the million gain on the revaluation of the company s equity interest in golden peanut as a result of the acquisition of the remaining interest 
improved north american crushing results  particularly for cotton seed and canola  were partially offset by lower crushing margins in south america and europe 
margins globally were enhanced by good positioning and by improved origination results 
in south america  fertilizer results improved due to higher margins and volumes 
refining  packaging  biodiesel and other results increased million to million due principally to higher packaged oils margins and improved north american and european biodiesel results 
asia results decreased million due principally to decreased earnings from the company s equity investee  wilmar 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued corn processing operating profit increased to billion  which includes favorable impacts from ownership positions  which were allocated to sweeteners and starches and bioproducts based on total grind 
sweeteners and starches operating profit decreased million to million due to higher net corn costs partially offset by higher sales volumes 
sales volumes increased due to us export shipments of sweeteners and improved us demand for industrial starches 
bioproducts operating profit improved million primarily due to higher ethanol sales volumes and higher average selling prices leading to increased ethanol and lysine margins 
bioproducts margins were also enhanced by favorable corn ownership positions 
bioproducts results included startup costs related to the company s new plants of million in the current year compared to million in the prior year 
agricultural services operating profit increased to million 
merchandising and handling results increased due to higher corn and wheat sales volumes and higher margins 
a large us harvest combined with strong international demand resulted in higher us export shipments 
merchandising and handling results this year include an insurance recovery of million related to property damage and business interruption resulting from an october explosion at the company s destrehan  louisiana export facility 
international merchandising results were weaker in part due to positions impacted by unexpected shifts in crop supply caused by weather conditions and government actions in the black sea region 
transportation results increased million to million primarily due to higher barge freight rates and higher barge utilization levels  in part due to higher us export volumes 
other operating profit increased to million 
other processing operating results improved in the company s wheat milling and cocoa business units due principally to increased equity earnings from the company s equity investee  gruma  which include a million gain related to the disposal of gruma assets 
other financial operating profit decreased million primarily due to higher captive insurance loss provisions principally related to a million loss related to the company s destrehan  louisiana export facility insurance claim 
corporate results decreased million primarily due to the negative impact from changing lifo inventory valuations and higher unallocated interest expense net 
the effects of changing commodity prices on lifo inventory reserves resulted in charges of million compared to credits of million for the prior year 
corporate unallocated interest expense increased million mostly due to lower capitalization of interest costs for construction projects in progress 
partially offsetting the higher lifo and unallocated interest costs were million of gains on interest rate swaps compared to prior year losses on interest rate swaps of million 
in addition  the prior year included charges of million on early debt extinguishment compared to million of similar charges in the current year 
compared to as an agricultural commodity based business  the company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the company s operating results 
market expectations throughout most of fiscal for fewer global crop supply and demand imbalances  coupled with continuing uncertainty about short term demand  led to generally lower and less volatile agricultural commodity market prices and conditions 
in addition  the late  extended us harvest reduced profit opportunities 
north american oilseed exports and us crushing volumes were enhanced in by the poor supply of crop year soybeans in south america 
increased government mandates for the use of biodiesel in south america and europe resulted in increased biodiesel demand and helped keep overall demand for refined and crude vegetable oil steady in these regions 
however  in north america  demand for vegetable oils remained weak in due to low consumption of oils in the food service and biodiesel industries  in part due to the expiration of the biodiesel blending credit in the us on january  soybean protein meal demand improved  particularly in asia 
market prices for corn decreased in resulting in lower raw material costs for corn processing and decreased average selling prices for sweeteners and starches 
lower energy  fuel and chemical costs per unit positively impacted the company s manufacturing costs 
more favorable ethanol blending economics together with increased ethanol merchandising activity resulted in increased demand  higher ethanol sales volumes  and improved margins 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued earnings before income taxes for include a credit of million from the effect of changing commodity prices on lifo inventory valuations  compared to a credit of million in income taxes decreased million due to a lower effective income tax rate  partially offset by higher pretax earnings
