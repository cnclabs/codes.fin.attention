sst s principal markets are in the building construction industry 
that industry is subject to significant volatility due to real estate market cycles  fluctuations in interest rates  the availability  or lack thereof  of credit to builders  developers and consumers  inflation rates  weather  and other factors and trends 
the world wide recession and the decline in residential construction that began in have reduced the demand for sst s products

business strategy simpson strong tie designs  manufactures and sells products that are of high quality and performance  easy to use and cost effective for customers 
sst provides rapid delivery of its products and prompt engineering and sales support 
based on its communications with customers  engineers  architects  contractors and other industry participants  sst believes that its products have strong brand name recognition  and sst seeks to continue to develop the value of its brand names through a variety of customer driven strategies 
information provided by customers has led to the development of many of sst s products  and sst expects that customer needs will continue to shape its product development  marketing and services 
specification in architects and engineers plans and drawings influences which products will be used for particular purposes and therefore is key to the use of sst s products in construction projects 
sst encourages architects and engineers to specify the installation of sst s products in projects they design and supervise  and encourages construction contractors to accept sst s products 
sst maintains frequent contacts with architects  engineers and contractors  as well as private organizations that provide information to building code officials  both to inform them regarding the quality  proper installation  capabilities and value of sst s products and to update them about product modifications and new products that may be useful or necessary 
sst sponsors seminars to inform architects  engineers  contractors and building officials on appropriate use and proper installation of its products 
additionally  sst maintains relationships with home builders to promote the use of its products 
sst seeks to expand its product and distribution coverage through several channels distributors 
sst regularly evaluates its distribution coverage and service levels provided by its distributors and from time to time modifies its distribution strategy and implements changes to address weaknesses and opportunities 
sst has various programs to evaluate distributor product mix and conducts promotions to encourage distributors to add sst products that complement the mix of product offerings in their markets 
through its efforts to increase specifications by architects and engineers  and through increasing the number of products sold to particular contractors  sst seeks to increase sales to channels that serve building contractors 
sst continuously seeks to expand the number of contractors served by each distributor through such sales efforts as demonstrations of product cost effectiveness and information programs 
home centers 
sst intends to increase penetration of the diy markets by solicitation of home centers and with increased product offerings 
sst s sales force maintains on going contact with home centers to work with them in a broad range of areas including inventory levels  retail display maintenance  and product knowledge training 
to satisfy specialized requirements of the home center market  sst has developed extensive bar coding and merchandising aids and has devoted a portion of its research efforts to the development of diy products 
dealers 
in some markets  sst sells its products directly to lumber dealers 
oem relationships 
sst works closely with manufacturers of engineered wood products and oems in developing and expanding the application and sales of its engineered wood connector and fastener products 
sst has relationships with several of the largest manufacturers of engineered wood products 
while sst is expanding its established facilities outside of california to increase its presence and sales in these markets  sales of some products may relate primarily to certain regions 
for example  sales of sst s line of shearwalls are concentrated mostly in the western region of the united states  because their use is primarily intended to resist the effects of seismic forces 
since sst has established operations in the united kingdom  opened manufacturing  warehouse and distribution facilities in western canada  and the midwest  northeast  and eastern seaboard regions of the united states  purchased anchor products manufacturers in illinois  eastern canada  france and ireland and connector product manufacturers in france  denmark  germany and canada  acquired the assets of a leading manufacturer and distributor of screw fastening systems and collated screws with manufacturing and distribution operations in tennessee and distribution in canada  europe  australia and new zealand  and acquired a german manufacturer with manufacturing in germany  czech republic and china  acquired a manufacturer and distributor of stainless steel fasteners with manufacturing in maryland and distribution in maryland  florida and massachusetts  built a manufacturing facility in china and opened sales offices in hong kong  beijing  shanghai and dubai for distribution in asia and the middle east  and acquired the business of a software company which licenses deck design and estimation software 
sst s european investments have established a presence in the european community through companies with existing customer bases and through servicing united states based customers operating in europe 
sst also distributes connector  anchor and epoxy products in mexico  australia  new zealand  asia and the middle east 
sst intends to continue to pursue and expand operations both inside and outside of the united states see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
an sst goal is to manufacture and warehouse its products in geographic proximity to its markets to provide availability and rapid delivery of products to customers and prompt response to customer requests for specially designed products and services 
with respect to the diy and dealer markets  sst s strategy is to keep the customer s retail stores continuously stocked with adequate supplies of the full line of sst s products that those stores carry 
sst manages its inventory to help assure continuous product availability 
most customer orders are filled within a few days 
high levels of manufacturing automation and flexibility allow sst to maintain its quality standards while continuing to provide prompt delivery 
the company s long term strategy is to develop  acquire or invest in product lines or businesses that have the potential to increase the company s earnings per share over time and that complement sst s existing product lines  can be marketed through sst s existing distribution channels  might benefit from use of sst s brand names and expertise  are responsive to needs of sst s customers  expand sst s markets geographically and reduce sst s dependence on the united states residential construction market 
products simpson strong tie is a recognized brand name in the markets it serves 
sst manufactures and markets products that strengthen the three types of connections typically found in residential and commercial construction wood to wood  wood to concrete and wood to masonry 
many of sst s connector products are installed in a continuous load path from the foundation to the roof system to tie the structure together 
sst also markets specialty screws and nails for proper installation of certain of its connector products 
these products have seismic  high wind  retrofit and remodeling applications for both new construction and diy markets 
through its anchor systems product line  sst offers a full line of adhesives  mechanical anchors  carbide drill bits and powder actuated pins and tools for numerous anchoring applications in concrete  masonry and steel in both standard and metric sizes 
sst also offers screw fastening systems and collated screws for various construction applications through the quik drive product line and a line of stainless steel fasteners 
most of sst s products are listed by recognized model building code agencies 
to achieve such listings  sst conducts extensive product testing  which is witnessed and certified by independent testing laboratories 
the tests also provide the basis for publication of load ratings for sst structural connectors  and this information is used by architects  engineers  contractors and homeowners 
the information is useful across the range of applications of sst s products  from the deck constructed by a homeowner to a multi story structure designed by an architect or engineer 
sst also manufactures connector products specifically designed for use with engineered wood products  such as wood i joists 
with increased timber costs and reduced availability of trees suitable for making traditional solid sawn lumber  construction with engineered wood products has increased substantially in the last several years 
sales of sst s engineered wood connector and fastener products have contributed significant revenues over the past several years 
metal connectors  anchors and fasteners will corrode and lose load carrying capacity when installed in corrosive environments or exposed to corrosive materials 
there are many environments and materials that may cause corrosion  including salt air  fire retardants  preservative treated wood  dissimilar metals  fumes and fertilizers 
the variables present in a single building environment make it impossible to predict accurately if  or when  significant corrosion will begin or reach a critical level 
this relative uncertainty makes it crucial that the specifiers be knowledgeable of the potential risks and select a product coating or metal that is suitable for the intended use 
changes in the preservative treated wood industry have created additional concerns 
effective december   the preservative treated wood industry voluntarily transitioned from chromated copper arsenate cca c used in residential applications to alternative treatments 
testing has shown that certain alternative replacement treatments are generally more corrosive than cca c 
sst publishes technical bulletins on subjects such as this and others that affect the installation and use of its products 
sst makes its technical bulletins available on its website at www 
strongtie 
com 
new product development sst commits substantial resources to new product development 
the majority of sst s products have been developed through its internal research and development program 
sst s research and development expense for the three years ended december   and  was   and  respectively 
sst is the only known united states manufacturer with the capability to test multi story wall systems  thus enabling testing rather than calculations alone to prove system performance 
sst engineering  sales  product management  and marketing teams work together with architects  engineers  building inspectors  code officials and customers in the new product development process 
sst s product research and development is based largely on needs that customers communicate to the company 
sst s strategy is to develop new products on a proprietary basis  to patent them when appropriate and to seek trade secret protection for others 
sst typically develops to new products each year 
for example  in  sst introduced several new fastener products  the strong drive structural wood screw for multi ply engineered wood and truss applications  a collated self drilling screw for fastening hardwood or exotic deck boards  an auto feed screw driving system for hex head screws with washers to fastener metal roofing or siding  and several other fasteners in bulk and collated forms for wood and composite decks  metal to metal fastening and general construction applications 
sst also developed new connector products in for truss applications  concrete anchorage and bolt installation  stainless steel products for highly corrosive environments  connectors for cold formed steel applications and general construction and diy products 
sst also redesigned several existing products to increase load capacity  ease installations or reduce installed cost 
within the north american markets  simpson anchor systems introduced its gas fired concrete nailing system  as well as its newly designed and code listed strong bolt ii product line 
while continuing to service the new single family residential housing market  sst has increased development efforts for products used in multi family residential markets and some light commercial and industrial markets  including cold formed steel construction 
distribution channels have been receptive to these new products 
sales and marketing simpson strong tie s sales and marketing programs are implemented through its branch system 
sst currently maintains branches in northern and southern california  texas  ohio  canada  england  france  germany  denmark and china 
each branch is served by its own sales force  as well as manufacturing  warehouse and office facilities 
each branch is responsible for a broad geographic area 
each is responsible for setting and executing sales and marketing strategies that are consistent with the markets that the branch serves and the goals of sst 
the north american branches closely integrate their manufacturing activities to enhance product availability 
branch sales forces in north america are supported by marketing managers in the home office in pleasanton  california 
the home office also coordinates issues affecting customers that operate in multiple regions 
the sales force maintains close working relationships with customers  develops new business  calls on architects  engineers and building officials and participates in a range of educational seminars 
sst sells its products through an extensive distribution system comprising dealer distributors supplying thousands of retail locations nationwide  contractor distributors  home centers  lumber dealers  manufacturers of engineered wood products  and specialized contractors such as roof framers 
in recent years  home centers have been one of sst s important distribution channels  and sst s sales to the home depot exceeded of the company s consolidated net sales in  and see item a risk factors  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
sst s diy and dealer products are used to build projects such as decks  patio covers and garage organization systems 
sst dedicates substantial resources to customer service 
sst produces numerous publications and point of sale marketing aids to serve specifiers  distributors  retailers and users for the various markets that it serves 
these publications include general catalogs  as well as various specific catalogs  such as those for its anchor system products 
the catalogs and publications describe the products and provide load and installation information 
sst also maintains several linked websites centered on www 
strongtie 
com  which include catalogs  product and technical information  code reports and other general information related to sst s product lines and promotional programs 
sst s engineers not only design and test products  but also provide engineering support for customers 
this support might range from the discussion of a load value in a catalog to testing the suitability of an existing product in a unique application 
sst s sales force communicates with customers in each of its marketing channels  through its publications  seminars and frequent sales calls 
based on its communications with customers  sst believes that its products are important to its customers businesses  and it is sst s policy to ship products within a few days of receiving the order  with many of the orders shipped the same day as the order is received 
many of sst s customers serve contractors that require rapid delivery of needed products 
home centers and dealers also require superior service because of fluctuating demand and to serve the needs of a broad base of customers 
to satisfy these requirements  sst maintains appropriate inventory levels  has redundant manufacturing capability and some multiple dies to produce the same parts 
sst also maintains information systems that provide sales and inventory control and forecasting capabilities throughout its network of factories and warehouses 
sst also has special programs for contractors intended to ensure the prompt manufacture and delivery of custom products 
simpson strong tie believes that dealer and home center sales of sst products are significantly greater when the bins and racks at dealer and home center locations are adequately stocked with appropriate products 
various retailers carry varying numbers of sst products 
sst s sales force is engaged in ongoing efforts to inform retailers about sst s merchandising programs and the appeal of the sst brand 
manufacturing process simpson strong tie designs and manufactures most of its standard products 
sst has concentrated on making its manufacturing processes as efficient as possible without compromising the quality or flexibility necessary to serve the needs of its customers 
sst has developed and uses automated manufacturing processes 
sst s innovative manufacturing systems and techniques have allowed it to control manufacturing costs  even while developing both new products and products that meet customized requirements and specifications 
sst s development of specialized manufacturing processes also has permitted increased operating flexibility and enhanced product design innovation 
as part of ongoing continuous improvement processes in its factories  sst s major north american manufacturing facilities initiated lean manufacturing practices to improve efficiency and customer service 
sst sources some products from third party vendors  both domestically and internationally 
sst is committed to helping people build safer structures economically through the design  engineering and manufacturing of structural connectors  pre fabricated shearwalls  anchors  fasteners and related products 
with the support and involvement of management  sst has developed a quality system that manages defined procedures to ensure consistent product quality and also meets the requirements of international code council icc product evaluation reports 
sst is recognized in its industry as a manufacturer of high quality products 
since  sst s quality system has been registered under iso  an internationally recognized set of quality assurance standards 
the company believes that iso registration is a valuable tool for maintaining its high quality standards 
as sst establishes new business locations through expansion or acquisitions  projects are established to integrate sst s quality systems and achieve iso registration 
in addition  sst has six testing laboratories accredited to iso standard  an internationally accepted standard that provides requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories 
most of sst s products are produced with a high level of automation  using progressive dies run in automatic presses making parts from coiled sheet steel at rates that often exceed strokes per minute 
sst estimates that it produces over million product pieces per year 
most of sst s products skus are bar coded with upc numbers for easy identification  and nearly all of the products sold to home centers are labeled with bar codes 
sst has significant press capacity and has multiple dies for some of its high volume products because of the need to produce these products close to the customer and to provide back up capacity 
the balance of production is accomplished through a combination of manual  blanking and numerically controlled nc processes that include robotic welders  lasers and turret punches 
this capability allows sst to produce products with little redesign or set up time  facilitating rapid turnaround for customers 
new tooling is also highly automated 
dies are designed and produced using computer aided design cad and computer aided machining cam systems 
cad cam capability enables sst to create multiple dies quickly and design them to high standards 
sst is constantly reviewing its product line to reduce manufacturing costs  increase automation  and take advantage of new types of materials 
sst also manufactures chemical anchoring products at its facilities in addison  illinois  and in cardet  france 
the chemicals are mixed in batches and are then loaded in two part dispensers 
these dispensers mix the product on the job site because set up times are usually very short 
in addition  sst purchases a number of products  primarily fasteners  powder actuated pins and tools and accessories and certain of its mechanical anchoring products  from various sources around the world 
these purchased products undergo inspections on a sample basis for conformance with ordered specifications and tolerances before being distributed 
regulation simpson strong tie s product lines are subject to federal  state  county  municipal and other governmental and quasi governmental regulations that affect product design  development  testing  applications  marketing  sales  installation and use 
most sst products are recognized by building code and standards agencies 
agencies that recognize sst products include the international code council evaluation service icc es  the international association of plumbing and mechanical officials iapmo  the city of los angeles  the state of florida  and california s division of the state architect 
these and other agencies adopt various testing and design standards and incorporate them into their related building codes 
with the adoption of the international residential code and the international building code  these standards are being applied more uniformly  and these codes are recognized throughout most of the united states 
sst considers code recognition to be a significant marketing tool and devotes considerable effort to obtaining and maintaining appropriate approvals for its products 
sst believes that architects  engineers  contractors and other customers are more likely to purchase structural products that have the appropriate code acceptance than competitive products that lack code acceptance 
sst actively participates in industry related professional associations to keep abreast of regulatory changes and to provide information to regulatory agencies 
competition simpson strong tie faces a variety of competition in all of the markets in which it participates 
this competition ranges from subsidiaries of large national or international corporations to small regional manufacturers 
while price is an important factor  sst competes on the basis of quality  breadth of product line  technical support  availability of inventory  service including custom design and manufacturing  field support and product innovation 
as a result of differences in structural design and building practices and codes  sst s markets tend to differ by region 
within these regions  sst competes with companies of varying size  several of which also distribute their products nationally or internationally 
raw materials the principal raw material used by simpson strong tie is steel  including stainless steel 
sst generally orders steel to specific american society of testing and materials astm standards 
sst also uses materials such as epoxies and acrylics in the manufacture of its chemical anchoring products 
sst purchases raw materials from a variety of commercial sources 
sst s practice is to seek cost savings and enhanced quality by purchasing from a limited number of suppliers 
the steel industry is highly cyclical and prices for sst s raw materials are influenced by numerous factors beyond sst s control  including general economic conditions  competition  labor costs  foreign exchange rates  import duties  raw material shortages and trade restrictions 
the steel market continues to be dynamic  with a high degree of uncertainty about future pricing trends 
steel prices increased from their levels in mid  as steel mills have been raising prices as demand returns to global steel markets 
sst expects steel prices to remain at current levels or to increase throughout numerous factors may cause steel prices to increase in the future 
in addition to increases in steel prices  mills have added surcharges for zinc  energy and freight in response to increases in their costs 
these and other factors could adversely affect sst s cost and access to steel in if steel prices increase and sst is not able to maintain its prices or increase them sufficiently  sst s margins could deteriorate 
see item a risk factors and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company historically has not attempted to hedge against changes in prices of steel or other raw materials 
patents and proprietary rights simpson strong tie has united states and foreign patents  the majority of which cover products that sst currently manufactures and markets 
these patents  and applications for new patents  cover various design aspects of sst s products  as well as processes used in their manufacture 
sst continues to develop new potentially patentable products  product enhancements and product designs 
although sst does not intend to apply for additional foreign patents covering existing products  sst has developed an international patent program to protect new products that it may develop 
in addition to seeking patent protection  sst relies on unpatented proprietary technology to maintain its competitive position 
see item a risk factors 
acquisitions and expansion into new markets the company s future growth  if any  may depend to some extent on its ability to penetrate new markets  both domestically and internationally 
see industry and market trends and business strategy 
therefore  the company may in the future pursue acquisitions of product lines or businesses 
see item a risk factors and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

seasonality and cyclicality simpson strong tie s sales are seasonal and cyclical 
operating results vary from quarter to quarter and with economic cycles 
sst s sales are also dependent  to a large degree  on the north american residential home construction industry 
see item a risk factors and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
environmental  health and safety matters the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations governing emissions into the air  discharges into water  and generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste materials 
the company is also subject to other federal and state laws and regulations regarding health and safety matters

risk factors 
you should carefully consider the following risks before you decide to buy or hold shares of our common stock 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  results of operations or financial condition would likely suffer 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our stock 
this and other public reports may contain forward looking statements based on current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections about us and our industry 
those forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those forward looking statements as a result of many factors  as more fully described below and elsewhere in our public reports 
we do not undertake to update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
worldwide economic conditions and credit tightening materially and adversely affect our business 
our business has been materially and adversely affected by changes in regional  national or global economic conditions 
such changes have included or may include reduced consumer spending  reduced availability of capital  inflation  deflation  adverse changes in interest rates  reduced energy availability and increased energy costs  and government initiatives to manage economic conditions 
continuing instability in financial markets and the deterioration of other national and global economic conditions may have further materially adverse effects on our operations  financial results or liquidity  including the following the financial stability of our customers or suppliers may be compromised  which could result in additional bad debts for us or non performance by suppliers  financial instability of the financial institutions where we have our cash balances invested could result in loss of our principal balance  one or more of the financial institutions that make available our revolving credit facility may become unable to fulfill their funding obligations  which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity  it may become even more costly or difficult for us to obtain the agreed or additional financing or to refinance our existing credit facility  or our assets may be impaired or subject to write down or write off 
uncertainty about current global economic conditions may cause consumers of our products to postpone or refrain from spending in response to tighter credit  negative financial news  declines in income or asset values  or other adverse economic events or conditions  which could materially reduce demand for our products and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
further deterioration of economic conditions would likely exacerbate these adverse effects  result in wide ranging  adverse and prolonged effects on general business conditions  and materially and adversely affect our operations  financial results and liquidity 
failure to comply with industry regulations could result in reduced sales and increased costs 
the design  capacity and quality of most of our products and manufacturing processes are subject to numerous and extensive regulations and standards promulgated by governmental  quasi governmental and industry organizations 
these regulations and standards are highly technical  complex and subject to frequent revision 
if our products or manufacturing processes fail to comply with any regulations or standards  we may not be able to manufacture and market our products profitably 
failure to comply with regulations and standards could therefore materially reduce our sales and increase our costs 
if we fail to compete effectively  our revenue and profit margins could decline 
we face a variety of competition in all of the markets in which we participate 
many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do 
in addition  other technologies may be the bases for competitive products that could render our products obsolete or noncompetitive 
other companies may find our markets attractive and enter those markets 
competitive pricing  including price competition or the introduction of new products  could have material adverse effects on our revenues and profit margins 
our ability to compete effectively depends to a significant extent on the specification or approval of our products by architects  engineers  building inspectors  building code officials and customers 
if a significant segment of those communities were to decide that the design  materials  manufacturing  testing or quality control of our products is inferior to that of any of our competitors  our sales and profits would be materially reduced 
if we lose all or part of a large customer  our sales and profits would decline 
we have substantial sales to a few large customers 
loss of all or part of our sales to a large customer would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profits 
our largest customer accounted for and of net sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
this customer may endeavor to replace  in some or all markets  our products with lower priced products supplied by others or may otherwise reduce its purchases of our products 
we also might reduce our dependence on our largest customer by reducing or terminating sales to one or more of the customer s subsidiaries 
any reduction in  or termination of  our sales to this customer would at least temporarily  and possibly longer  cause a material reduction in our net sales  income from operations and net income 
a reduction in or elimination of our sales to our largest customer  or another of our larger customers  would increase our relative dependence on our remaining large customers 
in addition  our customers include retailers and distributors 
retail and distribution businesses have consolidated over time  which could increase the material adverse effect of losing any of them 
increases in prices of raw materials could negatively affect our sales and profits 
our principal raw material is steel  including stainless steel 
the steel industry is highly cyclical 
numerous factors beyond our control  such as general economic conditions  competition  worldwide demand  material and labor costs  energy costs  foreign exchange rates  import duties and other trade restrictions  influence prices for our raw materials 
consolidation among domestic integrated steel producers  changes in supply and demand in steel markets  changes in foreign currency exchange rates and economic conditions  and other events have led to volatility in steel costs 
the domestic steel market is heavily influenced by three major united states manufacturers 
we have not always been able  and in the future we might not be able  to increase our product prices in amounts that correspond to increases in costs of raw materials  without materially and adversely affecting our sales and profits 
we have not attempted to hedge against changes in prices of steel or other raw materials 
in recent years  however  we have increased our steel purchases in an effort to mitigate the effects of rising steel prices 
at the same time  since our sales have declined with the declines in the housing and financial markets 
as a result  our inventory fluctuated substantially 
inventory fluctuation can materially and adversely affect our margins  cash flow and profits 
if we cannot protect our technology  we will not be able to compete effectively 
our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology  in part through patents 
we might not be able to protect or rely on our patents 
patents might not issue pursuant to pending patent applications 
others might independently develop the same or similar technology  develop around the patented aspects of any of our products or proposed products  or otherwise obtain access to or circumvent our proprietary technology 
we also rely on unpatented proprietary technology to maintain our competitive position 
we might not be able to protect our know how or other proprietary information 
if we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our significant products  our sales and profits could be materially reduced 
in attempting to protect our proprietary information  we sometimes initiate lawsuits against competitors and others that we believe have infringed or are infringing our rights 
in such an event  the defendant may assert counterclaims to complicate or delay the litigation or for other reasons 
litigation may be very costly and may result in adverse judgments that affect our sales and profits materially and adversely 
integrating acquired businesses may divert management s attention away from our day to day operations 
we may pursue acquisitions of product lines or businesses 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including  for example difficulties assimilating the operations and products of acquired businesses  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  overvaluation of acquired businesses  undisclosed existing or potential liabilities of acquired businesses  slow acceptance or rejection of acquired businesses products by our customers  risks of entering markets in which we have little or no prior experience  litigation involving activities  properties or products of acquired businesses  consumer and other claims related to products of acquired businesses  and the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses 
in addition  future acquisitions may cause us to issue additional equity securities that dilute the value of our existing equity securities  increase our debt  and cause impairment and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could materially and adversely affect our profitability 
any acquisition could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
significant costs to integrate our acquired operations may negatively affect our financial condition and the market price of our stock 
we will incur costs from integrating acquired business operations  products and personnel 
these costs may be significant and may include expenses and other liabilities for employee redeployment  relocation or severance  combining teams and processes in various functional areas  reorganization or closures of facilities  and relocation or disposition of excess equipment 
the integration costs that we incur may negatively affect our profitability and the market price of our stock 
our future growth may depend on our ability to penetrate new domestic and international markets  which could reduce our profitability 
international construction customs  standards  techniques and methods differ from those in the united states 
laws and regulations applicable in new markets may be unfamiliar to us 
compliance may be substantially more costly than we anticipate 
as a result  we may need to redesign products  or invent or design new products  to compete effectively and profitably in new markets 
we expect that we will need significant time  which may be years  to generate substantial sales or profits in new markets 
other significant challenges to conducting business in foreign countries include  among other factors  local acceptance of our products  political instability  changes in import and export regulations  changes in tariff and freight rates  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and currency controls 
we might not be able to penetrate these markets and any market penetration that occurs might not be timely or profitable 
if we do not penetrate these markets within a reasonable time  we will be unable to recoup part or all of the significant investments we will have made in attempting to do so 
seasons and business cycles affect our operating results 
our sales are seasonal  with operating results varying from quarter to quarter 
with some exceptions  our sales and income have historically been lower in the first and fourth quarters than in the second and third quarters of the year  as customers purchase construction materials in the late spring and summer months for the construction season 
in addition  weather conditions  such as unseasonably warm  cold or wet weather  which affect  and sometimes delay or accelerate  installation of some of our products  significantly affect our results of operations 
political and economic events can also affect our sales and profitability 
we have little control over the timing of customer purchases 
sales that we anticipate in one quarter may occur in another quarter  affecting both quarters results 
in addition  we incur significant expenses as we develop  produce and market our products in anticipation of future orders 
we maintain high inventory levels and typically ship orders as we receive them  so we operate with little backlog 
as a result  net sales in any quarter generally depend on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
a significant portion of our operating expenses is fixed 
planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts 
when sales do not meet our expectations  our operating results will be reduced for the relevant quarters  as we will have already incurred expenses based on those expectations 
our principal markets are in the building construction industry 
that industry is subject to significant volatility due to real estate market cycles  fluctuations in interest rates  the availability  or lack thereof  of credit to builders and developers  inflation rates  weather  and other factors and trends 
none of these factors or trends is within our control 
declines in commercial and residential construction  such as housing starts  and remodeling projects have reduced  and in the future can be expected to reduce  the demand for our products 
negative economic or construction industry performance adversely affects our business 
declines in construction activity or demand for our products have materially and adversely affected  and could in the future materially and adversely affect  our sales and profitability 
product liability claims and product recalls could harm our reputation  sales and financial condition 
we design and manufacture most of our standard products and expect to continue to do so  although we buy raw materials and some manufactured products from others 
we have on occasion found flaws and deficiencies in the manufacturing  design or testing of our products 
we also have on occasion found flaws and deficiencies in raw materials and finished goods produced by others 
some flaws and deficiencies have not been apparent until after the products were installed by customers 
many of our products are integral to the structural soundness or safety of the structures in which they are used 
if any flaws or deficiencies exist in our products and if such flaws or deficiencies are not discovered and corrected before our products are incorporated into structures  the structures could be unsafe or could suffer severe damage  such as collapse or fire  and personal injury could result 
errors in the installation of our products  even if the products are free of flaws and deficiencies  could also cause personal injury and unsafe structural conditions 
to the extent that such damage or injury is not covered by our product liability insurance and we are held to be liable  we could be required to correct such damage and to compensate persons who might have suffered injury  and our reputation  business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
even if a flaw or deficiency is discovered before any damage or injury occurs  we may need to recall products  and we may be liable for any costs necessary to replace recalled products or retrofit the affected structures 
any such recall or retrofit could entail substantial costs and adversely affect our reputation  sales and financial condition 
we do not carry insurance against recall costs or the adverse business effect of a recall  and our product liability insurance may not cover retrofit costs 
claims resulting from a natural disaster might be made against us with regard to damage or destruction of structures incorporating our products 
any such claims  if asserted  could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition 
complying or failing to comply with environmental  health and safety laws and regulations could affect us materially and adversely 
we are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing emissions into the air  discharges into water  and generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste materials 
we are also subject to other federal and state laws and regulations regarding health and safety matters 
our manufacturing operations involve the use of solvents  chemicals  oils and other materials that are regarded as hazardous or toxic 
we also use complex and heavy machinery and equipment that can pose severe safety hazards  especially if not properly and carefully used 
some of our products also incorporate materials that are hazardous or toxic in some forms  such as zinc and lead used in some steel galvanizing processes and chemicals used in our acrylic and epoxy anchoring products 
the gun powder used in our powder actuated tools is explosive 
misuse of other materials in some of our products could also cause injury or sickness 
if we do not obtain all material licenses and permits required by environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  we may be subject to regulatory action by governmental authorities 
if our policies and procedures do not comply in all respects with existing environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  our activities might violate such laws and regulations 
even if our policies and procedures do comply  but our employees fail or neglect to follow them in all respects  we might incur similar liability 
relevant laws and regulations could change or new ones could be adopted that require us to obtain additional licenses and permits and cause us to incur substantial expense 
our generation  handling  use  storage  transportation  treatment or disposal of hazardous or toxic materials  machinery and equipment might cause injury to persons or to the environment 
we may need to take remedial action if properties that we occupy are contaminated by hazardous or toxic substances 
any change in laws or regulations  any legal or regulatory violations  or any contamination  could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition 
we depend on key management and technical personnel  the loss of whom could harm our business 
we depend on certain key management and technical personnel  including  among others  thomas j fitzmyers  michael j 
herbert  phillip terry kingsfather  barclay simpson  karen colonias and jeffrey e 
mackenzie 
the loss of one or more key employees could materially and adversely affect us 
our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified technical  marketing and management personnel necessary for the maintenance and expansion of our activities 
we face strong competition for such personnel 
we might not be able to attract or retain such personnel 
in addition  when we experience periods with little or no profits  a decrease in compensation based on our profits may make it difficult to attract and retain highly qualified personnel 
any work stoppage or interruption by employees could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition 
a significant number of our employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements that will expire in and a work stoppage or interruption by a significant number of our employees could have a material and adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
international operations expose us to foreign exchange rate risk 
we have foreign exchange rate risk in our international operations and through purchases from foreign vendors 
we do not currently hedge this risk 
changes in currency exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our sales and profitability 
natural disasters could decrease our manufacturing capacity 
most of our current and planned manufacturing facilities are located in geographic regions that have experienced major natural disasters  such as earthquakes  floods and hurricanes 
for example  the earthquakes in northridge  california  in january  destroyed several freeways and numerous buildings in the region in which our facilities in brea are located 
our disaster recovery plan may not be adequate or effective 
we do not carry earthquake insurance 
other insurance that we carry is limited in the risks covered and the amount of coverage 
our insurance would not be adequate to cover all of our resulting costs  business interruption and lost profits when a major natural disaster occurs 
a natural disaster rendering one or more of our manufacturing facilities totally or partially unusable  whether or not covered by insurance  would materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition 
control by our principal stockholder reduces the ability of other stockholders to influence management 
barclay simpson  the chairman of our board of directors  controls approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
mr 
simpson and thomas j fitzmyers  our president and chief executive officer even though he owns less than of the outstanding shares of our common stock  have significant influence with respect to the election of our directors and over some fundamental changes affecting us  such as a merger or sale of assets or amendment of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws 
additional financing  if needed  to fund our working capital  growth or acquisitions may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
if our cash requirements for working capital or to fund our growth increase to a level that exceeds the amount of cash that we generate from operations  or if we should decide to make an acquisition that requires more cash than we have available internally and through our current credit arrangements  we will need to seek additional resources 
in that event  we may need to enter into additional or new borrowing arrangements or consider equity financing 
additional or new borrowings may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  especially under current conditions in the financial markets 
our ability to raise money by selling and issuing shares of our common or preferred stock would depend on general market conditions and the demand for our stock 
we may be unable to raise adequate capital on reasonable terms by selling stock 
if we sell stock  our existing stockholders could experience substantial dilution 
our inability to secure additional financing could prevent the expansion of our business  internally and through acquisitions 
any issuance of preferred stock may dilute your investment and reduce funds available for dividends 
our board of directors is authorized by our certificate of incorporation to determine the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and to authorize the issuance of shares of any such series on such terms as our board of directors may approve 
any such issuance could be used to impede an acquisition of our business that our board of directors does not approve  further dilute the equity investments of holders of our common stock and reduce funds available for the payment of dividends to holders of our common stock 
our stock price is likely to be volatile and could drop 
the trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to period to period variations in operating results  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  general conditions in the construction and construction materials industries  relatively low trading volume in our common stock and other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market is subject to extreme price fluctuations 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of those companies 
securities market fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
future sales of common stock could adversely affect our stock price 
our issuance of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock 
all of the outstanding shares of our common stock are freely tradable without restriction under the securities act of  other than million shares held as of february  by our affiliates  as that term is defined in rule under the securities act of options to purchase million shares of our common stock were outstanding as of december   including options to purchase million shares that were exercisable 
if a substantial number of shares were sold in the public market pursuant to rule or on exercise of options  the trading price of our common stock in the public market could be adversely affected 
delaware law and our stockholder rights plan contain anti takeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts that might otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
section of the delaware general corporation law may make the acquisition of simpson manufacturing co  inc and the removal of incumbent officers and directors more difficult by prohibiting stockholders holding or more of our outstanding voting stock from acquiring simpson manufacturing co  inc without the consent of our board of directors for at least three years from the date they first hold or more of the voting stock 
barclay simpson and his affiliates are not subject to this provision of delaware law with respect to their investment in simpson manufacturing co  inc in addition  our stockholder rights plan has significant anti takeover effects by causing substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors 
we are subject to a number of significant risks that might cause our actual results to vary materially from our plans  targets or projections  including lack of market acceptance of new products  failing to develop new products with significant market potential  increased labor costs  including significant increases in worker s compensation insurance premiums and health care benefits  failing to increase  or even maintain  sales and profits  failing to anticipate  appropriately invest in and effectively manage the human  information technology and logistical resources necessary to support the growth of our business  including managing the costs associated with such resources  failing to integrate  leverage and generate expected rates of return on investments  including expansion of existing businesses and expansion through acquisitions  failing to generate sufficient future positive operating cash flows and  if necessary  secure adequate external financing to fund our growth  and interruptions in service by common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels 
if we change significantly the location  nature or extent of some of our manufacturing operations  we may reduce our net income 
if we decide to change significantly the location  nature or extent of a portion of our manufacturing operations  we may need to record an impairment of our goodwill 
our goodwill totaled million at december  recording an impairment of our goodwill correspondingly reduces our net income 
in  for example  we decided to move part of our canadian manufacturing operations to china in or  and as a result  we recorded a goodwill impairment of million  which materially reduced our net income in other changes or events in the future could further impair our recorded goodwill  which could also materially and adversely affect our profitability 
impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
we are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill and other intangible assets annually or at any time when events occur that could affect the value of such assets 
to determine whether a goodwill impairment has occurred  we compare fair value of each of our reporting units with its carrying value 
significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances  such as significant adverse changes in business climate  adverse actions by regulatory authorities  unanticipated competition  loss of key customers or changes in technology or markets  can require a charge for impairment that can materially and adversely affect our reported net income and our stockholders equity 
for example  in  our annual impairment test resulted in goodwill impairment charge of million associated with assets acquired in germany and ireland in as part of our european anchor reporting unit 
this reporting unit s carrying value exceeded its fair value  primarily due to reduced future expected net cash flows 
if current adverse conditions in the home building industry  the financial markets or the economy generally should continue longer than we expect  we may need to take further charges for impairment  which we are not now able to estimate  but which may be substantial 
failure of our internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results 
our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting 
internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions  providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of the consolidated financial statements  providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of our assets are made in accordance with management authorization  and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition  use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
because of the inherent limitations of internal control  our internal control over financial reporting might not detect or prevent misstatement of our consolidated financial statements 
our growth and entry into new  globally dispersed markets puts significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting 
failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud 
failure of our accounting systems could harm our business and financial results 
we have implemented a new commercially available microsoft third party accounting software system  initially focused on replacing our internally developed general ledger and purchasing and payables systems  for use in our operations in the united states  europe and asia 
any errors or defects in  or unavailability of  third party software or our implementation of the systems  could result in errors in our financial statements  which could materially and adversely affect our business 
if we continue to use our other internally developed accounting systems and they are not able to accommodate our future business needs  or if we find that they or any new systems we may implement contain errors or defects  our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
our international operations may be materially and adversely affected by factors beyond our control 
economic  social and political conditions  laws  practices and customs vary widely among the countries where we produce or sell our products 
our operations outside of the united states are subject to a number of risks and potential costs  including  for example  lower profit margins  less protection of intellectual property and economic  political and social uncertainty in some countries  especially in china and other emerging markets 
our sales and profits depend  in part  on our ability to develop and implement policies and strategies that effectively anticipate and manage these and other risks in the countries where we do business 
these and other risks may have a material adverse effect on our operations in any particular country and on our business as a whole 
inflation in emerging markets also makes our products more expensive there and increases the market and credit risks to which we are exposed 
our international operations depend on our successful management of our subsidiaries outside of the united states 
we conduct most of our international business through wholly owned subsidiaries 
managing distant subsidiaries and fully integrating them into our business is challenging 
we cannot directly supervise every aspect of the operations of our subsidiaries operating outside the united states 
as a result  we rely on local managers and staff 
cultural factors and language differences can result in misunderstandings among internationally dispersed personnel 
the risk that unauthorized conduct may go undetected may be greater in subsidiaries outside of the united states 
these problems could adversely affect our sales and profits 
our manufacturing facilities in china complicate our inventory management 
we maintain manufacturing capability in various parts of the world  in part to allow us to serve our customers with prompt delivery of needed products 
such customer service is a significant factor in our efforts to compete with larger companies that have greater resources than we have 
we have expanded  substantially  our manufacturing in china 
much of the output of our manufacturing in china is and will be intended for export to other parts of asia and elsewhere 
because of the unusually great distances between our manufacturing facilities in china and the markets to which the products made there will be shipped  we may have difficulty providing adequate service to our customers  which may put us at a competitive disadvantage 
our attempts to provide prompt delivery may necessitate that in china we produce and keep on hand substantially more inventory of finished products than would otherwise be needed 
inventory fluctuations can materially and adversely affect our margins  cash flow and profits 
if we fail to keep pace with advances in our industry or fail to persuade customers to adopt new products we introduce  customers may not buy our products  which would adversely affect our sales and profits 
constant development of new technologies and techniques  frequent new product introductions and strong price competition characterize the construction industry 
the first company to introduce a new product or technique to the market gains a competitive advantage 
our future growth depends  in part  on our ability to develop products that are more effective  safer  or incorporate emerging technologies better than our competitors products 
sales of our existing products may decline rapidly if a competitor were to introduce superior products  or even if we announce a new product of our own 
if we fail to make sufficient investments in research and development or if we focus on technologies that do not lead to better products  our current and planned products could be surpassed by more effective or advanced products 
if we fail to manufacture our products economically and market them successfully  our sales and profits would be materially and adversely affected 
changes in accounting standards could materially and adversely affect our financial results 
the accounting rules applicable to public companies are subject to frequent revision 
future changes in accounting standards  guidance and interpretations could require us to change the way we measure revenue  expense or balance sheet amounts  which could result in material and adverse change to our reported results of operations or financial condition 
climate change could materially and adversely affect our business 
scientific reports indicate that  as a result of human activity temperatures around the world have been increasing and are likely to continue to increase as a result of increasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other carbon compounds  the frequency and severity of storms and flooding are likely to increase  severe weather is likely to occur in places where the climate has historically been more mild  and average sea levels have risen and are likely to rise more  threatening worldwide coastal development 
we cannot predict the effects that these phenomena may have on our business 
they might  for example depress or reverse economic development  reduce the demand for construction  increase the cost and reduce the availability of fresh water  destroy forests  increasing the cost and reducing the availability of wood products used in construction  increase the cost and reduce the availability of raw materials and energy  increase the cost of capital  increase the cost and reduce the availability of insurance covering damage from natural disasters  lead to claims regarding the content or adequacy of our public disclosures  and lead to new laws and regulations that increase our expenses and reduce our sales 
any of these consequences  and other consequences of climate change that we do not foresee  could materially and adversely affect our sales  profits and financial condition 
we are subject to us and international tax laws that could affect our financial results 
we conduct international operations through our subsidiaries 
tax laws affecting international operations are complex and subject to change 
our income tax liabilities in the different countries where we operate depend in part on internal settlement prices and administrative charges among us and our subsidiaries 
these arrangements require us to make judgments with which tax authorities may disagree 
tax authorities may impose additional tariffs  duties  taxes  penalties and interest on us 
for example  we manufacture steel products in foreign countries for importation into the us and other countries  and government agencies may impose substantial prospective or retroactive tariffs on such products 
transactions that we have arranged in light of current tax rules could have material and adverse consequences if tax rules change  and changes in tax rules or imposition of any new or increased tariffs  duties and taxes could materially and adversely affect our sales  profits and financial condition 
contracts that we file as exhibits to our public reports contain recitals  representations and warranties that may not be factually correct 
the parties to any agreement or other instrument that we file as an exhibit to this or any other report did not necessarily intend that any recital  representation  warranty or other statement of purported fact in the instrument establishes or confirms any fact  even if it is worded as such 
the parties generally intended such statements to allocate contractual risk between the parties  and the statements often are subject to standards of materiality that differ from the standards applicable to our reports 
in addition  such statements may have been qualified by other materials that we have not filed with or incorporated by reference into this or any other report or document 
such exhibits should be read in the context of our other disclosures in our reports 
we believe the text of each of our reports was complete and correct in all material respects when we filed it 
if we are unable to protect our information systems against data corruption  cyber based attacks or network security breaches  our operations could be disrupted 
we depend on information technology networks and systems  including the internet  to process  transmit and store electronic information 
we depend on our information technology infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations around the world and between our personnel and our subsidiaries  customers and suppliers 
security breaches of this infrastructure could create system disruptions  shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information 
security breaches could disrupt our operations  and we could suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information

hawaii case 
hawaii case was filed on november  hawaii cases and were originally filed on june  hawaii case was filed on august  the hawaii cases all relate to alleged premature corrosion of the company s strap tie holdown products installed in buildings in a housing development known as ocean pointe in honolulu  hawaii  allegedly causing property damage 
hawaii case is a putative class action brought by the owners of allegedly affected ocean pointe houses 
hawaii case was originally filed as kai et al 
v 
haseko homes  inc  haseko construction  inc 
and simpson manufacturing  inc  case no 
 but was voluntarily dismissed and then re filed with a new representative plaintiff 
hawaii case is an action by the builders and developers of ocean pointe against the company  claiming that either the company s strap tie holdowns are defective in design or manufacture or the company failed to provide adequate warnings regarding the products susceptibility to corrosion in certain environments 
hawaii case is a subrogation action brought by the insurance company for the builders and developers against the company claiming the insurance company expended funds to correct problems allegedly caused by the company s products 
hawaii case  like hawaii case  is a putative class action brought by owners of allegedly affected ocean pointe homes 
in hawaii case  haseko homes  inc haseko  the developer of the ocean pointe development  has brought a third party complaint against the company alleging that any damages for which haseko may be liable are actually the fault of the company 
none of the hawaii cases alleges a specific amount of damages sought  although each of the hawaii cases seeks compensatory damages  and hawaii case seeks punitive damages 
the company is currently investigating the facts underlying the claims asserted in the hawaii cases  including  among other things  the cause of the alleged corrosion  the severity of any problems shown to exist  the buildings affected  the responsibility of the general contractor  various subcontractors and other construction professionals for the alleged damages  the amount  if any  of damages suffered  and the costs of repair  if needed 
at this time  the likelihood that the company will be found liable for any property damage allegedly suffered and the extent of such liability  if any  are unknown 
based on facts currently known to the company  the company believes that all or part of the claims alleged in the hawaii cases may be covered by its insurance policies 
the company intends to defend itself vigorously in connection with the hawaii cases

actual results might differ materially from results suggested by any forward looking statements in this report 
the company does not have an obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of the receipt of new information  the occurrence of future events or otherwise 
the following is a discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of continuing operations  unless stated otherwise  for the company for the years ended december   and  and of certain factors that may affect the company s prospective financial condition and results of operations 
the following should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere herein 
overview the company s net sales decreased to million in from million in  reflecting slower homebuilding activity 
net sales decreased in from in all regions of the united states  with above average rates of decline in california and the western and southwestern portions of the country  and net sales to home centers decreased significantly over the same period 
sales decreased in europe  while showing increases in canada  asia and australia over the same period 
although sales in europe have decreased from to  expansion has partly offset the decrease  due in part to the acquisitions of certain assets of liebig international ltd  an irish company  heinrich liebig stahld belwerke gmbh  liebig gmbh co

in recent years  home center sales have declined  although at a lower rate than the company s consolidated net sales 
a large part of the home center sales was sales to the home depot  which exceeded of the company s consolidated net sales in the years ended december    and see item a risk factors and note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
consolidation of retailers and distributors has occurred over time 
while the consolidation of these large retailers and distributors provides the company with opportunities for growth  the increasing size and importance of individual customers exposes simpson strong tie to potential over dependence 
the loss of any of the larger home centers and distributors as customers would have a material adverse effect on sst  unless and until either such customers are replaced or sst makes the necessary adjustments if possible to compensate for the loss of business

steel prices increased from their levels in mid  as steel mills have been raising prices as demand returns to global steel markets

critical accounting policies and estimates the critical policies described below affect the company s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
if the company s business conditions change or if it uses different assumptions or estimates in the application of these and other accounting policies  the company s future results of operations could be adversely affected 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value market 
cost includes all costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition  as follows raw materials and purchased finished goods principally valued at cost determined on a weighted average basis 
in process products and finished goods cost of direct materials and labor plus attributable overhead based on a normal level of activity 
the company writes the gross value of the inventory down to its net realizable value 
the company estimates net realizable value based on estimated selling price less further costs to completion and disposal 
the company impairs slow moving products by comparing inventories on hand to future projected demand 
obsolete inventory is on hand supply of a product in excess of two years sales of that product or a supply of that product that the company believes is no longer marketable 
the company revalues obsolete inventory as having no net realizable value and impairs its full carrying value 
the company has consistently applied this methodology 
the company believes that this approach is prudent and makes suitable provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory 
when provisions are established  a new cost basis of the inventory is created 
comparable inventory values are as follows in thousands december  gross inventories raw materials in process products finished goods less slow moving  obsolete and net realizable value provisions net inventory valuation activity in the inventory reserve is summarized as follows in thousands years ended december  beginning balance provisions released following disposal of inventory additional provisions made ending balance unexpected change in market demand  building codes or buyer preferences could reduce the rate of inventory turnover and require the company to increase its reserve for obsolescence 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete  net of applicable provision for discounts  returns and incentives  whether actual or estimated  based on the company s experience 
this generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the sales agreement or purchase order  ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer  collectability is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable 
the company s general shipping terms are fob shipping point  where title is transferred and revenue is recognized when the products are shipped to customers 
when the company sells fob destination point  title is transferred and the company recognizes revenue on delivery or customer acceptance  depending on terms of the sales agreement 
service sales  representing after market repair and maintenance  engineering activities  software license sales and service and lease income  though significantly less than of net sales and not material to the consolidated financial statements  are recognized as the services are completed or the software products and services are delivered 
if actual costs of sales returns  incentives and discounts were to significantly exceed the recorded estimated allowance  the company s sales would be adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company assesses the collectability of specific customer accounts that would be considered doubtful based on the customer s financial condition  payment history  credit rating and other factors that the company considers relevant  or accounts that the company assigns for collection 
the company reserves for the portion of those outstanding balances that the company believes it is not likely to collect  based on historical collection experience 
the company also reserves of the amount that it deems potentially uncollectable due to a customer s bankruptcy or deteriorating financial condition 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts is summarized as follows in thousands years ended december  beginning balance adjustments  recoveries and write offs increase decrease to bad debt provision ending balance goodwill impairment testing the intangibles goodwill and other topic of the fasb asc requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter for the company and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  or disposition or relocation of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies or a combination of market approaches  if information is readily available  and discounted cash flow methodologies 
this process requires significant judgments  including estimation of future cash flows  which depends on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for the company s business  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  and determination of the company s weighted average cost of capital 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
actual cash flows in the future may differ significantly from those assumed 
the company has allocated goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit or units expected to benefit from the acquisition 
reporting units are generally determined based on country or region of operations 
the impairment charge taken in  which was a result of the company s annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of  related to assets that were acquired in germany and ireland in and associated with the european anchor products reporting unit 
the reporting unit s carrying value exceeded the fair value  primarily due to reduced future expected net cash flows 
the impairment charge taken in  which was a result of the company s annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of  related to assets that were acquired in england in and was associated with the company s uk reporting unit 
the reporting unit s carrying value exceeded the fair value  primarily due to reduced future expected net cash flows 
the method to determine the fair value of the european anchor products and uk reporting units were discounted cash flow models 
at december   the remaining balance of goodwill of the uk reporting unit was million 
the goodwill associated with the european anchor products reporting unit was fully impaired 
these reporting units are both associated with the european segment
