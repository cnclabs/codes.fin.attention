item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with the selected financial data in item and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
all financial and operating data presented in items and reflects the continuing operations of our business for all periods presented unless otherwise indicated 
overview we are a healthcare services company that through our subsidiaries operates hospitals  nursing and rehabilitation centers  assisted living facilities and a contract rehabilitation services business across the united states 
at december   our hospital division operated ltac hospitals with  licensed beds in states 
our nursing center division operated nursing and rehabilitation centers and seven assisted living facilities with  licensed beds in states 
we also operated a contract rehabilitation services business that provides rehabilitative services primarily in long term care settings 
in recent years  we have completed several strategic divestitures to improve our future operating results 
for accounting purposes  the operating results of these businesses and the losses or impairments associated with these transactions have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for all periods presented 
assets not sold at december  have been measured at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value less costs of disposal and have been classified as held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the operating results of acquired businesses have been included in our accompanying consolidated financial statements from the respective acquisition dates 
rehabcare acquisition on february   we entered into the merger agreement with rehabcare  providing for our acquisition of rehabcare  with kindred as the surviving entity 
at december   rehabcare operated ltac hospitals  five inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and provided rehabilitation therapy services in acute care hospitals and  skilled nursing facilities in states 
rehabcare reported consolidated revenues of approximately billion and net income from continuing operations of approximately million in fiscal the merger will form the largest post acute healthcare services company in the united states with over billion in annual revenues and operations in states 
the combined company will be a leading operator of ltac hospitals  nursing and rehabilitation centers  skilled and acute care rehabilitation therapy contract services and inpatient rehabilitation facilities 
this transaction  valued at approximately billion  will further our cluster market strategy  add to our existing ltac hospital and skilled nursing contract rehabilitation therapy businesses and expand our service offerings to include the acute care inpatient rehabilitation therapy business 
we believe that the rehabcare acquisition will be highly accretive to our earnings and cash flows  provide significant long term strategic benefits and further enhance our future growth prospects 
the rehabcare acquisition is also consistent with our strategy of developing clinical and operational expertise across the post acute continuum of healthcare services 
at the effective time of the merger  each share of rehabcare common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time subject to certain exceptions will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration 
outstanding kindred common stock will not be affected by the merger 
upon completion of the transaction  rehabcare stockholders will own approximately of our outstanding common stock 

table of contents the consummation of the merger is subject to certain conditions  including the adoption by the rehabcare and kindred stockholders of the merger agreement  clearance under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of  as amended  receipt of certain other licensure and regulatory approvals  receipt of the proceeds of the financing described below  and other customary closing conditions 
the merger agreement contains customary representations  warranties and covenants  including covenants providing for each of the parties i to use reasonable best efforts to cause the transaction to be consummated and ii to call and hold a stockholders meeting and recommend adoption of the merger agreement  subject to fiduciary duties 
the merger agreement also requires rehabcare to conduct its operations in all material respects according to the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice until the closing of the merger 
rehabcare is subject to customary no shop restrictions on its ability to solicit acquisition proposals from third parties and to provide information to and engage in discussions with third parties about acquisition proposals  subject to a fiduciary duty exception in certain circumstances prior to adoption of the merger agreement by rehabcare s stockholders 
the merger agreement also contains certain termination rights and provides that i upon termination of the merger agreement under specified circumstances  including a change in the recommendation of the board of directors of rehabcare or termination of the merger agreement to enter into a written definitive agreement for a superior proposal  rehabcare must pay us a termination fee of million and ii upon the termination of the merger agreement under specified circumstances  including a change in the recommendation of our board of directors or our failure to complete the financing discussed below  after all other closing conditions have been met  we must pay rehabcare a cash termination fee of million 
we have obtained the commitment letter from jpmorgan chase bank  na  jp morgan securities llc  morgan stanley senior funding  inc and citigroup global markets inc in connection with the pending transaction 
these funds and existing cash balances are expected to be sufficient to fund the cash consideration to rehabcare stockholders and to refinance certain existing kindred and rehabcare debt 
subject to certain conditions  we expect to have in place approximately billion of long term financing  of which approximately billion is expected to be outstanding at the time of consummation of the pending transaction 
see item a risk factors risk factors relating to the rehabcare acquisition 
vista acquisition on november   we completed the vista acquisition  which was financed with proceeds from our revolving credit facility 
the vista acquisition included four freestanding hospitals and one hospital in hospital with a total of beds  all of which are located in southern california 
we did not acquire the working capital of vista or assume any of its liabilities 
all of the vista hospitals are leased 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies 
we rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition we have agreements with third party payors that provide for payments to each of our operating divisions 
these payment arrangements may be based upon prospective rates  reimbursable costs  established charges  discounted charges or per diem payments 
net patient service revenue is recorded at the estimated net realizable amounts from medicare  medicaid  medicare advantage  other third party payors and individual patients for services rendered 
retroactive adjustments that are likely to result from future examinations by third party payors are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the related services are rendered and adjusted as necessary in future periods based upon new information or final settlements 
we recorded income of approximately million in related to the favorable settlement of a prior year nursing and rehabilitation center medicaid cost report dispute 
a summary of revenues by payor type follows in thousands year ended december  medicare medicaid medicare advantage other eliminations collectibility of accounts receivable accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from the medicare and medicaid programs  other government programs  managed care health plans  commercial insurance companies and individual patients and customers 
estimated provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded to the extent it is probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected 
in evaluating the collectibility of accounts receivable  we consider a number of factors  including the age of the accounts  changes in collection patterns  the composition of patient accounts by payor type  the status of ongoing disputes with third party payors and general industry conditions 
actual collections of accounts receivable in subsequent periods may require changes in the estimated provision for loss 
changes in these estimates are charged or credited to the results of operations in the period of the change 
the provision for doubtful accounts totaled million for  million for and million for allowances for insurance risks we insure a substantial portion of our professional liability risks and workers compensation risks through our limited purpose insurance subsidiary 
provisions for loss for these risks are based upon management s best available information including actuarially determined estimates 
the allowance for professional liability risks includes an estimate of the expected cost to settle reported claims and an amount  based upon past experiences  for losses incurred but not reported 
these liabilities are necessarily based upon estimates and  while management believes that the provision for loss is adequate  the ultimate liability may be in excess of  or less than  the amounts recorded 
to the extent that expected ultimate claims costs vary from historical provisions for loss  future earnings will be charged or credited 

table of contents provisions for loss for professional liability risks retained by our limited purpose insurance subsidiary have been discounted based upon actuarial estimates of claim payment patterns using a discount rate of to depending upon the policy year 
the discount rate was for the policy year  for the policy year  for the policy year and for all prior policy years 
the discount rates are based upon the risk free interest rate for the respective year 
amounts equal to the discounted loss provision are funded annually 
we do not fund the portion of professional liability risks related to estimated claims that have been incurred but not reported 
accordingly  these liabilities are not discounted 
the allowance for professional liability risks aggregated million at december  and million at december  if we did not discount any of the allowances for professional liability risks  these balances would have approximated million at december  and million at december  as a result of improved professional liability underwriting results of our limited purpose insurance subsidiary  we received distributions of million in  million in and million in from our limited purpose insurance subsidiary in accordance with applicable regulations 
these distributions had no impact on earnings and the proceeds were used primarily to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
changes in the number of professional liability claims and the cost to settle these claims significantly impact the allowance for professional liability risks 
a relatively small variance between our estimated and actual number of claims or average cost per claim could have a material impact  either favorable or unfavorable  on the adequacy of the allowance for professional liability risks 
for example  a variance in the allowance for professional liability risks at december  would impact our operating income by approximately million 
the provision for professional liability risks continuing operations  including the cost of coverage maintained with unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers  aggregated million for  million for and million for changes in estimates for prior year professional liability costs reduced professional liability costs by approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
with respect to our discontinued operations  we recorded favorable pretax adjustments of million in  million in and million in resulting from changes in estimates for professional liability reserves related to prior years 
provisions for loss for workers compensation risks retained by our limited purpose insurance subsidiary are not discounted and amounts equal to the loss provision are funded annually 
the allowance for workers compensation risks aggregated million at december  and million at december  the provision for workers compensation risks continuing operations  including the cost of coverage maintained with unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers  aggregated million for  million for and million for see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes the provision for income taxes is based upon our annual reported income or loss for each respective accounting period 
we recognize an asset or liability for the deferred tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
these temporary differences will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amounts of the assets are recovered or liabilities are settled 
we also recognize as deferred tax assets the future tax benefits from net operating losses nols and capital loss carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided for these deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 

table of contents our effective income tax rate was in  in and in we recorded favorable income tax adjustments related to the resolution of certain income tax contingencies from prior years that reduced the provision for income taxes by approximately million in and approximately million in each of and there are significant uncertainties with respect to capital loss carryforwards that could affect materially the realization of certain deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we have recognized deferred tax assets to the extent it is more likely than not they will be realized and a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets to the extent that it is uncertain that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
we recognized net deferred tax assets totaling million at december  and million at december  we identified deferred income tax assets for state income tax nols of million and million at december  and  respectively  and a corresponding deferred income tax valuation allowance of million and million at december  and  respectively  for that portion of the net deferred income tax assets that we will likely not realize in the future 
after our emergence from bankruptcy in  the realization of pre reorganization deferred tax assets and the resolution of certain income tax contingencies eliminated in full the goodwill recorded in connection with fresh start accounting 
after the fresh start accounting goodwill was eliminated in full  the excess of approximately million in was treated as an increase to capital in excess of par value and a reduction in the pre emergence deferred tax valuation allowance and pre emergence income tax liability 
we are subject to various federal and state income tax audits in the ordinary course of business 
such audits could result in increased tax payments  interest and penalties 
while we believe our tax positions are appropriate  we cannot assure you that the various authorities engaged in the examination of our income tax returns will not challenge our positions 
we record accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
accrued interest related to uncertain tax provisions totaled million as of december  and million as of december  to the extent the unrecognized income tax benefits become realized or the related accrued interest is no longer necessary  our provision for income taxes would be favorably impacted 
the amount  if recognized  that would favorably impact our results of operations approximates million 
the federal statute of limitations remains open for tax years through and we are currently under examination by the irs for each of these years 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
state jurisdictions generally have statutes of limitations for tax returns ranging from three to five years 
the state impact of federal income tax changes remains subject to examination by various states for a period of up to one year after formal notification to the states 
we currently have various state income tax returns under examination 
we received approval from the irs for an accounting method change for income tax purposes that resulted in a non recurring reduction in income tax payments of approximately million during our earnings were not impacted by this transaction 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill we regularly review the carrying value of certain long lived assets and identifiable finite lived intangible assets with respect to any events or circumstances that indicate an impairment or an adjustment to the amortization period is necessary 
if circumstances suggest that the recorded amounts cannot be recovered based upon estimated future undiscounted cash flows  the carrying values of such assets are reduced to fair value 

table of contents in assessing the carrying values of long lived assets  we estimate future cash flows at the lowest level for which there are independent  identifiable cash flows 
for this purpose  these cash flows are aggregated based upon the contractual agreements underlying the operation of the facility or group of facilities 
generally  an individual facility is considered the lowest level for which there are independent  identifiable cash flows 
however  to the extent that groups of facilities are leased under a master lease agreement in which the operations of a facility and compliance with the lease terms are interdependent upon other facilities in the agreement including our ability to renew the lease or divest a particular property  we define the group of facilities under a master lease agreement as the lowest level for which there are independent  identifiable cash flows 
accordingly  the estimated cash flows of all facilities within a master lease agreement are aggregated for purposes of evaluating the carrying values of long lived assets 
our other intangible assets with finite lives are amortized in accordance with the authoritative guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to years 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to perform an impairment test for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually or more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired 
during and  the market value of our common stock was below our book equity value 
management believes that the difference between our market equity value and our book equity during was generally attributable to uncertainty in equity markets related to certain medicare regulatory changes that went into effect october  for our nursing center division and rehabilitation services division and uncertainty related to the enactment of healthcare reform legislation during some of the uncertainty surrounding the medicare regulatory changes and its impact on us was alleviated on december  when we updated earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of and provided earnings guidance for the first time 
the earnings guidance  which included the impact of the regulatory changes for both periods  provided a stronger earnings outlook than expected by investors 
management believes that the difference between our market equity value and our book equity value during was generally attributable to uncertainty in the equity markets related to proposed federal healthcare reform legislation and certain medicare revenue reductions announced by cms during the year 
the difference between the book equity value and the market value of our common stock during and was a potential indication that the carrying value of our goodwill may have been impaired but was not viewed as a triggering event 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment test at the end of each fiscal year for each of our reporting units 
a reporting unit is either an operating segment or one level below the operating segment  referred to as a component 
when the components within our operating segments have similar economic characteristics  we aggregate the components of our operating segments into one reporting unit 
accordingly  we have determined that our reporting units are hospitals  nursing and rehabilitation centers  rehabilitation services  home health and hospice 
the carrying value of goodwill for each of our reporting units at december  and were as follows in thousands december  hospitals nursing and rehabilitation centers rehabilitation services home health hospice 
table of contents the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
based upon the results of the step one impairment test for goodwill and the impairment test of indefinite lived intangible assets in each of the last three years  no impairment charges were recorded in connection with our annual impairment tests 
since quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available  we applied judgment in determining the fair value of these reporting units for purposes of performing the goodwill impairment test 
we relied on widely accepted valuation techniques  including equally weighted discounted cash flow and market multiple analyses approaches  which capture both the future income potential of the reporting unit and the market behaviors and actions of market participants in the industry that includes the reporting unit 
these types of analyses require us to make assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows  industry specific economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
the discounted cash flow approach uses a projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital 
under the discounted cash flow approach  the projection uses management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period for each reporting unit including growth rates in the number of admissions  patient days  reimbursement rates  operating costs  rent expense and capital expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates  changes in working capital requirements and weighted average cost of capital 
the market multiple analysis estimates fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the reporting unit s operating results 
the multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics to the reporting units 
our analysis indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its book equity value 
our conclusions were supported by both quantitative and qualitative factors  including the estimate of an implied control premium for acquisitions in our industry  our fourth quarter operating results that exceeded investment analyst expectations and consideration of our updated business expectations at december  and we do not believe that any of our reporting units were at risk for failing the step one impairment test at december  our indefinite lived intangible assets consist primarily of certificates of need  which are estimated primarily using an excess earnings method  a form of discounted cash flows  which is based upon the concept that net after tax cash flows provide a return supporting all of the assets of a business enterprise 
the carrying value of our certificates of need at december  was million 
the fair values of our indefinite lived intangible assets are derived from current market data and projections at a facility level which include management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in the number of admissions  patient days  reimbursement rates  operating costs  rent expense and capital expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates  changes in working capital requirements and weighted average cost of capital 
at december   the fair value of our certificates of need intangible assets exceeded its carrying value 
we do not believe that any of our certificates of need were at risk for failing the impairment test at december  in conjunction with two acquisitions consummated in november  we also acquired medicare certifications with indefinite lives totaling million 
however  an impairment analysis was not conducted because there were no triggering events between the acquisition dates and december  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
although we have determined that there was no goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible asset impairments as of december   adverse changes in the operating environment and related key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets or declines in the value of our common stock may result in future impairment charges for a portion or all of these assets 
specifically  if the rate of growth of government and commercial revenues earned by our reporting units were to be less than projected or if healthcare reforms were to negatively impact our business  an impairment 
table of contents charge for a portion or all of the assets may be required 
an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations  but would not be expected to have an impact on our cash flows or liquidity 
recently issued accounting requirements in december  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued authoritative guidance related to goodwill and other intangibles 
the provisions of the guidance modify step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
the guidance is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of the guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our business  financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance related to business combinations 
the provisions of the guidance specify that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior year annual reporting period only 
supplemental pro forma disclosures have also been expanded to include a description of the nature and amount of material  non recurring pro forma adjustments included in the pro forma financial statements 
the guidance is effective prospectively for business combinations with an acquisition date on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the adoption of the guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our business  financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
in january  the fasb issued authoritative guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures 
the provisions of the guidance require new disclosures related to transfers in and out of levels and classifications as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the provisions also require a reconciliation of the activity in level as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements recurring fair value measurements 
existing disclosures also were expanded to include level fair value measurement valuation techniques and inputs 
the guidance is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures for level activity which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of the guidance did not  and is not expected to  have a material impact on our business  financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
in june  the fasb issued revised authoritative guidance related to the consolidation criteria for variable interest entities vie 
the guidance  among other things  requires a qualitative rather than a quantitative analysis to determine the primary beneficiary of a vie  requires continuous assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie  enhances disclosures regarding an enterprise s involvement with a vie  and amends certain guidance for determining whether an entity is a vie 
under the guidance  a vie must be consolidated if the enterprise has both a the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance  and b the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
the guidance was effective as of january  the adoption of the guidance did not  and is not expected to  have a material impact on our business  financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
upon adoption of the vie guidance on january   we reassessed our three investment partnerships and lease agreements under the new accounting guidance 
although the investment partnerships were determined to be vies  they do not require us to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vies  nor can we direct the activities that most significantly impact the vies economic performance 
as a 
table of contents result  the investment partnerships continue to be accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are not consolidated 
we also determined that three of our lease agreements were considered vies 
however  we are not the primary beneficiary of these leases as we lack the power to direct activities of the lessor that most significantly impact the economic performance under these leases 
in addition  our investments and involvement in lease arrangements related to these vies were not significant to our consolidated financial statements 
impact of medicare and medicaid reimbursement we depend on reimbursement from third party payors  including the medicare and medicaid programs  for a substantial portion of our revenues 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately of our total revenues before eliminations from the medicare and medicaid programs and the balance from other third party payors  such as commercial insurance companies  health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations and contracted providers 
the medicare and medicaid programs are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes

table of contents the year in review fiscal was a year of significant transition and change  including the enactment of landmark legislation related to national healthcare policy and reform 
while many of the provisions of healthcare reform will become effective several years in the future  it has prompted many discussions in our local markets between short term acute care hospitals  post acute providers  managed care plans  physicians and others to begin to address potential changes in healthcare delivery that the marketplace will demand 
revenues in increased to billion  while income from continuing operations declined to million  or per diluted share  from million or per diluted share in despite a decline in earnings  we reported robust operating cash flows in excess of million for the second consecutive year 
more importantly  we achieved a number of operational  development and financial goals that have positioned us for earnings growth in and beyond 
we entered with the expectation of reduced earnings prompted by volume weakness in our two major divisions and reimbursement rate pressures from both federal and state programs as well as commercial payors and managed care plans 
the confluence of both rate and volume pressure required a more intense focus on cost management and efficiencies at every level of the organization 
despite several operational challenges during the year  we did not waiver from our strategic operational and growth plan centered on improving our quality  taking care of our people  pursuing operational efficiencies  maximizing our operating cash flows and continued execution of our cluster market strategy 
we also entered the year facing significant regulatory changes that would become effective in the fourth quarter 
in our nursing and rehabilitation centers  significant changes in the medicare patient classification system known as rugs iv and related changes in patient clinical data collection mds required extensive planning  training and infrastructure investments across the organization 
in our peoplefirst rehabilitation therapy business  medicare related changes in billing for concurrent therapy services posed significant clinical and operational challenges that would affect the profitability of the rehabilitation services business as well as the operational results of our affiliated and unaffiliated nursing center clients 
our fourth quarter transition to the new rules for rugs iv  mds and concurrent therapy was successful from both a clinical and operational perspective 
while we are in the early stages of these medicare reimbursement policy changes  we believe that we are properly positioned to provide higher levels of care to medically complex patients who require more nursing  rehabilitation therapy and other ancillary services 
our successful transition resulted from outstanding clinical and operational leadership and collaboration across our lines of business that showed the strength of our organization and its ability to adapt rapidly to change 
our fourth quarter consolidated operating results were significantly higher than the same period in  bolstering our expectations for further growth in fiscal our acquisition and development program produced four transactions in that furthered our cluster market strategy 
these acquisitions included five ltac hospitals in southern california  three nursing and rehabilitation centers in the dallas fort worth market  a combined nursing and rehabilitation center and assisted living facility in cleveland  ohio and a home health operation in central ohio  each of which should provide additional earnings growth going forward 
rehabcare acquisition on february   we announced an agreement to acquire rehabcare to form the largest post acute healthcare services company in the united states with over billion in annual revenues and operations in states 
the combined company will be a leading operator of ltac hospitals  nursing and rehabilitation centers  skilled and acute care rehabilitation therapy contract services and inpatient rehabilitation facilities 
this transaction  valued at approximately billion  will further our cluster market strategy  add to our existing ltac hospital and skilled nursing contract rehabilitation therapy businesses and expand our service offerings to include the acute care inpatient rehabilitation therapy business 

table of contents hospital division revenues increased in to billion and in to billion 
during each of the past two years  revenue growth was primarily a result of increases in admissions  ongoing development of new hospitals and increases in medicare reimbursement rates 
for the year ended december   the vista acquisition contributed million in revenues 
aggregate admissions increased in and in on a same facility basis  aggregate admissions were relatively unchanged in and rose in medicare same facility admissions declined in each of and  while non government same facility admissions increased and in the respective periods 
hospital operating margins were in compared to in both and despite sluggish admission volumes in  low wage rate growth and changes to employee benefit programs stabilized overall compensation costs as a percentage of revenues at for both and however  growth in physician service costs and professional liability costs lead to an operating margin decline in physician service costs rose to million in while professional liability costs grew to million in average hourly wage rates were relatively unchanged in and rose in compared to the previous year 
as a result of certain plan changes in  employee benefit costs increased in following a increase in compared to nursing center division revenues increased in and in revenue growth in each of the past two years was primarily attributable to reimbursement rate increases that reflected both inflationary adjustments and higher patient acuity levels 
revenues for included pretax income of approximately million related to the favorable settlement of a prior year nursing and rehabilitation center medicaid cost report dispute 
on a same facility basis  nursing center admissions increased in and in compared to prior periods  while same facility patient days declined in and in compared to prior periods as a result of declines in average length of stay 
nursing center operating margins were in compared to in and in while we have generally executed well in our strategy to attract higher acuity medicare and managed care including medicare advantage patients  increases in rehabilitation therapy and pharmacy costs have reduced our operating margins 
rehabilitation therapy and pharmacy costs rose to million in and to million in in addition  medicaid rate pressures in many states also have contributed to lower operating margins 
during  we outsourced certain facility maintenance functions which resulted in a decline of approximately million in salaries  wages and benefits costs and a corresponding increase in other operating expenses 
average hourly wage rates increased in and in compared to the previous year 
as a result of certain plan changes in  employee benefit costs declined in following an increase in compared to 
table of contents rehabilitation division revenues increased to million in and to million in the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to growth in new customers in  and the volume of services provided to existing customers in both and revenues derived from non affiliated customers aggregated million in  million in and million in during  the division added new non affiliated rehabilitation services contracts with annualized revenues of approximately million 
during and  the division added and new non affiliated contracts  respectively 
operating margins declined to in from in  primarily as a result of the medicare related changes in billing for concurrent therapy services which became effective on october  operating margins in increased from in  primarily due to improvements in labor productivity levels and the volume of services provided to existing customers 
management believes that rehabilitation therapy operating margins will decline in primarily as a result of the medicare concurrent therapy rule changes that became effective in the fourth quarter of corporate overhead operating income for our operating divisions excludes allocations of corporate overhead 
these costs aggregated million in  million in and million in as a percentage of consolidated revenues  corporate overhead totaled in  in and in corporate overhead in included approximately million related to retirement costs 
we recorded approximately million in each of and and million in in other income related to the information systems and transition services agreements with pharmerica 
capital costs rent expense increased to million in and to million in the increase in rent expense in both periods resulted primarily from contractual inflation and contingent rent increases 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in  million in and million in the decrease in was primarily the result of an increasing number of older assets becoming fully depreciated 
the increase in was primarily a result of our ongoing capital expenditure program and hospital development projects 
interest expense aggregated million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in and was primarily attributable to lower interest rates and lower average borrowing levels under our revolving credit facility compared to investment income related primarily to our insurance subsidiary investments totaled million in compared to million in and million in investment income in all three years was negatively impacted by declining investment yields and by pretax other than temporary impairments of investments of approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively  held in our insurance subsidiary investment portfolio

liquidity operating cash flows and capital expenditures cash flows provided by operations including discontinued operations aggregated million for  million for and million for during each year  we maintained sufficient liquidity to finance our routine capital expenditures  our ongoing development programs  and our acquisition and strategic divestiture activities 
fluctuations in operating cash flows during the past three years were primarily attributable to changes in accounts receivable collections and the timing of income tax payments 
income tax payments were favorably impacted by realized losses on sales of discontinued operations and a tax accounting method change approved by the irs in our operating cash flows in each of the last three years exceeded our routine and development capital spending 
we utilize our revolving credit facility to meet working capital needs and finance our acquisition and development programs 
as a result  we typically carry minimal amounts of cash on our consolidated balance sheet 
based upon our expected operating cash flows  the availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility million at december  and the commitment letter  we believe that we have the necessary financial resources to satisfy our expected short term and long term liquidity needs

interest rates under our revolving credit facility are based  at our option  upon a libor plus the applicable margin or b the applicable margin plus the higher of the prime rate or over the federal funds rate 
our revolving credit facility is collateralized by substantially all of our assets including certain owned real property 
table of contents and is guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries 
the terms of our revolving credit facility include a certain defined fixed payment ratio covenant and covenants which limit acquisitions and annual capital expenditures 
we were in compliance with the terms of our revolving credit facility at december  despite the instability within the financial markets both nationally and globally  we have not experienced any individual lender limitations to extend credit under our revolving credit facility 
however  the obligations of each of the lending institutions in our revolving credit facility are separate and the availability of future borrowings under our revolving credit facility could be impacted by further volatility and disruptions in the financial credit markets or other events  including the bankruptcy of a lending institution 
at december   we maintained significant excess cash balances in the event that one or more of our lenders was unable to extend credit under our revolving credit facility 
we have obtained the commitment letter from jpmorgan chase bank  na  jp morgan securities llc  morgan stanley senior funding  inc and citigroup global markets inc in connection with the pending rehabcare acquisition 
these funds and existing cash balances are expected to be sufficient to fund the cash consideration to rehabcare stockholders and to refinance certain existing kindred and rehabcare debt 
subject to certain conditions  we expect to have in place approximately billion of long term financing  of which approximately billion is expected to be outstanding at the time of consummation of the pending acquisition 
as a result of improved professional liability underwriting results of our limited purpose insurance subsidiary  we received distributions of million in  million in and million in from our limited purpose insurance subsidiary in accordance with applicable regulations

as of december   we had approximately million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits and million of accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions 
because future cash outflows related to these unrecognized tax benefits are uncertain  they are excluded from the table above 
capital resources excluding acquisitions  routine capital expenditures expenditures necessary to maintain existing facilities that generally do not increase capacity or add services totaled million in  million in and million in hospital development capital expenditures primarily new facility construction totaled million in  million in and million in nursing and rehabilitation center development 
table of contents capital expenditures primarily the addition of transitional care services for higher acuity patients and new facility construction totaled million in and million in each of and these capital expenditures were financed primarily through internally generated funds 
at december   the estimated cost to complete and equip construction in progress approximated million 
we believe that our capital expenditure program is adequate to improve and equip our existing facilities 
expenditures for acquisitions totaled million in  million in and million in to the extent that these expenditures were not financed through the use of operating cash flows  we utilized our revolving credit facility to finance these transactions 
the more significant acquisitions in the past three years included the vista acquisition in november million  the purchase of three nursing and rehabilitation centers in september million and the acquisition of previously leased facilities in each of the last three years million 
in  we purchased the nursing centers from ventas for approximately million and subsequently sold these facilities for million 
see part item business discontinued operations 
in  we purchased for resale a ltac hospital for million that was previously leased and announced our intention to dispose of another ltac hospital and its related operations 
these two facilities are classified as assets held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet at december  other information effects of inflation and changing prices we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs 
congress and certain state legislatures have enacted or may enact additional significant cost containment measures limiting our ability to recover our cost increases through increased pricing of our healthcare services 
medicare revenues in ltac hospitals and nursing centers are subject to fixed payments under the medicare prospective payment systems 
medicaid reimbursement rates in many states in which we operate nursing and rehabilitation centers also are based upon fixed payment systems 
generally  these rates are adjusted annually for inflation 
however  these adjustments may not reflect the actual increase in the costs of providing healthcare services 
various healthcare reform provisions became law upon enactment of the aca 
the reforms contained in the aca will impact each of our businesses in some manner 
several of the reforms are very significant and could ultimately change the nature of our services  the methods of payment for our services and the underlying regulatory environment 
the reforms include possible modifications to the conditions of qualification for payment  bundling payments to cover both acute and post acute care and the imposition of enrollment limitations on new providers 
in addition  a primary goal of healthcare reform is to reduce costs  which includes reductions in the reimbursement paid to us and other healthcare providers 
moreover  healthcare reform could negatively impact insurance companies  other third party payors  our customers  as well as other healthcare providers  which may in turn negatively impact our business 
as such  these healthcare reforms or other similar healthcare reforms could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
there are continuing efforts to reform governmental healthcare programs  both as part of the aca enacted in and otherwise  that could result in major changes in the healthcare delivery and reimbursement system on a national and state level 
potential reforms include changes directly impacting the government and private reimbursement systems for our ltac hospitals  our nursing and rehabilitation centers as well as our rehabilitation operations 
reforms or other changes to the payment systems  including modifications to the conditions of qualification for payment  bundling payments to cover both acute and post acute care or the imposition of enrollment limitations on new providers  may be proposed or could be adopted by congress or cms in the future 

table of contents moreover  weak economic conditions also could adversely affect the budgets of individual states and of the federal government 
this could result in attempts to reduce or eliminate payments for federal and state healthcare programs  including medicare and medicaid  and could result in an increase in taxes and assessments on our activities 
in addition  private third party payors are continuing their efforts to control healthcare costs through direct contracts with healthcare providers  increased utilization review and greater enrollment in managed care programs and preferred provider organizations 
these private payors increasingly are demanding discounted fee structures and are requesting that healthcare providers assume more financial risk 
though we cannot predict what reform proposals will be adopted or finally implemented  healthcare reform and regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity through  among other things  decreasing funds available for our services or increased operating costs 
we could be affected adversely by the continuing efforts of governmental and private third party payors to contain healthcare costs 
we cannot assure you that reimbursement payments under governmental and private third party payor programs  including medicare supplemental insurance policies  will remain at levels comparable to present levels or will be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to patients eligible for reimbursement pursuant to these programs 
future changes in third party payor reimbursement rates or methods  including the medicare and medicaid programs  or the implementation of other measures to reduce reimbursement for our services and products could result in a material reduction in our revenues 
our operating margins may continue to be under pressure because of deterioration in pricing flexibility  changes in payor mix  changes in length of stay and growth in operating expenses in excess of increases in payments by third party payors 
in addition  as a result of competitive pressures  our ability to maintain operating margins through price increases to private patients or commercial payors remains limited 
these results could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
we believe that our operating margins will also continue to be under pressure as the growth in operating expenses  particularly professional liability  labor and employee benefits costs  exceeds payment increases from third party payors 
in addition  as a result of competitive pressures  our ability to maintain operating margins through price increases to private patients is limited
