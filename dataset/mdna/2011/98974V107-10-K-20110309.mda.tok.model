item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve numerous risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including but not limited to those described under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
except as otherwise required by law  we do not intend to update any information contained in these forward looking statements 
overview general we are a leading full service residential real estate brokerage focused on finding better  faster ways to connect clients with the information  tools and professional services they value to complete their residential real estate transactions 
we serve our clients through our combination of a leading online presence  robust proprietary technology and knowledgeable local real estate professionals in the field 
our award winning  user friendly website and mobile applications give our clients on the go access to comprehensive local multiple listing services home listings data  as well as other relevant market and neighborhood information and tools 
our proprietary technology  including our agent productivity platform  helps increase the efficiency of real estate agents while reducing customer acquisition and management costs  allowing us to invest in making our value proposition differentiated and more attractive to both clients and agents 
in  our website received more traffic than any other residential real estate brokerage in the nation  according to hitwise  an information services company 
as of march   we had approximately million active registered users who had accessed our website within the last year 
until  our agents were typically employees 
in february  we began transitioning to an agent independent contractor model in some of our markets  and we completed that transition in the remainder of our markets by january through that modified business model  we hope both to empower our local offices and agents to make decisions that are better tailored to the dynamics of their particular markets  thereby increasing productivity and customer service levels  and to minimize management oversight  thereby reducing costs for field sales support  corporate sales support and corporate administration 
as we convert a greater portion of our cost structure from fixed to variable  we should have greater leverage to attract and retain agents and to incentivize productivity 
in january  we announced plans to heighten our focus on our core strengths in technology  online marketing and our most attractive local real estate markets  where our financial performance  productivity and market presence have been strongest and where local population  economic and housing trends appear most favorable long term 
to that end  we closed our offices in the following markets in the first quarter of the markets of fresno central valley  ca  charlotte  sc  naples  fl  jacksonville  fl  miami  fl  palm beach  fl  tampa  fl  hartford  ct  minneapolis  mn  virginia beach  va  tucson  az  and atlanta  ga 
in the atlanta and tucson markets that we exited  we entered into our first local referral agreements  under which we power the online sales channel for leading local brokerages in those markets  and we have transitioned our local operations to the same brokerages 
after making these changes  we have wholly owned operations in major markets  serviced by our team of over  local  licensed sales agents  all of whom are independent contractors  as well as the referral arrangements in the atlanta and tucson markets 
our wholly owned operations include the markets of baltimore  md  washington  dc  boston  ma  chicago  il  dallas  tx  los angeles  ca  orange county  ca  phoenix  az  sacramento  ca  san diego  ca  the san francisco bay area  ca  seattle  wa  las vegas  nv  houston  tx  orlando  fl  austin  tx  the greater philadelphia area  pa  denver  co  richmond  va  salt lake city  ut  raleigh durham  nc  westchester county long island  ny  and portland  or 
all of these markets were 
table of contents opened prior to may these operations are supported by a corporate and sales support team that as of march  were composed of approximately employees  of which were full time employees  which includes the impact of a reduction in our field sales support workforce of roughly and in our corporate sales support and administrative workforce of roughly that occurred in connection with the agent transitioning and corporate restructuring initiatives discussed above 
our net revenues are composed primarily of commissions earned as agents for buyers and sellers in residential real estate transactions  and we operate in one reportable segment 
for clients who are buying homes  we typically share of our commissions with them in the form of a cash rebate 
we have begun testing in select markets alternatives to rebates that are designed to highlight and enhance the professionalism and high quality service of our agents 
in markets where the payment of cash rebates is not currently permitted by law  we have adjusted our home buyer value proposition by offering an enhanced client satisfaction guarantee 
for our clients who are selling homes  we typically represent them at commissions that are competitive in our markets 
our seller clients typically pay a total brokerage fee of to of the transaction value  of which to is paid to agents representing buyers 
we record commission revenues net of any rebate  commission discount or transaction fee adjustment 
our net revenues are principally driven by the number of transactions we close and the average net revenue per transaction 
average net revenue per transaction is a function of the home sales price and percentage commission we receive on each transaction and varies significantly by market 
we also receive revenues from certain marketing arrangements  such as with mortgage lenders to whom we provide access through the mortgage center on our website  who pay us a flat marketing fee that is established on a periodic basis  as well as from relationships with advertisers 
generally  non commission revenues represent less than of our net revenues during any period  although they topped in the fourth quarter of given relatively weak real estate sales in the quarter 
we routinely explore options for entering into additional marketing and other business arrangements for offering services related to the purchase  sale and ownership of a home 
we believe that customer acquisition is one of our core competencies  and although the difficulty of acquiring a sufficient number of leads online could increase over time  we expect that we can mitigate some of that impact with repeat and referral business  as well as by increasing our visibility and credibility to potential clients over time 
because our aggregate transaction volume market share in our markets has averaged less than historically  we believe that there is an opportunity to increase our market share and grow our business over the long term  even if the overall level of sales do not grow due to macroeconomic conditions 
market conditions and trends in our business macroeconomic forces 
for the past few years  the residential real estate market has been negatively impacted by macroeconomic conditions 
we perceive that conditions such as tight lending criteria  high numbers of distressed properties  and high unemployment continue to exert negative pressure on the residential real estate market  and may continue to do so for some time 
although the housing market was bolstered in by low mortgage rates  which reached a record low in october for a year  conventional  fixed rate mortgage  rates have since risen 
for  we currently believe that the health of the residential housing market will continue to be significantly affected by the availability of credit  shadow inventory levels  and interest rates  as well as any significant change in unemployment levels 
we cannot predict any changes in those macroeconomic forces  nor can we predict the combined impact of those changes on the residential real estate market 
the federal government  state governments and related agencies have acted repeatedly to address the decline in the residential real estate market and the availability of home mortgage credit 
some of those efforts  such as the federal first time home buyer tax credit  which is discussed below under fluctuations in quarterly profitability  temporarily boosted home sales in earlier periods  but often by accelerating home purchase decisions from later periods  not by creating new housing demand 
when such programs ended  the residential real estate market was left once again to suffer the pressures of poor macroeconomic conditions 
to the extent 
table of contents that governments and related agencies take future actions to address the residential real estate market  there can be no assurance that those activities will have a positive  meaningful and lasting impact 
as those activities end  the demand for housing  the availability of credit and interest rates could be negatively affected 
in late  given the large volume of distressed properties being handled by banks  concern grew that mortgage lenders may not be fulfilling all the legal requirements for valid foreclosure proceedings 
consequently  many large lenders temporarily halted foreclosure proceedings either nationwide or in the states where the foreclosure process must be approved by a judge 
most of those lenders have since lifted the freezes  but we perceive that banks are nonetheless processing foreclosures slowly and with caution 
we cannot assess what impact  if any  that caution will have on the residential real estate market 
current residential real estate market conditions 
recent indicators of national residential real estate market conditions include the following volume according to the national association of realtors  or nar  existing home sales nationwide in the fourth quarter of were down year over year  with declines in all major regions of the country 
those declines were due in large part to the positive impact in the fourth quarter of of the federal first time home buyer tax credit  which is discussed below under fluctuations in quarterly profitability  as well as the lingering economic pressures discussed above 
for full year  existing home sales reached their lowest level in years 
price according to nar  in the fourth quarter of  the median existing home sales price was relatively stable year over year  increasing by just 
we perceive that overall prices continue to be negatively impacted by the tight lending criteria for non conforming jumbo loans and the resulting constriction of the market for higher priced homes 
inventory according to nar  in december  inventory levels had increased by about year over year 
we are unable at the present time to tell what impact  if any  the foreclosure processing delays instituted by many major mortgage lenders will have on future inventory levels 
distressed properties currently  a significant percentage of our sales transaction volume is composed of distressed properties 
distressed properties are homes that are in foreclosure  are bank owned or reo  or are short sales  meaning a sale where the sale price is less than the loans or debt secured by the home listed for sale 
in the fourth quarter of  the percentage of our sales transactions composed of distressed properties was approximately  which was slightly higher than the realized the previous quarter but substantially less than the peak of realized in the first quarter of distressed properties not only tend to sell at reduced prices  but they also tend to put downward pressure on the values of other homes for sale in the same and nearby neighborhoods 
we expect distressed properties to continue to represent a significant portion of the residential real estate market and of our business for the foreseeable future 
shadow inventory shadow inventory refers to distressed and other properties that have not yet been listed for sale  as well as properties that homeowners wish to sell  but will not sell at current market prices 
shadow inventory can occur when lenders put reo properties properties that have been foreclosed or forfeited to lenders on the market gradually  rather than all at once  or delay the foreclosure process 
they may choose to do so because of regulations and foreclosure moratoriums  because of the additional costs and resources required to process and sell foreclosed properties  or because they want to avoid depressing housing prices further by putting many distressed properties up for sale at the same time 
it is difficult to assess the current volume of shadow inventory and its future impact on the residential real estate market  particularly given the uncertainty surrounding the foreclosure processing delays instituted by many major mortgage lenders  discussed above 
fluctuations in quarterly profitability 
we have experienced fluctuations in profitability from period to period 
our profitability has been impacted by various factors  including ongoing market challenges  government intervention  seasonality  and  in previous years  new market expansion and legal settlements 

table of contents for example  in  the federal government introduced a program to provide a tax credit of up to  to first time home buyers  meaning buyers who had not owned a home in the preceding three years  and a tax credit of up to  to repeat home buyers  meaning buyers who had lived in their current homes for five consecutive years in the past eight years 
to take advantage of the program  buyers must have entered into a home purchase contract by april   and must have completed the purchase by september  we believe that this program had a positive effect on home sales volume in and the first half of  particularly in the second quarter of however  we also believe that the program accelerated the decision to purchase a home for some buyers  which resulted in fewer sales in the second half of  and which may result in fewer sales than otherwise would have closed in future periods 
also  during the first half of  we anticipate that year over year comparisons in financial results will be distorted because of the positive impact of the federal tax credit program during the first half of industry seasonality and cyclicality 
the residential real estate brokerage market is influenced both by seasonal factors and by overall economic cycles 
while individual markets vary  transaction volume nationally tends to increase progressively from january through the summer months  then to slow gradually over the last three to four months of the calendar year 
revenues in each quarter are significantly affected by activity during the prior quarter  given the typical to day time lag between contract execution and closing for traditional home purchases 
for non traditional sales  the time lag from contract execution to closing can be longer 
we have been  and believe we will continue to be  influenced by overall market activity and seasonal forces 
we generally experience the most significant impact in the first and fourth quarters of each year  when our revenues are typically lower relative to the second and third quarters as a result of traditionally slower home sales activity and reduced listings inventory between thanksgiving and presidents day 
the impact of seasonality can be masked by the general health of the residential real estate market at any given point in time  whether affected by macroeconomic events such as the federal tax credit program discussed above  periodic business cycles or other factors 
generally  when economic conditions are fair or good  the housing market tends to perform well 
if the economy is weak  if interest rates dramatically increase  if mortgage lending standards tighten  or if there are disturbances such as terrorist attacks or threats  the outbreak of war or geopolitical uncertainties  the housing market likely would be negatively impacted 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
accordingly  our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and of those policies  we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we derive the majority of our revenues from commissions earned as agents for buyers and sellers in residential real estate transactions 
we recognize commission revenues upon closing of a sale and purchase transaction  net of any rebate  commission discount or transaction fee adjustment  as evidenced when the escrow or similar account has closed and funds have been disbursed to all appropriate parties 
we recognize non commission revenues from our other business relationships  including marketing agreements  advertising  referral and other income  as the fees are earned from the other party 
we recognize revenue only when there is persuasive evidence an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  the transaction has been completed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 

table of contents internal use software and website development costs we account for internal use software and website development costs  including the development of our ziprealty agent platform zap in accordance with the guidance set forth in the related accounting standards 
we capitalize internal costs consisting of payroll and direct payroll related costs of employees who devote time to the development of internal use software  as well as any external direct costs 
we amortize these costs over their estimated useful lives  which typically range between to months 
our judgment is required in determining the point at which various projects enter the stages at which costs may be capitalized  in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs  and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized 
the estimated life is based on management s judgment as to the product life cycle 
stock based compensation we follow the provisions of accounting standards for share based payments  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based payment awards made to employees  consultants and directors  including employee stock options and employee stock purchases  based on estimated fair values 
under the fair value recognition provisions of the accounting standards  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards expected to vest and recognized as expense using the straight line method over the requisite service period of the award 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model  which incorporates various assumptions including volatility  expected life and interest rates 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock and consideration of other relevant factors such as the volatility of guideline companies 
the expected life of options is estimated by taking the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option 
we estimate expected forfeitures based on various factors including employee class and historical experience 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period the estimates are revised 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from the differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the financial statements as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax amounts are determined by using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes will actually be paid or refunds received  as provided under current tax law 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense or benefit is the tax payable or refundable  respectively  for the period adjusted for the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the accounting standard for income taxes requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets  including our recent historical results and our expectations for the future 
historically  we have recorded a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  the majority of which relate to net operating loss carryforwards and we maintain that a full valuation allowance should be accounted for against our net deferred tax assets at december

we expect the negative revenue impact resulting from the decrease in transaction volume will be partially offset by higher average home prices in the remaining markets 
average net revenue per transaction is expected to continue to be impacted by factors including overall decreases in housing prices  the volume of distressed sales  including foreclosure  bank reo and short sale transactions  and ongoing pressure on the availability of consumer mortgage financing particularly impacting the sale of higher priced housing

liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity for are our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
as of december  and  we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at fair value of million and million  respectively 
we had no bank debt  line of credit or equipment facilities at december  and operating activities our operating activities used cash in the amount of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively

cash used in the year ended december  resulted primarily from a net loss million and the payment of a million litigation settlement accrued in the year ended december  partially offset by million of depreciation and amortization and million of non cash stock based compensation expense 
our primary source of operating cash flow is the collection of our net commission income from escrow companies or similar intermediaries in the real estate transaction closing process offset by cash payments for agents costs including commissions  payroll taxes  benefits  award programs and expense reimbursements  as well as for product development  sales and marketing and general and administrative costs including employee compensation  benefits  client acquisition costs and other operating expenses 
due to the structure of our commission arrangements  our accounts receivable are settled in cash on a short term basis and our accounts receivable balances at period end have historically been significantly less than one month s net revenues 
investing activities our investing activities used cash of million for the year ended december   and provided cash of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash used in the year ended december  primarily represents the purchase of property and equipment  including amounts for website development and internal use software  partially offset by the net proceeds from the sale and purchase of short term investments 
cash provided for the years ended december  and primarily represents the net proceeds from the sale and purchase of short term investments offset by the purchase of property and equipment  including amounts for website development and internal use software 
currently  we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately million primarily attributable to amounts capitalized for internal use software and website development as well as expenditures for increased server capacity and software 
in the future  our ability to make significant capital investments may depend on our ability to generate cash flow from operations and to obtain adequate financing  if necessary and available

the use of cash for the years ended december  
table of contents and represents primarily the repurchase of shares of our common stock in connection with the payment of withholding and payroll taxes due upon vesting of employee restricted stock awards 
the use of cash for the year ended december  represents primarily the repurchase of approximately million shares of our common stock directly from an investor during april the shares were originally issued in private placement transactions or pursuant to warrants acquired prior to our initial public offering 
our board of directors authorized the repurchase of the shares in a privately negotiated transaction for a purchase price of per share for a total purchase price of approximately million 
the closing price of our common stock on the date of the repurchase was per share 
future needs we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund cash used in our operations and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our level of investment in technology and business growth  advertising initiatives and possible repurchases of our common stock 
in addition  if the current macroeconomic environment and depressed state of the residential real estate market continues or worsens  we may have a greater need to fund our business by using our cash reserves  which could not continue indefinitely without our raising additional capital 
we routinely explore our options for offering services relating to the purchase  sale and ownership of a home  including services related to title insurance  escrow  mortgage  home warranty insurance and property and casualty insurance including auto insurance 
we expect that some of these services may be offered through affiliates including wholly owned subsidiaries  while others may be offered through joint ventures or promoted through marketing arrangements with independent third parties  such as title companies  banks and insurance companies 
we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
we have no bank debt or line of credit facilities 
in the event that additional financing is required  we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional capital when desired  our business  operations and results will likely suffer

table of contents non gaap measure the table below shows the trend of adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands net revenue adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin we present adjusted ebitda  a non gaap financial measure  as a supplemental measure of our performance 
we believe adjusted editda provides useful information regarding the operating results of our core business activity and prospects for the future 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss less interest income plus interest expense  provision for income taxes  depreciation and amortization expense  stock based compensation and further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider reflective of our ongoing core operating performance 
we present adjusted ebitda because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are reflective of our core operating performance 
in addition  we use adjusted ebitda to evaluate our financial results and business strategies  develop budgets  manage expenditures and as a factor in evaluating management s performance when determining incentive compensation 
our use of adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool 
some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements  for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  non cash stock based compensation is and will remain a key element of our overall long term incentive compensation package  although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating our ongoing operating performance for a particular period  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the impact of certain cash charges or credits resulting from matters we consider not to be reflective of our core ongoing operations  and other companies  including companies in our industry  may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than we do  which limits its usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of these limitations  adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with gaap 
when evaluating our performance  adjusted ebitda should be considered alongside other financial measures  including net income and our other gaap results 

table of contents the following is a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to the most comparable gaap measure  net loss  for the years ended december   and year ended december  reconciliation of non gaap adjusted ebitda to net income loss in thousands net loss add back interest income provision for benefit from income taxes depreciation and amortization stock based compensation expense non operating litigation recovery  net non gaap adjusted ebitda litigation for the year ended december  represents the recovery  net of legal fees  of approximately million from the settlement of a lawsuit we filed against a law firm that provided counsel in connection with certain employment matters in prior years partially offset by the settlement of a class action lawsuit filed by a former ziprealty agent in the amount of million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our investment policy requires us to invest funds in excess of current operating requirements 
the principal objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize income consistent with minimizing risk of material loss 
we believe this investment policy is prudent  and helps to reduce  but does not prevent  loss of principal  and results in minimal interest rate exposure on our investments 
as of december  and  our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market funds and our short term investments consisted primarily of investment grade  highly liquid interest bearing securities 
the recorded carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due to their short maturities and short term investments are carried at fair value 
the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of instrument is limited 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states  particularly since the majority of our investments are fixed income investments 
if market interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately and uniformly by from levels at december  and  the increase or decline in fair market value of the portfolio would be approximately million and million  respectively 
there have not been any material changes in the past year to our primary market risk exposures  or how these exposures are managed 
exchange rate sensitivity we consider our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal  as we do not have any sales  assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
we have not engaged in any hedging or other derivative transactions to date
