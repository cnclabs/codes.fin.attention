table of contents change change income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax the sale of quick pak was completed during fiscal year and additional income tax expense related to the sale was recorded in fiscal year there was no discontinued operations activity during fiscal year critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we continually evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories and any related reserves  income taxes  fixed assets  goodwill and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies impact the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
additionally  our senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates with the board of directors audit and finance committee 
for a more detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  refer to note of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue on sales of products when the customer receives title to the goods  which is generally upon shipment or delivery depending on sales terms 
revenues are generally denominated in the currency of the country from which the product is shipped and are net of applicable returns and discounts 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value and are maintained using the fifo first in  first out or specific identification method 
excess and obsolete cost reductions are generally established based on inventory age 
accounts receivable our customers are primarily major consumer product  food  and wine spirit companies and container manufacturers 
accounts receivable consist of amounts due from customers in connection with our normal business activities and are carried at sales value less allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is established to reflect the expected losses of accounts receivable based on past collection history  age and specific individual risks identified 
losses may also depend to some degree on current and future economic conditions 
although these conditions are unknown to us and may result in additional credit losses  we do not anticipate significant adverse credit circumstances in fiscal if we are unable to collect all or part of the outstanding receivable balance  there could be a material impact on the company s operating results and cash flows 
goodwill and other acquired intangible assets goodwill is not amortized and the company tests goodwill annually  as of the last day of february of each fiscal year  for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount 
impairment is also tested when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets carrying values may be greater than the fair values 
intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized using the straight line method  which estimates the economic benefit  over periods of up to twenty years 
intangible assets are also tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets carrying values may be greater than the fair values 
the company s  of goodwill at march  relates primarily to the acquisitions of collotype in and centrostampa and monroe etiquette in fiscal the company completed its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal the first step of the impairment review compares the fair value of the company to the carrying value 
the fair value was calculated as of february  by calculating the multi color market capitalization and adding a control premium and comparing it to the company s shareholders equity balance 
the result of the first step did not indicate potential impairment as the estimated fair value of its reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by  as a result  the second step of the impairment test was not required 
reasonably possible fluctuations in the stock price and market capitalization did not indicate impairment 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired and the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the determination of whether impairment exists involves various estimates and assumptions  including the determination of the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the assets involved in the review 
the cash flow estimates are based upon our historical experience  adjusted to reflect estimated future market and operating conditions 
measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value 
we base our estimates of fair values on quoted market prices when available  independent appraisals as appropriate and industry trends or other market knowledge 
changes in the market condition and or losses of a production line could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income 
the company did not record any material impairment charges to long lived assets during fiscal 
table of contents income taxes income taxes are recorded based on the current year amounts payable or refundable  as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences between the tax basis and reported book basis of assets and liabilities and result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years 
our accounting for deferred taxes involves certain estimates and assumptions that we believe are appropriate 
future changes in regulatory tax laws and or different positions held by taxing authorities may affect the amounts recorded for income taxes 
the benefits of tax positions are not recorded unless it is more likely than not the tax position would be sustained upon challenge by the appropriate tax authorities 
tax benefits that are more likely than not to be sustained are measured at the largest amount of benefit that is cumulatively greater than a likelihood of being realized 
derivative financial instruments the company accounts for derivative financial instruments by recognizing derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at fair value and recognizing the resulting gains or losses as adjustments to earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company manages interest costs using a mixture of fixed rate and variable rate debt 
additionally  the company enters into interest rate swaps whereby it agrees to exchange with a counterparty  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount 
the company s interest rate swaps have been designated as effective cash flow hedges at inception and on an ongoing quarterly basis and therefore  any changes in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income 
if a hedge or portion thereof is determined to be ineffective  any changes in fair value would be recorded in the consolidated income statement 
see note the company manages foreign currency exchange rate risk by entering into forward currency contracts 
the forward contracts have been designated as effective fair value hedges at inception and on an ongoing quarterly basis and therefore  any changes in fair value are recorded in earnings 
see note fair value disclosure the carrying value of financial instruments approximates fair value 
the company defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset  or paid to transfer a liability  in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements  the company uses a fair value estimating three level hierarchy that prioritizes the use of observable inputs 
the three levels are level quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities level observable inputs other than quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities level unobservable inputs the determination of where an asset or liability falls in the hierarchy requires significant judgment 
the company has two interest rate swaps  a  non amortizing swap and a  amortizing swap  to convert variable interest rates on a portion of outstanding debt to fixed interest rates 
the company adjusts the carrying value of these derivatives to their estimated fair values and records the adjustment in other comprehensive income 
the company has a forward currency hedge to fix the us dollar value of a press purchased in euros and delivered to the batavia  ohio plant 
the forward contract is designated as a fair value hedge 
the company adjusts the carrying value of this derivative to its estimated fair value and records the adjustment in earnings 
fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities are primarily used in goodwill and other intangible asset impairment analyses and in the valuation of assets held for sale 
the company tests goodwill annually  as of the last day of february of each fiscal year  for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount 
impairment is also tested when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets carrying values may be greater than the fair values
