table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  develop and market technology solutions that enable information technology  or it  services to be securely delivered on demand independent of location  device or network 
our customers achieve lower it operating costs  increased information security  and greater business agility using citrix technologies that enable virtual computing 
we market and license our products directly to enterprise customers  over the web  and through systems integrators  or sis  in addition to indirectly through value added resellers  or vars  value added distributors  or vads  and original equipment manufacturers  or oems 
executive summary our solutions can fundamentally change an information technology organization s approach and strategic value  transforming it into an on demand service by centralizing the delivery of applications and desktops 
further  this approach to it transforms data centers  making them far more flexible to adapt to the changing needs of an enterprise 
we believe our approach is unique in the market because we have combined innovative technologies in the area of desktop management  including but not limited to desktop virtualization and application virtualization  marketed as our desktop solutions  and server virtualization  application networking and optimization  marketed as our datacenter and cloud solutions  to deliver a comprehensive end to end application delivery solution  and one that  when considered as a whole  is competitively differentiated by its feature set and interoperability 
the global recession that started in impacted it spending  and we saw uncertainties surrounding it spending  particularly in the european markets in we expect this trend to continue as we enter the overall economic uncertainty may adversely affect sales of our products and services and may result in longer sales cycles  slower adoption of technologies and increased price competition  particularly in european markets 
in today s business environment  however  there is a sharp focus on it products and services that can reduce cost and deliver a quick  tangible return on investment  or roi 
with our customers focused on economic value in technology solutions  we intend to continue highlighting our solutions abilities to reduce it costs  increase business flexibility and deliver roi 
our desktop solutions are built to transform and reduce the cost of traditional desktop management by virtualizing the desktop  with our xendesktop product  and virtualizing applications  with our xenapp product  in a customer s datacenter  where they are more easily and efficiently maintained 
we plan to continue the initiatives that we began in the fourth quarter of and executed on throughout to accelerate our xenapp install base s adoption of our broader desktop solutions product portfolio through our xendesktop trade up program 
our datacenter and cloud solutions  which include xenserver and netscaler  can alter the traditional economies of the datacenter by providing much greater levels of flexibility of computing resources  especially with respect to servers  by improving application performance and thereby reducing the amount of processing power involved  and allowing easy reconfiguration of servers for multiple purposes 
our online services division is focused on developing and marketing web based access  support and collaboration services 
these services are primarily marketed via the web to large enterprises  medium and small businesses  prosumers and individuals 
our online services division s web collaboration services offer secure and cost effective solutions that allow users to host and actively participate in online meetings  webinars and training sessions remotely and reduce costs associated with business travel 
our remote access solution offers a secure  simple and cost efficient way for users to access their desktops remotely  and our remote support solutions offer secure  on demand support over the internet 
in addition  we expect to continue to grow our online services division by increasing our addressable market geographically and offering services that appeal to a wider range of customers 
to accelerate the european expansion of our online services division  in february  we acquired netviewer ag  or netviewer  a privately held european saas vendor in collaboration and it services 
netviewer will become part of our online services division and enable the extension of our saas leadership in europe 
our priorities for are to sustain the long term growth of our businesses and enhance our current solutions through technological innovation  engineering excellence  selective and strategic acquisition of technology  talent and or companies  and through a commitment to delivering high quality products and services to customers and partners 
we expect to continue our initiatives and make strategic investments in research and development of existing and new products  and to invest in research and development of advanced and innovative technologies for future application  including increasing research and development capacity and headcount 
we believe that delivering innovative and high value solutions through our enterprise division s products and our online services division s services is the key to meeting customer and partner needs and 
table of contents achieving our future growth 
we also intend to continue making significant investments to expand our brand awareness in virtualization  networking and cloud computing spaces 
we also plan to increase sales  consulting and technical services capacity and headcount to drive larger strategic customer engagements and more focus on si partnerships as well as investing in new channel programs that allow our partners to upgrade their capabilities in desktop virtualization  which we currently believe is our largest area of opportunity 
on january   we announced the implementation of a strategic restructuring program  or the strategic restructuring program 
the strategic restructuring program included reducing our headcount by approximately full time positions 
in the year ended december   we incurred a pre tax charge of million related to employee severance and related costs and costs related to the consolidation of certain of our facilities 
summary of results for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   we delivered the following financial performance product license revenue increased to million  license updates revenue increased to million  online services revenue increased to million  technical services revenue increased to million  operating income increased to million  diluted earnings per share increased to  cash flow from operations increased to million  cash and investment balances increased to  million  and deferred revenues increased to million 
the increase in our product license revenue was primarily driven by increased sales of our datacenter and cloud solutions  led by our application networking products and increased sales of our desktop solutions  led by our xendesktop product and xendesktop trade up program 
we currently expect our product license revenue to increase when comparing the first quarter of to the first quarter of the increase in license updates revenue was driven by sales of new licenses with subscription advantage 
our online services revenue increased due to increased sales of our web collaboration services 
the increase in technical services revenue was primarily driven by increased sales of support and consulting services related to our enterprise division s products 
our increase in operating income and diluted earnings per share was driven by our increased revenue as well as operating leverage gained by managing our overall operating expenses 
in addition  operating margin also included million of additional operating expenses related to our strategic restructuring program 
we currently expect that total revenue will increase when comparing the first quarter of to the first quarter of  as well as when comparing the fiscal year to the fiscal year 
during  we generated positive operating cash flows of million 
these cash flows related primarily to net income of million  adjusted for  among other things  non cash charges including depreciation and amortization of million  stock based compensation expense of million and the tax effect of stock based compensation of million 
also contributing to these cash inflows is an aggregate increase in cash flow from our operating assets and liabilities of million  net of the effects of acquisitions 
these operating cash inflows are partially offset by the excess benefit from the exercise of stock options of million and million related to a deferred income tax benefit 
the increase in cash and investments at december  as compared to december   was primarily due to cash provided by our operating activities of million and cash received from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock based compensation plans of million  partially offset by expenditures made on our stock repurchases of million and purchases of property and equipment of million 
the increase in deferred revenues at december  compared to december  was primarily due to increased sales and renewals of our subscription advantage product of million and increased sales of our support services of million 
our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  our net revenues have fluctuated quarterly and have generally been the highest in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year end spending trends 
this seasonal factor also typically results in net revenue during the fourth quarter of any year being typically higher than the revenue for the first quarter of the subsequent year 

table of contents acquisitions on september   we acquired all of the issued and outstanding securities of vmlogix inc  or vmlogix  a privately held corporation headquartered in santa clara  california 
vmlogix is a provider of virtualization management software for private and public cloud computing systems 
the total consideration for this transaction was approximately million  comprised of approximately million in cash and approximately million related to vmlogix liabilities settled in conjunction with the acquisition 
the sources of funds for this transaction consisted of available cash 
we recorded approximately million of goodwill  which is not deductible for tax purposes  and acquired million in assets including million of identifiable intangible assets  of which million is related to product related intangible assets with a useful life of years and million is related to other intangible assets with a useful life of years 
we assumed liabilities of approximately million in conjunction with the acquisition 
in addition  we also assumed stock options for which the vesting period reset fully upon the closing of the transaction 
when these stock options vest  they will be exercisable for up to  shares of our common stock 
we have included the effect of this transaction in our results of operations prospectively from the date of the acquisition  which effect was not material to our consolidated results 
during the first quarter of  we acquired two privately held companies for a total cash consideration of approximately million 
we recorded approximately million of goodwill  which is not deductible for tax purposes  and acquired million in assets including million of identifiable intangible assets  of which million is related to product related intangible assets with a weighted average useful life of years and million is related to other intangible assets with a weighted average useful life of years 
in addition  we assumed liabilities of approximately million in conjunction with the acquisitions 
we have included the effects of these transactions in our results of operations prospectively from the respective dates of the acquisitions  which were not material to our consolidated results 
acquisition in october  we acquired all of the issued and outstanding securities of vapps  inc  or vapps  a privately held corporation headquartered in hoboken  new jersey 
vapps offers high quality audio conferencing solutions to small and medium sized businesses and enterprise and service provider markets that complement our online services 
the total consideration for this transaction was approximately million in cash  including million in transaction costs 
at the time of the acquisition  if certain financial and operational milestones are achieved by the vapps business  contingent consideration of up to approximately million may be earned 
as of december   million and million was earned in and  respectively 
the sources of funds for this transaction consisted of available cash and investments 
in addition  we assumed unvested stock options upon the closing of the transaction  which will become exercisable upon vesting for approximately million shares of our common stock 
in connection with the vapps acquisition  we allocated million to goodwill  million to product related technologies and million to other intangible assets 
the goodwill related to the vapps acquisition was allocated to our online services division and is not deductible for tax purposes 
netviewer ag acquisition in december  we entered into an agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding securities of netviewer ag  or netviewer  a privately held european saas vendor in collaboration and it services 
netviewer will become part of our online services division and the acquisition will enable the extension of our saas leadership in europe 
the acquisition closed in february and the total preliminary consideration for this transaction was approximately million and was payable in cash 
in addition  in connection with the acquisition we converted and assumed approximately  non vested stock units 
transaction costs associated with the acquisition are currently estimated at million  of which we expensed million in and are included in general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  in process research and development for acquisitions the fair values used in determining the purchase price allocation for certain intangible assets for our acquisitions were based on estimated discounted future cash flows  royalty rates and historical data  among other information 
purchased in process research and development  or ipr d  of million was expensed immediately upon the closing of the acquisition of vapps because it pertained to technology that was not currently technologically feasible  meaning it had not reached the working model stage  did not contain all of the major functions planned for the product  was not ready for initial customer testing and had no alternative future use 
the fair value assigned to ipr d was determined using the income approach  which includes estimating the revenue and expenses associated with a project s sales cycle and by estimating the amount of after tax cash flows attributable to the projects 
the future cash flows were discounted to present value utilizing an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return  which was 
the rate of return determination included a factor that takes into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the ipr d 

table of contents in  we adopted new accounting rules for acquisitions and future ipr d will be capitalized 
no ipr d was capitalized in and critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
we base these estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and these estimates form the basis for our judgments concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we periodically evaluate these estimates and judgments based on available information and experience 
actual results could differ from our estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
if actual results significantly differ from our estimates  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted 
we believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business  results of operations and financial condition because they involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the development  selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors and our independent auditors  and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the accounting related to revenue recognition in the software industry is complex and affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices  both of which are subject to change 
as a result  revenue recognition accounting rules require us to make significant judgments 
in addition  our judgment is required in assessing the probability of collection  which is generally based on evaluation of customer specific information  historical collection experience and economic market conditions 
if market conditions continue to decline  or if the financial condition of our distributors or customers deteriorates  we may be unable to determine that collectability is probable  and we could be required to defer the recognition of revenue until we receive customer payments 
we license most of our software products bundled with a one year contract for license updates that provide the end user with enhancements and unspecified upgrades to the licensed product on a when and if available basis 
customers may also elect to purchase subscriptions for license updates  when not bundled with the initial product license 
customers may also elect to purchase maintenance  technical support  product training or consulting services 
we allocate revenue to license updates  maintenance and any other undelivered elements of the arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value of each element and such amounts are deferred until the applicable delivery criteria and other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the balance of the revenue  net of any discounts inherent in the arrangement  is recognized at the outset of the arrangement using the residual method as the product licenses are delivered 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of each undelivered element based on the vsoe of fair value  we defer revenue recognition until all elements are delivered or services have been performed  or until fair value can be objectively determined 
we must apply judgment in determining all elements of the arrangement and in determining the vsoe of fair value for each element  considering the price charged for each product on a stand alone basis or applicable renewal rates for subscriptions related to new products 
in the normal course of business  we are not obligated to accept product returns from our distributors under any conditions  unless the product item is defective in manufacture 
we establish provisions for estimated returns  as well as other sales allowances  concurrently with the recognition of revenue 
the provisions are established based upon consideration of a variety of factors  including  among other things  recent and historical return rates for both  specific products and distributors  and the impact of any new product releases and projected economic conditions 
our ability to recognize revenue upon shipment to our distributors is predicated on our ability to reliably estimate returns 
if actual experience or changes in market condition impairs our ability to estimate returns  we would be required to defer the recognition of revenue until the delivery of the product to the end user 
product returns are provided for in the consolidated financial statements and have historically been within our expectations 
allowances for estimated product 
table of contents returns amounted to approximately million at december  and million at december  we also record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including volume based incentives  at the time the sale is recorded 
we could take actions to increase our customer incentive offerings  which could result in an incremental reduction to our revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
stock based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of the authoritative guidance  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service or performance period  which is the vesting period 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  the expected term of the award  the risk free interest rate and any expected dividends 
for purposes of determining the expected volatility factor  we used the implied volatility in two year market traded options on our common stock based on third party volatility quotes in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
the expected term of our options is based on historical employee exercise patterns 
we also analyzed our historical pattern of option exercises based on certain demographic characteristics and we determined that there were no meaningful differences in option exercise activity based on demographic characteristics 
the approximate risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on us treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms equivalent to the expected term on our options 
we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and  accordingly  we used a dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all stock based payment awards that vest based on service  including those with graded vesting schedules  are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
we issue non vested stock units with performance goals to certain senior members of management 
the number of non vested stock units underlying each award may be determined based on a range of attainment within defined performance goals 
we are required to estimate the attainment that will be achieved related to the defined performance goals and number of non vested stock units that will ultimately be awarded in order to recognize compensation expense over the vesting period 
if our initial estimates of performance goal attainment change  the related expense may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on those estimates and if the performance goals are not met  no compensation cost will be recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost will be reversed 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to options and non vested stock units 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the stock based compensation expense we recognize in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and earnings per share 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
these characteristics are not present in our option grants 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire with little or no intrinsic value compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  the value realized from these instruments may be significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there is currently no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  for further information regarding our adoption of the authoritative guidance for stock based compensation 
valuation and classification of investments the authoritative guidance  which among other things  defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date an exit price 
our investments are carried at fair value and in determining their fair value we are sometimes required to use various alternative valuation techniques 
the authoritative guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available 

table of contents the authoritative guidance establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  described as level  and the lowest priority to valuation techniques using unobservable inputs  described as level observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability that are based on market data obtained from independent sources  such as market quoted prices 
when level observable inputs for our investments are not available to determine their fair value  we must then use other inputs which may include indicative pricing for securities from the same issuer with similar terms or unobservable inputs that reflect our estimates of the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the investments based on the best information available in the circumstances 
when valuation techniques  other than those described as level are utilized  management must make estimations and judgments in determining the fair value for its investments 
the degree to which management s estimation and judgment is required is generally dependent upon the market pricing available for the investments  the availability of observable inputs  the frequency of trading in the investments and the investment s complexity 
if we make different judgments regarding unobservable inputs we could potentially reach different conclusions regarding the fair value of our investments 
after we have determined the fair value of our investments  for those that are in an unrealized loss position  we must then determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired 
we review our investments quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment 
this determination requires significant judgment and if different judgments are used the classification of the losses related to our investments could differ 
in making this judgment  we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments 
if the amortized cost of an investment exceeds its fair value  we evaluate  among other factors  general market conditions  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than amortized cost and our intent to retain or sell the investment and whether it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the investment before the recovery of its amortized cost basis  which may not be until maturity 
we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer  including industry and sector performance  rating agency actions and changes in credit default swap levels 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements and liquidity and capital resources for more information on our investments and fair value measurements 
product related technology assets we have acquired product related technology assets from our business combinations and other third party agreements 
in applying purchase accounting  we allocate a portion of purchase price of acquired companies to the product related technology assets acquired based on their estimated fair values 
we typically engage third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values and useful lives of product related technology assets acquired 
such valuations and useful life determinations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in determining the fair value and useful lives of the product related technology assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows earned from the product related technology and discount rates applied in determining the present value of those cash flows 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
we review acquired product related technology assets for impairment on a periodic basis by comparing the estimated net realizable value to the unamortized cost of the technology 
the recoverability of these technologies is primarily dependent upon our ability to commercialize products utilizing these technologies 
the estimated net realizable value of the purchased technology is based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such technology 
our assumptions about future revenues and expenses require significant judgment associated with the forecast of the performance of our products 
actual revenues and costs could vary significantly from these forecasted amounts 
as of december   the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from product related technology assets from these acquisitions is sufficient to recover their carrying value 
if these products are not ultimately accepted by our customers and distributors  and there is no alternative future use for the technology  we could determine that some or all of their remaining million carrying value is impaired 
in the event of impairment  we would record an impairment charge to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
goodwill at december   we had million in goodwill related to our acquisitions 
the goodwill recorded in relation to these acquisitions is not deductible for tax purposes 
our revenues are derived from sales of our enterprise division products which include our desktop solutions  datacenter and cloud solutions and related technical services and from sales of our online services division s web collaboration  remote access and support services 
the enterprise division and the online services division constitute our two reportable segments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  for additional information regarding our reportable segments 
we evaluate goodwill between these segments  which represent our reporting units 

table of contents we account for goodwill in accordance with fasb s authoritative guidance which requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets are not amortized  but are subject to an annual impairment test 
we complete our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis  during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  or more frequently  if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist 
in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill  we typically estimate future revenue  consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows 
based on these key assumptions  judgments and estimates  we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the goodwill carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value 
assumptions  judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions  judgments and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions  judgments and estimates could materially affect our results of operations 
there was no impairment of goodwill as a result of the annual impairment tests completed during the fourth quarters of and excluding goodwill  we have no intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives 
income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had approximately million in net deferred tax assets 
the authoritative guidance requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if  based on the weight of the evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we review deferred tax assets periodically for recoverability and make estimates and judgments regarding the expected geographic sources of taxable income and gains from investments  as well as tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
at december   we determined that a million valuation allowance relating to deferred tax assets for net operating losses was necessary 
if the estimates and assumptions used in our determination change in the future  we could be required to revise our estimates of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and adjust our provisions for additional income taxes 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain  thus judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes 
we provide for income taxes on transactions based on our estimate of the probable liability 
we adjust our provision as appropriate for changes that impact our underlying judgments 
changes that impact provision estimates include such items as jurisdictional interpretations on tax filing positions based on the results of tax audits and general tax authority rulings 
due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate  it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability and the realizability of our deferred tax assets could change in the future  which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the following discussion relating to the individual financial statement captions  our overall financial performance  operations and financial position should be read in conjunction with the factors and events described in overview and part item a entitled risk factors  which could impact our future performance and financial position

revenues net revenues of our enterprise division include the following categories product licenses  license updates and technical services 
product licenses primarily represent fees related to the licensing of the following major products our desktop solutions  comprised primarily of our desktop virtualization product xendesktop and our application virtualization product xenapp  and our datacenter and cloud solutions  comprised primarily of our application networking products netscaler  access gateway and branch repeater and our virtual infrastructure products  xenserver and essentials for hyper v 
in addition  we offer incentive programs to our vads and vars to stimulate demand for our products 
product license revenues associated with these programs are partially offset by these incentives to our vads and vars 
license updates consist of fees related to our subscription advantage program that are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is typically to months 
subscription advantage is an annual renewable program that provides subscribers with automatic delivery of unspecified software upgrades  enhancements and maintenance releases when and if they become available during the term of the subscription 
technical services revenues are comprised of fees from technical support services which are recognized ratably over the contract term  as well as revenues from product training and certification  and consulting services revenue related to implementation of our products  which is recognized as the services are provided 
our online services division s revenues consist of fees related to online service agreements from our web collaboration products which primarily include our gotomeeting  gotowebinar  hi def audio  and gototraining services  our remote access  gotomypc  and our remote it support which primarily include gotoassist and gotomanage 
our online services revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term 

table of contents year ended december  compared to compared to in thousands revenues product licenses license updates online services technical services total net revenues product licenses product license revenue increased during when compared to primarily due to increased sales of our datacenter and cloud solutions  led by netscaler  of million and increased sales of our desktop solutions  led by xendesktop and related programs of million 
product license revenue decreased during when compared to due to decreased sales of our desktop solutions  primarily xenapp  of million 
the decrease in xenapp sales in was driven primarily by weakness in the global economy 
we currently expect product license sales to increase when comparing the first quarter of to the first quarter of license updates license updates revenue increased during when compared to primarily due to an increase in new subscription advantage sales  led by increased xendesktop product sales 
license updates revenue increased during when compared to primarily due to renewals related to our subscription advantage program over a larger base of subscribers 
we currently anticipate that license updates revenue will increase when comparing the first quarter of to the first quarter of and when comparing the first quarter of to the fourth quarter of due primarily to renewals of subscription advantage 
online services online services revenue increased during when compared to and during compared to primarily due to increased sales of our web collaboration products 
we currently expect our online services revenue to increase when comparing the first quarter of to the first quarter of and when comparing the first quarter of to the fourth quarter of due primarily to sales of our web collaboration products 
technical services technical services revenue increased during when compared to primarily due to increases in support revenues of million driven by increased sales of our datacenter and cloud solutions and an increase in consulting revenues of million related to increased sales of our enterprise division s products 
technical services revenue increased during when compared to primarily due to increased sales of support services related to our datacenter and cloud solutions 
we currently expect technical services revenues to increase when comparing the first quarter of to the first quarter of consistent with the increase in product license revenue described above 
deferred revenue deferred revenues are primarily comprised of license updates revenue from subscription advantage  technical services revenues related to our support services and consulting contracts and online services revenues from annual service agreements for our online services 
deferred revenues increased approximately million as of december  compared to december  primarily due to increased sales and renewals of our subscription advantage product of million and increased sales of our support services of million 
we currently expect deferred revenue to continue to increase in the first quarter of while it is generally our practice to promptly ship our products upon receipt of properly finalized purchase orders  we sometimes have product license orders that have not shipped

table of contents segment revenues during the first quarter of  we changed how we measure profitability internally  develop our annual plan and allocate our resources from a geography based approach which included the americas  europe  the middle east and africa  asia pacific and our online services division  to a product division based approach 
this change reflects how we market and sell our products 
accordingly  we have revised our reportable segments to reflect the way we are currently managing and viewing the business 
our revenues are derived from sales of enterprise division products which primarily include our desktop solutions  datacenter and cloud solutions and related technical services and from our online services division s web collaboration  remote access and support services 
the enterprise division and the online services division constitute our two reportable segments 
an analysis of our reportable segment net revenue is presented below year ended december  revenue growth to revenue growth to in thousands enterprise division online services division consolidated net revenues with respect to our segment revenues  the change in net revenues for the comparative periods presented was due primarily to the factors previously discussed above

table of contents operating expenses foreign currency impact on operating expenses a substantial majority of our overseas operating expenses and capital purchasing activities are transacted in local currencies and are therefore subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to minimize the impact on our operating results  we generally initiate our hedging of currency exchange risks up to months in advance of anticipated foreign currency expenses 
when the dollar is weak  the resulting increase to foreign currency denominated expenses will be partially offset by the gain in our hedging contracts 
when the dollar is strong  the resulting decrease to foreign currency denominated expenses will be partially offset by the loss in our hedging contracts 
there is a risk that there will be fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates beyond the one year timeframe for which we hedge our risk

other expense income  net increased when comparing to primarily due to losses recognized on prepayments at par of securities purchased at a premium within our available for sale investment portfolio 
other expense income  net decreased when comparing to primarily due to foreign exchange gains related to financial statement remeasurement of million and a decrease in losses on investments that were determined to have an other than temporary decline in value of million

for more information see liquidity and capital resources and note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  income taxes we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to federal income taxes in the us as well as income taxes of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions 
with few exceptions  we are no longer subject to us federal  state and local  or non us income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to in  our effective tax rate increased to approximately from when comparing the three months ended december  to the three months ended december  primarily due to a larger benefit from higher tax credits recognized in the fourth quarter of when comparing the twelve months ended december  to the twelve months ended december   our effective tax rate increased to from primarily due to a larger benefit from higher tax credits recognized in and to a lesser extent higher income in geographic locations taxed at a higher rate 
we establish tax reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  certain of these positions may be challenged 
while it is often difficult to predict whether we will prevail  we believe that our tax reserves reflect the probable 
table of contents outcome of known contingencies 
as such  included in our effective tax rate for the year ended december  is an additional tax reserve of approximately million related to uncertainties arising from current and prior tax years partially offset by a reduction of approximately million in tax reserves related to the expiration of a statute of limitations for the tax year 
as of december   our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions totaled approximately million 
there was million included in the balance at december  for tax positions  which would not affect the annual effective tax rate and approximately million of accrued interest on tax positions  which is included in income tax expense 
we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
there can be no assurance  however  that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our effective tax rate 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain and judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes 
we provide for income taxes on transactions based on our estimate of the probable liability 
we adjust our provision as appropriate for changes that impact our underlying judgments 
changes that impact provision estimates include such items as jurisdictional interpretations on tax filing positions based on the results of tax audits and general tax authority rulings 
due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate  it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability and the realizability of our deferred tax assets could change in the future  which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
in june  we reached a settlement in principle with the irs regarding certain previously disclosed income tax deficiencies asserted in a revenue agent s report  or rar 
under the terms of the settlement in principle  we would agree to an assessment of income tax deficiencies in full settlement of all open claims under the rar and would resolve with finality for future years all of the transfer pricing issues raised in the rar 
based on this  we incurred a charge of million in in accordance with the authoritative guidance 
among other things  the authoritative guidance requires application of a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and non recognition of tax positions 
it further requires that a change in management judgment related to prior years tax positions be recognized in the quarter of such change 
the final settlement requires the finalization of tax deficiency calculations with the irs and a written agreement signed by the irs 
it is uncertain how long it will take to reach a final settlement with the irs 
there can be no assurances that a final written agreement will be obtained or that this matter will otherwise be resolved in our favor 
an adverse outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had approximately million in net deferred tax assets 
the authoritative guidance requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if  based on the weight of the evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we review deferred tax assets periodically for recoverability and make estimates and judgments regarding the expected geographic sources of taxable income and gains from investments  as well as tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
at december   we determined that million valuation allowance relating to deferred tax assets for net operating losses and tax credits was necessary 
if the estimates and assumptions used in our determination change in the future  we could be required to revise our estimates of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and adjust our provisions for additional income taxes 
we maintain certain operational and administrative processes in overseas subsidiaries and its foreign earnings are taxed at lower foreign tax rates 
we do not expect to remit earnings from our foreign subsidiaries 
liquidity and capital resources during  we generated positive operating cash flows of million 
these cash flows related primarily to net income of million  adjusted for  among other things  non cash charges including depreciation and amortization of million  stock based compensation expense of million and the tax effect of stock based compensation of million 
also contributing to these cash inflows is an aggregate increase in cash flow from our operating assets and liabilities of million  net of the effects of acquisitions

historically  significant portions of our cash inflows were generated by our operations 
we currently expect this trend to continue throughout we believe that our existing cash and investments together with cash flows expected from operations will be sufficient to meet expected operating and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
we continue to search for suitable acquisition candidates and could acquire or make investments in companies we believe are related to our strategic objectives 
we could from time to time seek to raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities for larger acquisitions

we generally invest our cash and cash equivalents in investment grade  highly liquid securities to allow for flexibility in the event of immediate cash needs 
our short term and long term investments primarily consist of interest bearing securities

trading investments we held municipal auction rate securities  the majority of which were triple a rated  whose underlying assets were generally student loans that were substantially backed by the federal government under the federal family education loan program through investment accounts managed by ubs financial services  inc  or ubs 
the market for municipal auction rate securities in our portfolio began experiencing auction failures in in november  we formally accepted the terms of a settlement  or the settlement  from ubs 
upon accepting the terms of the settlement  we received an enforceable  non transferrable right  or the put option  that enabled us to sell our auction rate securities back to ubs 
on june   we exercised the put option and sold all of our remaining investments in auction rate securities back to ubs at par

fair value measurements the authoritative guidance defines fair value as an exit price  representing the amount that would either be received to sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
as such  fair value is a market based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
as a basis for considering such assumptions  the guidance establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  level inputs  other than the quoted prices in active markets  that are observable either directly or indirectly  and level unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data  which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions 
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis we measure our cash flow hedges at fair value based on indicative prices in active markets and we generally measure our investments in available for sale securities at fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for identical securities 

table of contents we currently hold one available for sale investment for which quoted prices are not readily available  our million face value investment issued by aig matched funding corporation  or the aig capped floater 
in order to measure the aig capped floater at fair value we used a discounted cash flow model 
we then discounted those cash flows at a rate reflecting the market risk inherent in holding an aig security with a similar maturity as evidenced by pricing in the markets 
since utilizing a discounted cash flow model required us to make assumptions that were not directly or indirectly observable regarding the aig capped floater s fair value 
accordingly  it is a level valuation and is included in the table below 
assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs level put option long term investments total in thousands balance at december  proceeds received on level securities decrease in previously recognized unrealized losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss total realized losses gains included in earnings balance at december  realized losses gains included in earnings for the period are reported in other expense income net

stock repurchase program our board of directors authorized an ongoing stock repurchase program with a total repurchase authority granted to us of billion

the objective of our stock repurchase program is to improve stockholders returns 
at december   approximately million was available to repurchase common stock pursuant to the stock repurchase program 
all shares repurchased are recorded as treasury stock 
a portion of the funds used to repurchase stock over the course of the program was provided by proceeds from employee stock option exercises and the related tax benefit 
we are authorized to make open market purchases of our common stock using general corporate funds 
additionally  from time to time  we have entered into structured stock repurchase arrangements with large financial institutions using general corporate funds in order to lower the average cost to acquire shares 
these programs include terms that require us to make up front payments to the counterparty financial institution and result in the receipt of stock during or at the end of the agreement or the receipt of either stock or cash at the maturity of the agreement  depending on market conditions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the analysis methods we used to assess and mitigate risk discussed below should not be considered projections of future events  gains or losses 
we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
to mitigate foreign currency risk  we utilize derivative financial instruments 
the counterparties to our derivative instruments are major financial institutions 
all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of december  actual results could differ materially 
discussions of our accounting policies for derivatives and hedging activities are included in notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  exposure to exchange rates a substantial majority of our overseas expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in local currencies  including euros  british pounds sterling  japanese yen  australian dollars  swiss francs  indian rupees  hong kong dollars  canadian dollars  singapore dollars and chinese renminbi 
to reduce our exposure to a reduction in us dollar value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates  we have established a hedging program 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency expenditures 
our hedging program significantly reduces  but does not entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 

table of contents at december  and  we had in place foreign currency forward sale contracts with a notional amount of million and million  respectively  and foreign currency forward purchase contracts with a notional amount of million and million  respectively 
at december   these contracts had an aggregate fair asset value of million and at december   these contracts had an aggregate fair asset value of million 
based on a hypothetical appreciation of the us dollar from december  market rates  the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts would decrease by million  resulting in a net liability position 
conversely  a hypothetical depreciation of the us dollar from december  market rates would increase the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts by million 
in these hypothetical movements  foreign operating costs would move in the opposite direction 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates quantified above  changes in exchange rates could also change the dollar value of sales and affect the volume of sales as the prices of our competitors products become more or less attractive 
we do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows as a result of these foreign exchange forward contracts 
exposure to interest rates we have interest rate exposures resulting from our interest based available for sale 
we maintain available for sale investments in debt securities and we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer or type of instrument 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged 
the securities classified as available for sale are subject to interest rate risk 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes that ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest and reinvestment income 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points from december  and levels  the fair value of the available for sale portfolio would decline by approximately million and million  respectively 
if market interest rates were to decrease by basis points from december  and levels  the fair value of the available for sale portfolio would increase by approximately million and million  respectively 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate movements on our available for sale and trading investment portfolios 
this analysis does not consider the effect of credit risk as a result of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
during  we entered into the credit facility  as amended in  or the amended credit facility 
accordingly  we could be exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our long term debt 
this exposure relates to our million amended credit facility 
borrowings under the amended credit facility currently bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus and adjusts in the future in the range of to above libor based on our level of total debt and our adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda 
a hypothetical interest rate change would not have any current impact on our results of operations as we had no amounts outstanding under the amended credit facility as of december
