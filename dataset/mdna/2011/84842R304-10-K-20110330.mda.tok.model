item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company operates via two segments  biospherics and health sciences 
biospherics seeks to develop proprietary pharmaceutical products 
health sciences provides technical and regulatory consulting services to food  consumer products  biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  as well as providing technical support to the biospherics segment 
biospherics is dedicated to development of pharmaceuticals 
until june  this development was limited to developing d tagatose as a novel  first in class treatment for type diabetes 
in june  the company announced that it will actively seek a pharma partner to continue the diabetes development and that it will also explore d tagatose as a potential treatment for high triglycerides  a risk factor for atherosclerosis  myocardial infarction  and stroke 
d tagatose  a naturally occurring sugar  is a low calorie  full bulk sweetener previously approved by the food and drug administration fda as a gras generally recognized as safe food ingredient 
during human safety studies supporting food use  we discovered and patented a number of health and medical uses for d tagatose 
we hold the patents for use of d tagatose as a treatment for type diabetes and the license for the pending pct patent cooperation treaty patents for d tagatose in new formulations as a treatment for high blood triglycerides 
the use patents for d tagatose as a treatment for type diabetes expire in  not including extensions 
if approved for use as a drug by the fda as a treatment for type diabetes  we believe we will be eligible for a five year new chemical entity nce exclusivity period following fda approval 
similar legislation in europe could provide seven or more years of market exclusivity in the european union  if approved by the european medicines agency ema 
if patents are awarded for the drugs for treatment of hypertriglyceridemia  twenty years of market exclusivity would be obtained in the usa 
exclusivity in other countries could also be obtained by filing individual applications in countries covered by the pct 
results of operations compared with revenue and direct costs revenue and direct contract costs are primarily related to the company s health sciences business 
the consulting business generally provides services on either a fixed price basis or a time and expenses basis  charging hourly rates for each staff member involved in a project  based on his or her skills and experience 
engagement agreements typically provide for monthly billing and payment within thirty days of receipt  and permit clients to terminate engagements at any time 
revenue increased  between years compared to an increase in direct costs of  
the increase in direct costs is directly related to an increase in labor costs between years  while the current recession has suppressed the growth in revenue 
no substantial revenue is expected from the biospherics segment until the company is successful in selling or licensing its technology 
research and development research and development expenditures relate solely to the biospherics segment and consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  and other expenses related to our efforts to develop d tagatose for future commercialization 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
the clinical trials in the use of d tagatose for the treatment of type diabetes have been the primary focus of the biospherics segment 
the r d expenditures for and consisted of both the phase clinical trial and a related phase dose range study 
r d expenses decreased by million between years 
included in r d costs was an expense of million for the purchase of d tagatose in and none in the clinical portion of both trials were completed during each of the phase trial to determine efficacy of d tagatose as a treatment for type diabetes and the phase dose range trial to evaluate the effectiveness of lower doses of d tagatose in treating type diabetes were completed in late as we have determined that it would take several additional years of clinical trials and could cost as much as several hundred million dollars to seek and obtain fda approval for d tagatose as a diabetes drug  the safety portion of the phase trial has been terminated 
we are actively seeking a pharma partner to continue the development of d tagatose as a treatment for type diabetes  but there is no assurance that we would obtain such a strategic relationship 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  the company began shifting the focus of its r d efforts to the use of d tagatose in lowering triglyceride levels and anticipates a decrease in r d costs in the initial years of the triglyceride studies 
pre clinical trials for the use of d tagatose in lowering triglyceride levels will be conducted in and a human proof of concept trial may begin later in we estimate that it will likely take three or more years to complete the studies trials necessary to attract a pharma partner to complete the development and an additional years to complete all necessary studies for an nda filing 
we expect the r d expenses to be incurred in for pre clinical triglyceride trials will be substantially less than the r d costs incurred in when we were completing the phase and diabetes clinical trials 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and other administrative personnel  professional fees and other corporate expenses  including facilities related expenses 
s  g a expenses for increased  over those of the prior year 
expansion of the company s commercialization efforts of d tagatose as a treatment for type diabetes and high triglycerides accounted for approximately  of the increase between the years 
increased labor costs  including severance pay of  accounted for an additional  of the increase between the years 
other income in october  the company was awarded two one time grants from the us government under the patient protection and affordable care act 
the awards were for the company s and diabetes and triglyceride research 
as a result  in the company recognized  in other income  net of a related tax benefit of  interest interest revenue in and was primarily derived from interest earned on the net proceeds of the sale of the infospherix subsidiary in august and from the net proceeds of our equity offerings 
the decrease in interest revenue between years is attributable to the decrease in funds available for investing 
income tax benefit the income tax benefit was directly related to the above mentioned grants 
sales backlog the company s backlog as of december  and consisting solely of backlog from the health sciences business was approximately  and  respectively 
the company bills for its consulting services primarily on a time and expense basis and these amounts represent estimated contract values 
further  the company s consulting contracts are generally terminable or subject to postponement or delay at any time by clients 
as a result  backlog at any particular time is not a reliable indicator of revenues for any future periods 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of the contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue and expenses for the period reported 
estimates are based upon historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates are evaluated periodically and form the basis for making judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenue and expenses 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
spherix s critical accounting policies are those it believes are the most important in determining its financial condition and results  and require significant subjective judgment by management as a result of inherent uncertainties 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is set out in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
such policies are discussed below 
accounting for taxes and valuation allowances we currently have significant deferred tax assets  resulting from net operating loss carry forwards 
these deferred tax assets may reduce taxable income in future periods 
based on the company s losses and its accumulated deficit  the company has provided a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset 
cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment of valuation allowances 
we expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until an appropriate level of profitability is sustained  or we are able to develop tax strategies that would enable us to conclude that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets would be realizable 
new accounting pronouncements in january  new disclosures became effective relating to fair value measurements 
these enhanced disclosures have been fully adopted by the company and are reflected in note fair value measurements 
the adoption of these disclosure rules had no effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asc update no 
 which amends the revenue recognition topic of the codification 
this update provides amendments to the criteria in subtopic of the codification for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
as a result of those amendments  multiple deliverable arrangements will be separated in more circumstances than under existing us gaap 
the amendments establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable and will replace the term fair value in the revenue allocation guidance with selling price to clarify that the allocation of revenue is based on entity specific assumptions rather than assumptions of a marketplace participant 
the amendments will also eliminate the residual method of allocation and require that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method and will require that a vendor determine its best estimate of selling price in a manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a stand alone basis 
these amendments will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of these disclosure rules had no effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued an accounting update to provide guidance to enhance disclosures related to the credit quality of a company s financing receivables portfolio and the associated allowance for credit losses 
pursuant to this accounting update  a company is required to provide a greater level of disaggregated information about its allowance for credit loss with the objective of facilitating users evaluation of the nature of credit risk inherent in the company s portfolio of financing receivables  how that risk is analyzed and assessed in arriving at the allowance for credit losses  and the changes and reasons for those changes in the allowance for credit losses 
the revised disclosures as of the end of the reporting period are effective for the company beginning in the company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting update on its financial disclosures 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 business combinations disclosure of supplementary pro forma information  asu to amend topic asc business combinations  by improving disclosure requirements related to the business combinations performed during the year being reported on 
under the amended guidance  a public entity that presents comparative financial statements must disclose the pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination had occurred as of the beginning of the prior annual reporting period 
the company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this update might have on its financial disclosures 
liquidity and capital resources we expect to continue to incur substantial development costs in our biospherics segment in the next several years  without substantial corresponding revenue  and we will continue to incur ongoing administrative and other expenses  including public company expenses 
we intend to finance our activities through the remaining proceeds of the november  october and january registered direct equity offerings  which resulted in net proceeds of million  million and million  respectively  two one time grants totaling approximately  from the us government in support of the company s diabetes and triglyceride research 
received in the first quarter of  and additional funds we will seek to raise through the sale of additional stock in the future 
working capital was million at december   including million on hand 
management believes that this cash on hand  combined with the million of net proceeds of the january offering  provide us with sufficient cash to sustain operations for we expect that we will need to expend between million and million over the next twelve months to support our currently planned development operations 
this estimate assumes i continuing efforts to sell  license  or obtain a partner for the diabetes drug application  ii no further significant expenditures for developing d tagatose as a drug for diabetes  iii continuing development of d tagatose as a treatment for high triglycerides  iv ongoing operation of the health sciences segment at the current level of activity and v that we raise additional funds to continue our development efforts beyond this month period 
due to the nature of our business  we will need to raise additional funds on a consistent basis to continue operations and to fully pursue the triglycerides opportunity 
fundraising will likely require the issuance of additional equity securities and a purchaser of such securities will likely insist that such securities be registered securities 
nasdaq rules require stockholder approval for certain stock issuances constituting twenty percent or more of a company s issued and outstanding stock 
the company cannot be assured that it will be able to attract a purchaser of securities to raise the additional funds it will likely require  that the company will be able to obtain any required stockholder approval  or that the company will be able to have additional registered direct primary offerings 
if we reach a point where we are unable to raise needed additional funds to continue our business activities  we will be forced to cease our development activities and dissolve the company 
in such an event  we will need to satisfy various severance  lease termination and other dissolution related obligations
