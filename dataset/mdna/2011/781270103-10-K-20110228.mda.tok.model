table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a worldwide leader in the design  development  manufacture and support of high performance defect inspection  process control metrology and data analysis systems used by semiconductor device manufacturers 
we provide yield management solutions used in both wafer processing and final manufacturing through a family of standalone systems for both macro defect inspection and transparent and opaque thin film measurements 
all of these systems feature production worthy automation and are backed by worldwide customer support 
on january   we announced that we had acquired all intellectual property and selected assets from privately held rvsi inspection  llc  headquartered in hauppauge  new york 
the acquired business is currently known as the rudolph technologies wafer scanner product group wspg and has been integrated into our inspection product offerings 
on august   we announced that we had acquired adventa control technologies  inc adventa  headquartered in plano  texas 
the acquired business is currently known as the rudolph technologies process control group pcg and has been integrated into our data analysis and review group product offerings on august   we announce that we had acquired selected assets of the yield dynamics software business from mks instruments  headquartered in andover  massachusetts 
the acquired business has been integrated into our data analysis and review group product offerings 
rudolph s business is affected by the annual spending patterns of our customers on semiconductor capital equipment 
the amount that our customers devote to capital equipment spending depends on a number of factors  including general worldwide economic conditions as well as other economic drivers such as personal computer  cell phone and personal electronic device sales 
current forecasts by industry analysts for the semiconductor device manufacturing industry similar year over year capital spending plus or minus for we monitor capital equipment spending through announced capital spending plans by our customers and monthly published industry data such as the book to bill ratio 
the book to bill ratio is a month running statistic that compares bookings or orders placed with capital equipment suppliers to billings or shipments 
a book to bill ratio above shows that semiconductor device equipment manufacturers are ordering equipment at a pace that exceeds the equipment suppliers shipments for the period 
the three month rolling average north american semiconductor equipment book to bill ratio was for the month of december  decreasing from the september book to bill ratio of historically  a significant portion of our revenues in each quarter and year has been derived from sales to relatively few customers  and we expect this trend to continue 
for the years ended december   and  sales to customers that individually represented at least five percent of our revenues accounted for   and of our revenues  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  sales to intel corporation accounted for and of our revenues  respectively 
in  sales to taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co 
and samsung semiconductor  inc accounted for and of our revenues  respectively 
we do not have purchase contracts with any of our customers that obligate them to continue to purchase our products  and they could cease purchasing products from us at any time 
a delay in purchase or cancellation by any of our large customers could cause quarterly revenues to vary significantly 
in addition  during a given quarter  a significant portion of our revenues may be derived from the sale of a relatively small number of systems 
our macro defect inspection and probe card and test analysis systems range in average selling price from approximately  to million per system  our transparent film measurement systems range in average selling price from approximately  to million per system and our opaque film measurement systems range in average selling price from approximately million to million per system 
a significant portion of our revenues has been derived from customers outside of the united states 
in  approximately of our revenues were derived from customers outside of the united states  of which were derived from customers in asia and were derived from customers in europe 
in  approximately of our revenues were derived from customers outside of the united states  of which were derived from customers in asia and were derived from customers in europe 
in  approximately of our revenues were derived from customers outside of the united states  of which were derived from customers in asia and were derived from customers in europe 
we expect that revenues generated from customers outside of the united states will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues 
the sales cycle for our systems typically ranges from nine to months  and can be longer when our customers are evaluating new technology 
due to the length of these cycles  we invest significantly in research and development and sales and marketing in advance of generating revenues related to these investments 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our statements of operations data as percentages of our revenues

our revenues are derived from the sale of our systems  services  spare parts and software licensing 
our revenues were million  million and million in the years ended  and this represents a decrease of from to and a increase of from to the decrease in revenue from to is primarily due to weakness in the overall semiconductor equipment manufacturing sector 
the increase in revenue from to is primarily due to improving economic conditions leading to increased capital spending in the semiconductor industry 
the following table lists  for the periods indicated  the different sources of our revenues in dollars thousands and as percentages of our total revenues year ended december  systems and software inspection metrology data analysis and review parts services total revenue systems revenue decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to the decrease in the number of inspection and metrology systems sold during this period 
these changes in systems revenue reflect a decrease in inspection systems revenue of million and a decrease in metrology systems revenue of million from to the average selling price of similarly configured systems has been consistent and therefore did not have a material impact on our revenue for the same period 
the year over year increase in data analysis and review software revenues of million from to is primarily due to revenue from pcg  which is part of our data analysis and review products  and which was acquired in the third quarter of systems revenue generated by our latest product releases and major enhancements in each of our product families amounted to of total revenue for compared to of total revenue for the year over year decrease in parts and service revenues in absolute dollars from to is primarily due to overall weakness in the semiconductor market during parts and services revenues are generated from part sales  maintenance service contracts  system upgrades  as well as time and material billable service calls 

table of contents systems revenue increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to improving economic conditions leading to increased capital spending in the semiconductor industry 
this contributed to an increase in the number of systems sold from to these changes in systems revenue reflect an increase in inspection systems revenue of million and an increase in metrology systems revenue of million 
the average selling price of similarly configured systems has been consistent and therefore did not have a material impact on our revenue for the same period

systems revenue generated by our latest product releases and major enhancements in each of our product families amounted to of total revenue for compared to of total revenue for the year over year increase in parts and service revenues in absolute dollars from to is primarily due to increased spending by our customers on repairs of existing systems 
parts and services revenues are generated from part sales  maintenance service contracts  system upgrades  as well as time and material billable service calls 
deferred revenues of million at december  primarily consist of million for deferred maintenance agreements and million for systems awaiting acceptance and outstanding deliverables 
gross profit 
our gross profit has been and is anticipated to be affected by a variety of factors  including inventory step up from purchase accounting  manufacturing efficiencies  excess and obsolete inventory write offs  pricing by competitors or suppliers  new product introductions  production volume  customization and reconfiguration of systems  international and domestic sales mix  and parts and service margins 
our gross profit was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue from to is primarily due to an inventory write down of million in which had less of an impact on gross profit than the inventory write down of million in the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue from to is primarily due to higher revenues  including an increase in software sales  higher average selling prices and lower reserves due to better inventory utilization 
we do not track gross margin by the sources of revenue 
operating expenses the operating expenses consist of research and development 
the macro defect inspection  thin film transparent  opaque process control  and probe card test analysis market is characterized by continuous technological development and product innovations 
we believe that the rapid and ongoing development of new products and enhancements to existing products  including the transition to copper and low k dielectrics  wafer level packaging  the continuous shrinkage in critical dimensions  and the evolution of ultra thin gate process control  is critical to our success 
accordingly  we devote a significant portion of our technical  management and financial resources to research and development programs 
research and development expenditures consist primarily of salaries and related expenses of employees engaged in research  design and development activities 
they also include consulting fees and the cost of related supplies 
our research and development expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the year over year dollar decrease from to primarily reflects reduced compensation costs and lower project costs as part of cost reduction efforts  partially offset by an increase in litigation expenses and the inclusion of expenses related to the activities of the acquisition of pcg in the period 
the year over year dollar increase from to is primarily due to higher costs related to compensation  projects and litigation  as well as  the inclusion of engineering costs associated with the ydi acquisition in the third quarter of we continue to maintain our commitment to investing in new product development and enhancement to existing products in order to position ourselves for future growth 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of salaries and related costs for sales  marketing  and general administrative personnel  as well as commissions and other non personnel related expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the year over year dollar decrease from to in selling  general and administrative expense was primarily due to the elimination of administrative costs associated with prior business combinations  and lower compensation costs in the period  offset by expenses as a result of the adventa acquisition and manufacturing consolidation costs 
the year over year increase in selling  general and administrative expense from to was primarily due to higher compensation and corporate litigation expenses in the period 
impairment charge for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred 
impairment charge for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets was million for and for both and as of october  we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and determined that the fair value was not less than carrying value  therefore  there was no impairment of goodwill 
during our annual goodwill impairment test in october  we experienced a significant decline in our stock price 
as a result of the decline in stock price  our market capitalization plus an implied control premium fell significantly below the recorded value of our consolidated net assets as of october  
table of contents in performing the goodwill impairment test  we used current market capitalization  control premiums  discounted cash flows and other factors as the best evidence of fair value 
the impairment test resulted in no value attributable to our goodwill and accordingly  we wrote off all of our million of goodwill as of october  in connection with the goodwill impairment test  we determined that our identifiable acquired intangible assets were impaired 
the determination was based on the carrying values exceeding the future undiscounted cash flows and fair value attributable to such intangible assets 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million as of october   which represents the difference between the estimated fair values of these long lived assets as compared to their carrying values 
fair values were determined based upon market conditions  the relief from royalty approach which utilized cash flow projections  and other factors 
other income expense 
in  other income totaled million 
other expense was million and million in and  respectively 
the year over year dollar changes in other income expense were primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest income 
interest income was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the year over year dollar changes in interest income is primarily due to lower average interest rates 
income taxes 
we recorded income tax benefit of million and million  respectively  in and income tax expense was million in the income tax benefit for the year ended december  was million or of loss before benefit for income taxes 
the income tax benefit differs from the amount that would result from applying the federal statutory income tax rate of to our loss before benefit for income taxes  primarily due to our inability to record a full income tax benefit for the impairments of the goodwill and long lived assets and valuation allowances in taxable jurisdictions 
the income tax benefit for the year ended december  was million or of loss before benefit for income taxes 
the income tax benefit differs from the amount that would result from applying the federal statutory income tax rate of to our loss before benefit for income taxes  primarily due to valuation allowances in taxable jurisdictions 
income tax expense for the year ended december  was million or of income before provision for income taxes 
this differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of  primarily as a result of projected tax payments in us and foreign locations  offset by valuation allowances 
we evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets from future taxable income and establish valuation allowances if recovery is deemed not likely 
we consider available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
as a result of our analysis  we concluded that it is more likely than not that substantially all of our net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
therefore  we continue to provide a valuation allowance against these net deferred tax assets 
a portion of our net deferred tax assets relate to r d credits which are reserved for in our fasb asc provision 
we closely monitor available evidence  and may reverse some or all of the valuation allowance in future periods  if appropriate 
the valuation allowance increased million in and decreased million in  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and million in working capital 
at december   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million  while working capital amounted to million 
typically during periods of revenue growth  changes in accounts receivable and inventories represent a use of cash as we incur costs and expend cash in advance of receiving cash from our customers 
similarly  during periods of declining revenue  changes in accounts receivable and inventories represent a source of cash as inventory purchases decline and revenue from prior periods is collected 
however  for the year ended december  as our revenues declined our change in inventories represented a use of cash 
this was primarily due to increasing inventory related to new products and the acceleration of the slowdown in the semiconductor industry 
additionally  for the year ended december   as our revenue declined from million to million  our change in accounts receivables represented a use of cash 
this was primarily due to increasing sales in the fourth quarter of  offset by significantly lower sales in the fourth quarter of net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities for the years ended december  and totaled million and million  respectively 
net cash and cash equivalents used by operating activities for the year ended december  totaled million 
during the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable of million  net loss  adjusted to exclude the effect of non cash charges  of million  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of million  an increase in income taxes receivable of 
table of contents million  an increase in inventories of million  a decrease in accrued liabilities of million and a decrease in deferred revenue of million 
during the year ended december   cash used by operating activities was primarily due to net loss  adjusted to exclude the effect of non cash charges  of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in other current liabilities of million and a decrease in accrued liabilities of million  partially offset by a decrease in inventories of million  an increase in accounts payable of million  an increase in non current liabilities of million  an increase in deferred revenue of million and a decrease in income taxes receivable million 
during the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income  adjusted to exclude the effect of non cash charges  of million  an increase in accrued liabilities of million  a decrease in income tax receivable of million  an increase in accounts payable of million  an increase in deferred revenue of million  and increase in other current liabilities of million  partially offset by an increase of accounts receivable of million and an increase of inventories of million 
net cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities for the years ended december  and totaled million and million  respectively 
the net cash and cash equivalents provided by investing activities for the year ended december  totaled million 
during the year ended december   net cash used by investing activities included purchases of marketable securities of million  acquisition costs for business combinations of million  capital expenditures of million  partially offset by proceeds from sales of marketable securities of million 
during the year ended december   net cash provided by investing activities included proceeds from sales of marketable securities of million  partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of million  acquisition costs for a business combination of million and purchase of property  plant and equipment of million 
during the year ended december   net cash used by investing activities included purchases of marketable securities of million  capital expenditures of million  acquisition costs for business combinations of million  partially offset by proceeds from sales of marketable securities of million 
capital expenditures over the next twelve months are expected to be approximately million to million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in the and periods  net cash provided by financing activities was a result of proceeds received from sales of shares through share based compensation plans 
in the period  net cash provided by financing activities comprised proceeds received from sales of shares through share based compensation plans of million and tax benefit from share based compensation plans of million from time to time we evaluate whether to acquire new or complementary businesses  products and or technologies 
we may fund all or a portion of the purchase price of these acquisitions in cash  stock  or a combination of cash and stock 
in july  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to million shares of company common stock 
as of the time of filing this annual report on form k  we have not purchased any shares under this program 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the timing and amount of our revenues and our investment decisions  which will affect our ability to generate additional cash 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations and financing activities is insufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements  we may seek additional funding through bank borrowings  sales of securities or other means 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any such capital on terms acceptable to us or at all 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits that totaled approximately million at december  we are currently unable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount or periods when cash settlement of this liability may occur 
payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations open and committed purchase orders total off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  inventories  business acquisitions  intangible assets  share based payments  income taxes and warranty obligations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
these estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis  and by the audit committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
certain sales of our products are sold and accounted for as multiple element arrangements  consisting primarily of the sale of the product  software  installation and training services 
we generally recognize product revenue upon shipment 
in the limited circumstances where customer acceptance is subjective and not obtained prior to shipment  we defer product revenue until such time as positive affirmation of acceptance has been obtained from the customer 
customer acceptance is generally based on our products meeting published performance specifications 
the amount of revenue allocated to the shipment of products is done on a residual method basis 
under this method  the total arrangement value is allocated first to undelivered contract elements  based on their fair values  with the remainder being allocated to product revenue 
the fair value of installation and training services is based upon billable hourly rates and the estimated time to complete the service 
revenue related to undelivered installation services is deferred until such time as installation is completed at the customer s site 
revenue related to training services is recognized ratably over the training period 
revenue from software license fees is recognized upon shipment if collection of the resulting receivable is probable  the fee is fixed or determinable  and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate a portion of the total fee to any undelivered elements of the arrangement 
such undelivered elements in these arrangements typically consist of follow on support 
if vendor specific objective evidence does not exist for the undelivered elements of the arrangement  all revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the support period 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if our assumptions are otherwise incorrect  additional allowances may be required 
excess and obsolete inventory 
we write down our excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future product life cycles  product demand and market conditions 
if actual product life cycles  product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
business acquisitions 
we account for acquired or merged businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition or merger at their respective fair values 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as asset lives  can materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
accordingly  for significant acquisitions  we typically obtain assistance from independent valuation specialists 
there are several methods that can be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
for intangible assets  we normally utilize the income method 
this method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows 
these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams 
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the projected future cash flows including timing and the discount rate reflecting the risks inherent in the future cash flows 
determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment 
for example  different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives 
all of these judgments and estimates can significantly impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
goodwill 
our formal annual impairment testing date for goodwill is october st or prior to the next annual testing date if 
table of contents an event occurs or circumstances change that would make it more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process which requires us to make judgmental assumptions regarding fair value 
the first step consists of estimating the fair value of our aggregated reporting unit using the market value of our common stock at october st  multiplied by the number of outstanding common shares market capitalization and an implied control premium as if it were to be acquired by a single stockholder 
we obtain information on completed sales of similar companies in a comparable industry to estimate an implied control premium for us 
we compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value which includes goodwill 
if the results of the initial market capitalization test produce results which are below the reporting unit carrying value  we will also consider if the market capitalization is temporarily low and  if so  we may also perform a discounted cash flow test 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  the second step is completed to compute the impairment amount by determining the implied fair value of goodwill 
this determination requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any remaining unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill which is compared to the corresponding carrying value to compute the goodwill impairment amount 
long lived assets and acquired intangible assets 
we periodically review long lived assets  other than goodwill  for impairment whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses  such as future cash flows and disposition costs  may affect the carrying value of long lived assets and the impairment of such long lived assets  if any  could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
no such indicators were noted in share based compensation 
the fair value of our stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes valuation calculation requires us to estimate key assumptions such as future stock price volatility  expected terms  risk free rates and dividend yield 
expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock 
we use historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model 
the expected term of options granted is derived from an analysis of historical exercises and remaining contractual life of stock options  and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we have never paid cash dividends  and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends  and thus have assumed a dividend yield 
if our actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our share based compensation cost  or if different assumptions had been used  we may have recorded too much or too little share based compensation cost 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of our share grants and only recognize the expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our share based compensation expense could be materially different 
warranties 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
the need for a valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred taxes will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust the valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
at december   we had a valuation allowance of million on most of our deferred tax assets to reflect the deferred tax asset at the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step requires us to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that the tax position has met the threshold for recognition  therefore  we must evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the second step requires us to measure the tax benefit of the tax position taken  or expected to be taken  in an income tax return as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized when effectively settled 
this measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate the uncertain tax positions each quarter based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period 
although we believe the measurement of our liabilities for uncertain tax positions is reasonable  no assurance can be given 
table of contents that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
if additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit or litigation  it could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued amended guidance related to business combinations 
the amendments affect any public entity that enters into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis 
the amendments specify that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
the amendments are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  early adoption is permitted 
we will assess the impact of these amendments on our consolidated financial position and results of operations if and when an acquisition occurs 
in december  the fasb issued amended guidance related to intangibles goodwill and other 
the amendments modify step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
the qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance and examples  which require that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
for public entities  the amendments are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is not permitted 
we do not believe that this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued asu no 
 disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses topic 
asu no 
requires increased disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and allowances for credit losses  including disclosure about credit quality indicators  past due information and modifications of finance receivables 
the guidance is generally effective for reporting periods ending after december  the adoption of asu no 
did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition milestone method topic  which provides guidance on the criteria that should be met for determining whether the milestone method of revenue recognition is appropriate 
this asu is effective in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after june  we do not expect the adoption of asu no 
to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued asu no 
 compensation stock compensation topic  which provides guidance on the classification of a share based payment award as either equity or a liability 
a share based payment award that contains a condition that is not a market  performance  or service condition is required to be classified as a liability 
this asu is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  we do not expect the adoption of asu no 
to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 subsequent events topic amendments to certain disclosure requirements 
the objective of this asu was to remove the requirement for an sec filer to disclose a date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in both issued and revised financial statements 
this asu is to be applied immediately upon issuance 
we have adopted this asu in the first quarter of and the adoption of this asu did not have an effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this asu requires new disclosures regarding significant transfers in and out of levels and  and information about activity in level fair value measurements 
in addition  this asu clarifies existing disclosures regarding input and valuation techniques  as well as the level of disaggregation for each class of assets and liabilities 
this asu was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for certain level activity disclosure requirements  which are effective for reporting periods beginning after december  we adopted the new guidance in the first quarter of  except for the disclosures related to purchases  sales  issuance and settlements  which will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of because these new standards are related primarily to disclosures  their adoption has not had and is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations

the objective of this asu is to clarify which revenue allocation and measurement guidance should be used for arrangements that contain both tangible products and software  in cases where the software is more than incidental to the tangible product as a whole 
more specifically  if the software sold with or embedded within the tangible product is essential to the functionality of the tangible product  then this software as well as undelivered software elements that relate to this software are excluded from the scope of existing software revenue guidance  which is expected to decrease the amount of revenue deferred in these cases 
this asu is to be applied prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   which for us is the year early adoption is permitted  but this asu must be adopted in the same period as  and use the same transition method that is used for  the asu described in the following paragraph 
we do not expect the adoption of asu no 
to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued asu no 
on fasb asc  revenue recognition multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force 
the objective of this asu is to address the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit 
vendors often provide multiple products or services to their customers 
those deliverables are often provided at different points in time or over different time periods 
this asu provides amendments to the criteria in fasb asc for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
the amendments in this asu establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence is available 
the amendments in this asu also will replace the term fair value in the revenue allocation guidance with selling price to clarify that the allocation of revenue is based on entity specific assumptions rather than assumptions of a marketplace participant 
this update is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  of this new accounting update on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and credit market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates and market liquidity primarily from our investments in certain available for sale securities 
our available for sale securities consist of fixed and variable rate income investments us treasury and agency securities  asset backed securities  mortgage backed securities  auction rate securities and corporate bonds 
we continually monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates  market liquidity and credit ratings of issuers from our available for sale securities 
it is possible that we are at risk if interest rates  market liquidity or credit ratings of issuers change in an unfavorable direction 
the magnitude of any gain or loss will be a function of the difference between the fixed rate of the financial instrument and the market rate and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
based on a sensitivity analysis performed on our financial investments held as of december   an immediate adverse change of in interest rates eg to would result in an immaterial decrease in the fair value of our available for sale securities 
foreign currency risk we have branch operations in taiwan  singapore and south korea and wholly owned subsidiaries in europe  japan and china 
our international subsidiaries and branches operate primarily using local functional currencies 
these foreign branches and subsidiaries are limited in their operations and level of investment so that the risk of currency fluctuations is not material 
a hypothetical appreciation or depreciation in the us dollar relative to the reporting currencies of our foreign subsidiaries at december  would have affected the foreign currency denominated non operating expenses of our foreign subsidiaries by approximately million 
we cannot accurately predict future exchange rates or the overall impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
a substantial portion of our international systems sales are denominated in us dollars with the exception of japan and  as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to these sales 
substantially all our sales in japan are denominated in japanese yen 
from time to time  we may enter into forward exchange contracts to economically hedge a portion of  but not all  existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within months 
the change in fair value of the forward contracts is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations each reporting period 
as of december  and  we had four and twenty forward contracts outstanding  respectively 
the total notional contract value of these outstanding forward contracts at december  and was million and million  respectively 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
