overview we focus our design  development  manufacturing and marketing efforts on the high performance analog hpa segment of the semiconductor market 
digital and analog semiconductor components are the basic ingredient in today s electronic devices 
in contrast to the binary nature of digital components  analog components monitor  evaluate and modify electrical signals and strengths allowing them to deal with basic and essential properties such as heat  touch  light and sound 
the hpa segment is distinguished by its highly differentiated and technologically advanced products which can be building blocks for more complex circuits or highly integrated for specific applications 
historically  the hpa segment has yielded higher gross margins and suffers less competition than the digital and broader analog segments of the semiconductor market 
the hpa segment requires uniquely talented and experienced designers  engineers and specialized selling and marketing efforts to address the myriad of challenges associated with today s complex applications 
we began our transformation into a hpa company with the acquisition of elantec in fiscal year and the divestiture of our wireless networking business in fiscal year we further strengthened the transformation with the fiscal year acquisition of xicor 
our transformation has required us to report our financial performance with restructurings  impairments  discontinued operations and write offs attendant to our acquisitions 
our first full year as a pure hpa company was fiscal year since then  our focus has resulted in revenue growth that has been very broad based across our many analog and mixed signal products 
we have introduced hundreds of new products in each of the last few years including several new product families that have significantly 
table of contents expanded our served available market 
in april  we completed the acquisition of techwell  bringing unique capabilities which complement our industrial video businesses and making industrial our largest end market in fiscal year our investments to expand our product portfolio to over product families appear to be successful  which will enable us to reach our primary management goals of revenue growth with higher margins  growing operating income and increasing cash flow generation measured against the investment in the company

geographical revenue in millions fiscal year revenue of revenue revenue of revenue revenue of revenue asia pacific north america europe and other total 
table of contents revenue and cost of revenue revenue our revenue for fiscal year was million  an increase of million or from fiscal year the fiscal year revenue increase was driven primarily by increased revenue in the industrial end market  due to the acquisition of techwell  which broadened our industrial portfolio  as well as our focus on growing the more stable and higher margin industrial business 
we further increased revenue in the communications and high end consumer markets as revenues are returning to fiscal year levels  prior to the sudden down turn in the economy 
our revenue for fiscal year was million  a decrease of million or from fiscal year the fiscal year revenue decline was broad based and driven by revenue declines from all end markets 
deteriorating global economic conditions that began in fiscal year continued into fiscal year and resulted in reduced demand for our customers end products  which caused a severe reduction in orders of our component products 
demand and orders were further reduced as our customers began to work down their inventories  resulting in fewer replacement orders throughout the supply chain 
in fiscal year  first quarter sales continued to decline in all end markets except computing  which grew from fourth quarter levels 
in the second quarter  we began experiencing growth in all end markets 
sales in the fourth fiscal quarter of were million compared to million in the third fiscal quarter of and million in the fourth fiscal quarter of revenue by end market in millions fiscal year revenue of revenue revenue of revenue revenue of revenue industrial computing communications high end consumer total in aggregate  higher unit demand in fiscal year increased revenues by approximately million from fiscal year levels and an increase in asps increased revenues from fiscal year levels by approximately million 
of this net revenue increase  approximately million came from our sales to customers in the asia pacific region and million came from sales to customers in north america with europe and other countries increasing approximately million 
in aggregate  lower unit demand in fiscal year decreased revenues by approximately million from fiscal year levels and a decrease in asps decreased revenues from fiscal year levels by approximately million 
of this net revenue decline  approximately million came from our sales to customers in the asia pacific region and million came from sales to customers in north america with europe and other countries declining approximately million 
we anticipate that our revenue from asia pacific region customers will continue to grow as that region leads in the manufacture of the finished goods consumer electronics  computers  communications equipment in which our products are used 
end market demand for those products is global  and therefore  dependent on aggregate global economic metrics and conditions such as personal incomes and business activity and not necessarily on asian and pacific rim regional economic factors 
see business outlook elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relating to expected revenues in the near term 
cost of revenue cost of revenues consists primarily of purchased materials and services  labor  overhead and depreciation associated with manufacturing pertaining to products sold 

table of contents our gross margin increased by basis points in fiscal year from fiscal year the increase was primarily due to changes in the mix of product sold  our increased focus on highly differentiated products and manufacturing cost reductions 
generally  our computing and high end consumer products have lower gross margins than our industrial and communications products 
in fiscal year  the acquisition of techwell and our focus on higher margin products resulted in substantially increased revenues from the industrial end market  overall and as a percentage of total revenue 
our gross margin in fiscal year increased basis points from fiscal year  primarily driven by additional inventory charges taken in fiscal year in fiscal year  we implemented a plan to consolidate our palm bay facilities  requiring additional inventory builds 
deteriorating global economic conditions also resulted in reduced demand assumptions for our products in the fourth fiscal quarter of in fiscal year  net inventory charges were million compared to million in fiscal year further fluctuations were largely a function of our sales mix 
operating expenses research and development r d r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and expenses of employees engaged in product process research  design and development activities  as well as related subcontracting activities  prototype development  cost of design tools and technology license agreement expenses 
our r d expenses increased by or million to million in fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year we grew our r d spending primarily through additional employees gained in acquisitions in order to invest in future products and technology essential for long term growth 
our r d expenses increased by to million in fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year while sales declined in fiscal year  we grew our r d spending primarily through additional employees gained in acquisitions in order to invest in future products and technology essential for long term growth 
this growth was partially offset by cost saving initiatives implemented in the fourth fiscal quarter of and decreased incentive accruals resulting from lower sales 
selling  general and administrative sg a sg a expenses consist primarily of salaries and expenses of employees engaged in selling and marketing our products as well as the salaries and expenses required to perform our human resources  finance  information systems  legal  executive and other administrative functions 
our sg a expenses increased by or million to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year the increase in fiscal year was primarily driven by increased sales commissions  compensation expense and increased incentives as sales increased 
our sg a expenses decreased by to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year the decrease in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily driven by restructuring and in process r d charges in fiscal year and reduced compensation expenses in fiscal year  partially offset by the reversal of accrued equity compensation taken as a result of the resignation of our former ceo in fiscal year amortization of purchased intangibles amortization of purchased intangibles was million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the increase in fiscal year was primarily due to purchased intangibles from the acquisition of techwell 
the increase in fiscal year resulted from additional amortization recorded for various acquisitions in fiscal years and our purchased intangibles  which are definite lived assets  are amortized over their useful lives ranging from three to eleven years 
acquisition related costs acquisition related costs were million in fiscal year  primarily due to the acquisition of techwell in the second fiscal quarter of acquisition related costs were million in fiscal year  primarily related to the quellan acquisition in the 
table of contents third fiscal quarter of in fiscal year  acquisition costs were capitalized as part of the purchase price of the acquisitions in accordance with applicable guidance in effect prior to fiscal year impairment of goodwill we perform an annual test of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
in fiscal years and  we recorded no impairment of goodwill based on our analysis 
in fiscal year  we recorded an impairment loss of  million against our goodwill in the fourth fiscal quarter  calculated as the excess of carrying amount of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill in our reporting units 
we perform a goodwill impairment analysis using the two step method on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair market value of the reporting unit 
during fiscal year  we had five reporting units for purposes of the analysis analog and mixed signal  computing  consumer  industrial and communication  and specialty 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test step one is to identify potential impairment 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  no impairment of the goodwill of the reporting unit is indicated and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
however  if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test step two is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
we performed our annual testing for impairment of goodwill as of the beginning of our fourth fiscal quarter of we performed step one for each of our reporting units and determined that three reporting units indicated potential impairment 
we then performed step two  which involves calculating the implied fair value of our goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting units to all of our assets and liabilities other than goodwill including both recognized and unrecognized intangible assets and comparing the residual amount to the carrying value of goodwill 
for the purposes of this analysis  our estimates of fair value were based on an equal weighting of the income approach  which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on the future discounted cash flows  and the market approach  which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on comparable market prices 
the use of projected discounted future results discounted cash flow approach is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future growth and the strategic plan used to manage the underlying business  and also includes a probability weighted expectation as to our future cash flows 
factors requiring significant judgment include assumptions related to future growth rates  discount factors  market multiples and tax rates  among other considerations 
changes in economic and operating conditions that occur after the annual impairment analysis or an interim impairment analysis  and that impact these assumptions  may result in a future goodwill impairment charge 
based on the comparison of the residual amount of goodwill  determined after the allocation of fair value to the reporting unit assets and liabilities  to the carrying value of our goodwill as of october   we recorded an initial goodwill impairment charge of million in the fourth fiscal quarter of further  during the fourth fiscal quarter of  we concluded that sufficient indicators existed to require us to perform another goodwill impairment analysis as of november  we made this determination based upon a combination of factors  including the significant and sustained decline in our market capitalization below our book value  the deteriorating macro economic environment which resulted in a significant decline in customer demand during the fourth quarter of and illiquidity in the overall credit markets 
step one of the analysis as of november  also indicated potential impairment for three of our reporting units and we further performed the step two allocation of the fair value of the reporting units to the reporting units assets and liabilities including both recognized and unrecognized intangible assets 
based on the comparison of the residual amount of goodwill  determined after the allocation of fair value to the reporting unit assets and liabilities  to the carrying value of our goodwill  we recorded an additional impairment charge of million in the fourth fiscal quarter of goodwill was million as of december  if we experience further significant declines in our stock price  market capitalization or future expected cash flows  further significant adverse changes in the business climate or continuing slower growth rates  we may need to perform additional impairment analysis of our goodwill in future periods prior to our annual test in the fourth quarter 
we can provide no assurance that the significant assumptions used in our analysis will not change substantially and any additional analysis could result in additional impairment charges 

table of contents other income and expenses interest income our interest income decreased to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year interest income decreased in fiscal years and due to decreased average cash balances and continued low interest rates 
interest expense and fees our interest expense and fees increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the increase was due to interest and fees on the long term debt agreement entered into during fiscal year to facilitate the acquisition of techwell 
gain loss on deferred compensation investments we have a liability for a non qualified deferred compensation plan 
we maintain a portfolio of approximately million of mutual fund investments and corporate owned life insurance under the plan 
changes in the fair value of the asset are recorded as a gain loss on deferred compensation investments and changes in the fair value of the liability are recorded as a component of compensation expense 
in general  the compensation expense benefit is substantially offset by the gains and losses on the investment 
during fiscal year  we recorded a gain on deferred compensation investments of million and an increase in compensation expense of million 
during fiscal year  we recorded a gain on deferred compensation investments of million and an increase in compensation expense of million 
other than temporary impairment losses during fiscal years  and  we recorded impairment charges of million  million and million  respectively  before taxes  on certain auction rate securities whose decline in fair value was determined to be other than temporary 
the initial million impairment was recorded in our first fiscal quarter of after significant declines in fair value for two consecutive quarters 
in our fourth fiscal quarter of  we further recorded impairment charges of million after global economic conditions deteriorated rapidly and additional securities experienced substantial declines in fair value over two consecutive quarters 
we recorded an additional million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year due to credit rating downgrades in certain of our securities 
we continue to monitor our auction rate securities and intend to hold all of these investments as the anticipated recovery in market value occurs 
income tax expense benefit our income tax expense from continuing operations was million or of pretax income for fiscal year compared to tax expense of million or of pretax income for fiscal year income tax expense for fiscal year included a million charge due primarily to a provision established upon the completion of fieldwork on a multi year irs examination  offset by a tax benefit of million resulting from the donation of a portion of our facilities in palm bay 
income tax expense for fiscal year included a million benefit related to a reversal of the valuation allowance associated with previously recorded impairments on auction rate securities  partially offset by a million charge related to the move of our international headquarters 
excluding these unusual items  the effective tax rates on income from continuing operations were further reduced by a greater portion of income in lower tax jurisdictions 
our income tax expense from continuing operations was million or of pretax income for fiscal year compared to a tax benefit of million or of pretax income for fiscal year income tax expense for fiscal year included a million benefit related to a reversal of the valuation allowance associated with previously recorded impairments on auction rate securities  partially offset by a million charge related to the move of our international headquarters 
in fiscal year  income tax benefit from continuing operations included a million reversal of a previously established unrecognized tax benefit utb due to the expiration of the statute of limitations on the tax years through excluding these unusual items  the effective tax rates on income from continuing operations were further reduced by a greater portion of income in lower tax jurisdictions 
the statute of limitations for the and tax years each expired during the first quarter of our fiscal year expiration for tax year was extended to december  by agreement with the internal revenue service irs and tax year was 
table of contents extended to december  by the irs for relief from multiple hurricanes that affected our florida operations in the statute of limitations for the tax year expired during the third quarter of our fiscal year 
in determining net income  we estimate and exercise judgment in the calculation of tax expense and tax liabilities and in assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of business  the ultimate tax outcome of many transactions and calculations is uncertain  as the calculation of tax liabilities involves the application of complex tax laws in the united states and other jurisdictions 
we recognize liabilities for additional taxes that may be due on tax audit issues based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of those issues 
although we believe the estimates are reasonable  the final outcome may be different than amounts we estimate 
such determinations could have a material impact on the income tax provision  effective tax rate and operating results in the period they occur 
in addition  the effective tax rate reflected in our forward looking statements is based on current enacted tax law 
significant changes in enacted tax law could materially impact our estimates 
discontinued operations and related taxes on discontinued operations in fiscal year  we recorded a tax benefit of million for a reversal of a previously established utb due to the expiration of the statute of limitations on the tax years  and we recognized no income or loss for discontinued operations in fiscal years or backlog our sales are made pursuant to purchase orders that are generally booked up to six months in advance of delivery 
our standard terms and conditions of sale provide that these orders may not be cancelled or rescheduled thirty days prior to the most current crd for standard products and ninety days prior to crd for semi custom and custom products 
backlog is influenced by several factors  including end market demand  pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times 
additionally  we believe backlog can fall faster than consumption rates in periods of weak end market demand since production lead times can be shorter 
conversely  we believe backlog can grow faster than consumption in periods of strong end market demand as production and delivery times increase and some customers may increase orders in excess of their current consumption to reduce their own risk of production disruptions 
our six month backlog was million as of december   million as of january  and million as of january  although not always the case  we believe backlog can be an indicator of performance in the near future 
business outlook when we announced via our fourth fiscal quarter earnings press release filed with our current report on form k on february   we anticipated revenues for the first fiscal quarter to be in the range of to million 
based on this outlook  we expected first fiscal quarter earnings per diluted share between and 
impact of inflation and changing prices the semiconductor industry has  for several decades  experienced a phenomenon of continual decline in sales prices per unit 
this phenomenon brings unique challenges to managing our business 
in order to increase revenues  we must continually introduce new products that support higher sales prices or increase the units of product sold 
this leads to capacity and production management issues and requires a large investment in research and development to regularly introduce new products that are differentiated based on qualities other than price and enable us to increase our average unit selling prices 
at the same time we are faced with many fixed costs in our business that increase at the same rate of general inflation in the economy and must be managed carefully and aggressively in order to maintain operating margins 
these characteristics of revenue pressure from selling price  the need to invest heavily in research and development and inflation prone fixed costs means that earning a reasonable return for our shareholders is challenging 

table of contents contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations the following table sets forth our future contractual obligations as of december  in millions payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years future minimum operating lease commitments open capital asset purchase commitments open raw material purchase commitments interest rate swap agreement principal and interest on long term debt other purchase commitments standby letters of credit total our future minimum lease commitments consist primarily of leases for buildings and other real property 
open capital asset purchase commitments primarily include leasehold improvement  test and production equipment 
open raw material purchase commitments include purchase orders for million for externally produced wafers and the remaining primarily represents minimum purchase requirements as part of a guaranteed capacity agreement with one of our wafer suppliers 
we utilize standby letters of credit primarily to provide security for various contracts or services such as workers compensation million  environmental items million and to provide security for certain vendor relationships 
these standby letters of credit have annual renewals 
off balance sheet arrangements the purchase agreements for certain acquisitions completed in fiscal years and contain provisions requiring the payment of additional consideration to former stockholders if revenue in excess of a base amount is attained within a specified post closing period 
as a result of these provisions  we paid approximately million additional consideration to the former shareholders of zilker labs  inc zilker during fiscal year the amount of the additional consideration was recorded as an increase in goodwill 
the maximum remaining payout under these provisions is million  based on revenue earned through march we do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have current or future material effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements depend on a variety of factors  including but not limited to  the rate of increase or decrease in our existing business base  the success  timing and amount of investment required to bring new products to market  revenue growth or decline  and potential acquisitions 
we believe that we have the financial resources necessary to meet business requirements for the next months  including our dividend program  the requisite capital expenditures for the maintenance of worldwide manufacturing capacity  working capital requirements and potential future acquisitions or strategic investments 
as of december   our total shareholders equity was  million and we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
in addition  we had million in long term debt outstanding see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we had million in long term investments  primarily auction rate securities as of december  these securities are composed of approximately million of insurance related securities  million of corporate credit securities and million of securities collateralized by student loans 
we continue to accrue and receive interest on the securities based on a contractual rate 
the weighted rate is currently approximately basis points above one month libor 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we entered into a million bank term loan with a term of years at a floating interest rate of approximately five percent 
this term loan and existing corporate cash were used to fund our purchase of techwell in the second fiscal quarter of as of december   we were in compliance with all applicable covenants of the debt agreement 

table of contents during the second quarter of fiscal year  we canceled our previously established million revolving credit facility and established a new million revolving credit facility with morgan stanley senior funding  inc as administrative agent and certain other banks 
this credit line increases our available liquidity and enhances our ability to invest in our business 
to date  we have not drawn on the line 
our primary sources and uses of cash during the three fiscal years ended december  are presented in this summarized table in millions year ended december  january  january  sources of cash existing business performance and activities operating activities  including working capital changes exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan proceeds of long term debt proceeds of long term debt  net of fees uses of cash business improvement investments business acquisitions  net capital expenditures  net of sale proceeds repayments of debt repayments of debt returned to shareholders stock repurchases dividends paid cash investment management activities decrease increase in investments and foreign exchange effects net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal year  our operational cash flows were million compared to million in fiscal year  an increase of million  due primarily to the increase in sales 
we received million from the issuance of long term debt  net of fees 
we used approximately million for capital expenditures and million for the acquisitions of techwell and rock 
we repaid million of debt and we returned million to shareholders in the form of dividends 
investment balances were decreased by million in fiscal year  resulting in net cash provided of million overall 
investment balances decreased as certain investments matured 
our aim is to continually improve the cash flows from our existing business activities and return a substantial portion of that cash flow to shareholders 
we continue to maintain and improve our existing business performance with necessary capital expenditures and acquisitions that may further improve our business and return on investment 
cash  stock  debt or a combination may be issued to fund additional acquisitions to grow our business 
our cash  cash equivalents and investments give us the flexibility to return free cash flow to our shareholders while also pursuing business improvement opportunities for our future 
non cash working capital trade accounts receivable  less valuation allowances  increased by million  or  to million as of december  from million as of january  this increase primarily reflects the increase in sales  which increased from levels 
our net inventories increased by million  or  to million as of december  from million as of january  our days of inventory as of december  reflect an inventory correction in our end markets and the resulting decrease in 
table of contents sales experienced in the fourth fiscal quarter of we maintained stock of certain high volume products to ensure our lead times remain within customer expectations 
capital expenditures capital expenditures  net of sales proceeds  were million for fiscal year  million for fiscal year  and million for fiscal year capital expenditures have been focused primarily on the expansion of available capacity for both our wafer and assembly test partners to support continuing unit volume growth 
currently  we expect fiscal year capital expenditures to be comparable to fiscal year proceeds from exercises of stock options and our stock purchase plan cash flow from stock plans exercises of stock options and sales under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp was million in fiscal year  compared to million received in fiscal year and million received in fiscal year we have changed the mix of new share based incentive grants to a larger proportion of restricted and deferred stock units than stock options 
restricted and deferred stock units do not yield cash proceeds from an exercise event as do stock options 
additionally  exercises are decisions of grantees and are influenced by the level of our stock price and by other considerations of grantees 
the recent decline in stock price has resulted in many of our options being underwater with exercise prices in excess of the current stock price 
while the level of cash inflow from exercises is difficult to forecast or control  we believe it will remain a secondary source of cash 
stock repurchases and dividends historically  we have returned cash to shareholders through our stock repurchase and dividend programs 
our previous stock repurchase program expired on december  in october  our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per share of common stock 
the dividend was paid on november  to shareholders of record as of the close of business on november  in february  our board of directors also declared a dividend of per share  paid on february  to shareholders of record as of the close of business on february  transactions with related and certain other parties none critical accounting policies and estimates we consider the following seven accounting estimation processes to be critical to the preparation of our financial statements the allowance for collection losses on trade receivables  distributor  oem and warranty allowances  allowances for excess or obsolete inventory  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill  accounting for income taxes  fair value of equity based compensation  and fair value of investments 
these estimates involve estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective and require certain assumptions that  if incorrect  could create changes  including adverse ones  to our statement of operations and financial position 
allowance for collection losses on trade receivables  or receivables allowance in millions december  january  gross trade receivables receivables allowance other allowances net trade receivables 
table of contents our receivables allowance is used to state trade receivables at a net realizable value or the amount that we estimate will be collected on our gross receivables 
since the amount that we will actually collect on the receivables outstanding cannot be known until the future  we rely primarily on prior experience 
our historical collection losses have been typically infrequent with write offs of trade receivables being well below of sales 
in order to allow for future collection losses that arise from customer accounts that do not currently indicate the inability to pay but could have such an inability in the future  we maintain an allowance based on a month rolling average of write offs  which as of december  was approximately of our gross trade receivables balance 
we also maintain specific allowances for customer accounts that we know may not be collectible for various reasons  such as bankruptcy and other customer liquidity issues 
we analyze our trade receivable portfolio based on the age of each customer s invoice 
in this way  we can identify the accounts that are more likely to have collection problems 
we then provide an allowance for a portion or all of the customer s balance based on our evaluation of the ultimate collectability of the account 
in the fourth fiscal quarter of and first fiscal quarter of  we recorded additional specific allowances totaling million for one customer that was more than days past due 
distributor  oem and warranty allowances  or other allowances allowances for various customer credits are shown in the table above as other allowances 
this is a combination of distributor  original equipment manufacturer oem and warranty allowances 
distributor allowances were million as of december  and january  revenue is generally recognized from sales to our customers  excluding north american distributors  when a product is shipped 
sales to international distributors are made under agreements which provide the distributors certain price protection on a percentage of unsold inventories they hold 
accordingly  distributor allowances are estimates of the amount of price adjustments that will be encountered in the future on inventory held by international distributors as of the balance sheet date 
we rely primarily on historical international distributor transactions to estimate these adjustments 
the international distributor allowances are comprised of two components that are reasonably estimable 
the first component is the price protection allowance  which protects the distributors gross margins in the event of falling prices which are common in semiconductors and other electronic components 
this allowance is based on the relationship of historical credits issued to distributors in relation to historical inventory levels and the price paid by the distributor as applied to current inventory levels 
the second component is a stock rotation allowance  which is based on the percentage of sales made to limited international distributors whereby the distributors can periodically receive a credit for unsold inventory they hold 
specific allowances for our oem customers totaled million as of december   warranty allowances  returns for which there are product performance claims  totaled million as of december  allowances for excess or obsolete inventory  or inventory allowances we record our inventories at the lower of cost or market as described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as the ultimate market value that we will realize through sales on our inventory cannot be known with exact certainty  we rely on past sales experience and future sales forecasts to project it 
in analyzing our inventory levels  we classify certain inventory as either excess or obsolete 
these classifications are maintained for all classes of inventory  although raw materials are seldom deemed excess or obsolete 
we classify inventory as obsolete if we have withdrawn it from the marketplace or if we have had no sales of the product for the past months and no sales forecasted for the next months 
we provide an allowance for of the standard cost of obsolete inventory 
it is our policy to scrap obsolete inventory 
we conduct reviews of excess inventory on a quarterly basis and reserve a significant portion of the standard cost of excess inventory 
we classify inventory as excess if we have quantities of product greater than the amounts we have sold in the past months or have forecasted to sell in the next months 
we typically retain excess inventory until the inventory is sold or reclassified as obsolete 
for all items identified as excess or obsolete  management reviews the individual facts and circumstances  ie competitive landscape  industry economic conditions  product lifecycles and product cannibalization  specific to that inventory 
inventory allowances totaled approximately million on gross inventory of million as of december  and million on gross inventory of million as of january  product demand estimates are a key element in determining inventory allowances 
our estimate of product demand requires significant judgment and is based in part on historical revenue 
historical sales may not accurately predict future demand 
if future demand is ultimately lower than our estimate  we could incur significant additional expenses to provide allowances for and scrap obsolete inventory 

table of contents assessment of recoverability of goodwill we perform an annual assessment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
in fiscal years and  we recorded no impairment of goodwill based on our analysis 
in fiscal year  the annual review indicated a substantial decrease in the fair value of our goodwill based on declining stock prices and lower revenue expectations 
we recorded an impairment charge of approximately  million against goodwill in the fourth fiscal quarter of we will continue to perform a similar review in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if indications of potential impairment exist 
see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
goodwill is tested under a two step method for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit 
as of and for the year ended december   we had two reporting units for purposes of this analysis 
step one is to identify potential impairment 
we compare the calculated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  no impairment of the goodwill of the reporting unit is indicated and step two is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test will be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the amount of impairment loss is the excess of carrying amount of goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
after a goodwill impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill will be the new accounting basis 
significant judgment is involved in the determination of fair value for the above analysis 
our estimates of fair value are based on a combination of the income approach  which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on the future discounted cash flows  and the market approach  which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on comparable market prices 
the use of future discounted cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future growth and the strategic plan used to manage the underlying business 
factors requiring significant judgment include assumptions related to future growth rates  discount factors  market multiples and tax rates  amongst other considerations 
changes in economic and operating conditions that occur after the annual impairment analysis or an interim impairment analysis  and that impact these assumptions  may result in a future goodwill impairment charge 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required to determine worldwide income tax liabilities 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
our effective tax rate and the actual taxes ultimately payable could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates  in the valuation of deferred tax assets  in tax laws or by material audit assessments  which could affect our profitability 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  establish a valuation allowance 
as of december   our net deferred tax asset amounted to million compared to million as of january  as of december   our net valuation allowance was million compared to million as of january  fair value of equity based compensation we calculate the fair value of an equity based compensation grant compensation cost on the date of grant using a lattice method 
the compensation cost is then amortized straight line over the shorter of vesting life or requisite service period 
calculating fair value requires us to estimate certain key assumptions in the valuation model  including expected stock price volatility  the risk free interest rate in the market  the expected life of the stock option granted and annualized dividend yield 
volatility is one of the most significant determinants of fair value 
we estimate our volatility using a blend of estimated price movement activity implied by our traded options and the actual historic volatility of our stock price 
we estimate our expected risk free interest rate by using the zero coupon us treasury rate at the time of the grant related to the expected life of the grant 
expected forfeitures must be estimated to offset the compensation cost expected to be recorded in the financial statements 
we estimate forfeitures for the first year of vesting  based on historical information about turnover for each appropriate employee level 
thereafter  as vesting tiers within an option are more frequent until fully vested  forfeitures are no longer estimated but rather recorded as they actually occur 
we estimate the annualized dividend yield by dividing the current annualized dividend by the closing stock price on the date of grant 

table of contents calculating fair value for our options and deferred stock units that have a performance measurement element to them also requires us to estimate the likely actual performance before the performance is complete 
we do this by adjusting the forfeiture rate to include the expectation of actual performance at the time the calculation is made for purposes of amortizing the compensation appropriately 
such performance based instruments  depending upon the term of required performance  may need to be remeasured as frequently as quarterly 
see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information with regard to our performance based grants 
we base these estimates of key assumptions on historical information using judgment regarding future expectations 
we re examine our assumptions on a regular basis 
when such examinations of the key assumptions lead to significant changes to the calculation inputs  it can have a material effect on the amount of equity based compensation that will be recognized in aggregate or in any period 
this may mean more volatility in our reported earnings due to changes in facts and circumstances surrounding our use of equity compensation 
fair value of investments available for sale and traded securities are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet 
for actively traded securities  we generally rely upon the valuations as provided by the custodian of these assets 
for available for sale securities  such as illiquid auction rate securities and preferred stock  we use the present value of expected future cash flows to determine fair value 
significant judgments are required in the estimation of fair value  including assumptions about the expected holding period  yield  and appropriate discount rates 
we then evaluate each security to determine whether any impairment is temporary or other than temporary 
temporary impairments are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss  while other than temporary impairments are recorded as a component of non operating income 
recent accounting pronouncements fasb asu  fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements in january  the fasb issued guidance to improve the disclosures for level  level and level fair value measurements 
asu requires new disclosures for significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements  and separately report information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements of level fair value measurements 
asu also updates asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  to require an entity to provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities 
entities should also provide disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements for level and level fair value measurements 
asu is currently effective  except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements  which will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  this statement will have no impact on our consolidated results  but will result in additional disclosures on fair value measurements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk global economic conditions pose a risk to the overall economy as consumers and businesses may defer purchases in response to the uncertainty around tighter credit and negative financial news 
these conditions could reduce product demand and affect other related matters 
demand could be different from our expectations due to many factors including changes in business and economic conditions  conditions in the credit market that could affect consumer confidence  customer acceptance of our products  changes in customer order patterns including order cancellations and changes in the level of inventory held by vendors 
credit markets have tightened as a result of the recent financial crises  resulting in lower liquidity in many financial markets and excess volatility in fixed income  credit and equity markets 
we could experience a number of resulting effects  including product delays due to effects experienced by key suppliers  reduced orders and payments as customers are affected by tighter credit markets and or insolvency  decreased investing and financing options in a tighter market  increased expenses  increased impairments resulting from lower orders and sales as customers experience difficulties obtaining financing  and volatility and extreme changes in the earnings and fair value of our investments 
moreover  in the normal course of doing business  we are exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
we employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments  entered into for purposes other than trading purposes  to manage our exposure to these risks 

table of contents our cash equivalents and investments are subject to three market risks interest rate risk  credit risk and liquidity risk 
our investments are primarily held in money market funds  bank time deposits and auction rate securities ars 
some of these investments are insured for credit risk 
ars are subject to substantial risk that the market will fail to provide the opportunity to liquidate on scheduled reset dates 
this risk  which we have encountered with regard to our ars  manifests itself in sponsoring broker dealers withdrawing from the auction process that provides the rate reset and liquidity 
in the first fiscal quarter of  we reclassed our short term auction rate securities to long term due to the sustained illiquidity of these securities 
during fiscal years  and  we recorded million  million and million impairments of ars  respectively 
we further recorded an additional million unrealized loss against other comprehensive income and a related tax benefit of million  for a net unrealized loss of million in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
see notes and in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional quantitative and qualitative details 
as of december   we had open foreign exchange contracts to economically hedge forecasted foreign cash flow commitments up to six months 
as our hedges on forecasted foreign cash flow commitments do not qualify for deferral  gains and losses on changes in the fair market value of the foreign exchange contracts are recognized in income 
realized and unrealized gains and losses from economic hedges are classified in the statements of operations consistent with the accounting classification of the items being economically hedged 
the derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value 
we believe our cash flow hedges have been economically effective 
the table below summarizes our foreign exchange contract activity over the past two years in millions year ended december  january  realized loss on foreign exchange contracts unrealized loss on foreign exchange contracts purchases and sales of foreign exchange contracts notional amount of open contracts as of year end fair value of open contracts as of year end on june   we entered into certain interest rate swap transactions with a notional value of million to hedge a portion of the risk of changes in the benchmark interest rate month libor related to our currently outstanding term loan 
under the terms of the interest rate swaps  we will effectively convert million of our variable rate term loan to fixed interest rates through october  we designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges to hedge the risk of changes in the benchmark interest 
the fair value of the swaps at inception were zero and subsequent changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded in other comprehensive income  net of tax benefit  to the extent they are effective in offsetting the variability of the hedged cash flows 
we hedge against both currency exchange and interest rate risk 
our hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange risks 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of our currency exchange hedging programs include accuracy of sales estimates  volatility of currency markets and the cost and availability of hedging instruments 
a adverse change in currency exchange rates for our foreign currency derivatives held as of december  will have a negligible impact on the fair values of these instruments 
this qualification of exposure to the market risk associated with foreign exchange financial instruments does not take into account the offsetting impact of changes in the fair values of foreign denominated assets  liabilities and firm commitments 
the interest rate swap contracts serve to convert our debt from variable rate to fixed rate 
though the swap contracts were perfectly effective at the time we entered into them  any ineffectiveness in future periods caused by inconsistent cash flows on the debt and the swap contracts could impact earnings 
a adverse change in current interest rates for the swap derivatives held as of december  would have a negligible impact on the fair value of these instruments 
see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
a substantial majority of our revenues billed outside the us are billed and collected in us dollars 
therefore  we do not believe we have material risk to revenues due to currency rate fluctuations between billing and collection of funds for those amounts billed in other currencies
