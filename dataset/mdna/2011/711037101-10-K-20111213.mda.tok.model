item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we have historically operated as a traditional thrift institution 
a significant majority of our assets consist of long term  fixed rate and adjustable rate one to four family residential mortgage loans  which we have funded primarily with retail deposit accounts and federal home loan bank of boston advances 
our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  consisting primarily of loans  investment securities including securities issued by us government agencies and residential mortgage backed securities issued by government sponsored entities and other interest earning assets  primarily interest earning deposits at other financial institutions  and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  consisting primarily of money market accounts  savings accounts  certificates of deposit  and federal home loan bank of boston advances 
our results of operations also are affected by our provisions for loan losses  non interest income and non interest expense 
non interest income currently consists primarily of service charges on deposit accounts  income derived from insurance policies we hold on certain of our executive officers which serve as a funding source for our benefit obligations  loan servicing fees and other income and gains or losses on the sale of loans and on the sale of available for sale securities 
non interest expense currently consists primarily of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  data processing  legal  accounting and exam fees  fdic insurance premiums and other operating expenses 
our results of operations also may be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions  changes in market interest rates  governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
all of our residential mortgage backed securities have been issued or guaranteed by freddie mac  fannie mae or ginnie mae  all of which are us government sponsored entities 
these agencies guarantee the payment of principal and interest on our residential mortgage backed securities 
we do not own any trust preferred securities or collateralized debt obligations cdos 
since september   we have increased our total assets by from million at september  to million at september  during fiscal and  we purchased approximately million of one to four family residential mortgage loans  substantially all of which are higher yielding  jumbo mortgage loans  collateralized by single family properties in our market area 
additionally  during the years ended september  and september   we purchased million and million  respectively  of one to four family residential mortgage loans  substantially all of which are collateralized by single family  owner occupied properties in our market area 
our operations in recent years have also been affected by our efforts to manage our interest rate risk position by reducing our exposure to long term  fixed rate assets and replacing a portion of these assets with adjustable rate loans 
specifically  during the year ended september  we sold million of   and year fixed rate  lower yielding  conforming one to four family residential mortgage loans and we have used the net proceeds of these sales to repay short term borrowings and to fund loan originations and purchases 
we did not sell any available for sale securities during the fiscal year ended september  the low interest rate environment during fiscal  and generated a substantial amount of loan pre payments in our one to four family residential mortgage loan portfolio 
management made the determination to re pay fhlb advances rather than re deploy these funds back in to lower yielding fixed rate loans 
accordingly during fiscal  our fhlb advances decreased to million at september  from million at september  during fiscal  we also continued our emphasis on the origination of commercial real estate loans which generally have 
table of contents adjustable rates  and these loans increased million  or  to million at september  from million at september  we have traditionally focused on the origination of one to four family residential mortgage loans  and on the origination or participation in multi family mortgage loans and commercial real estate loans  and at september   of our loan portfolio was comprised of these types of loans 
we intend to continue to emphasize the origination of these types of loans in the future 
our emphasis on conservative loan underwriting has resulted in relatively low levels of non performing assets at a time when many financial institutions are experiencing significant asset quality issues 
our non performing assets totaled million  or of total assets  at september   compared to million  or of total assets at september   and million or of total assets  at september  total loan delinquencies as of september  were million 
our non performing loans and loss experience has enabled us to maintain a relatively low allowance for loan losses in relation to other peer institutions and correspondingly has resulted in low levels of provisions for loan losses 
our provision for loan losses was   and  for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
we do not offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal  such as option arm loans  where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on his or her loan  resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan 
we generally do not offer subprime loans loans that are made with low down payments to borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies  previous charge offs  judgments and bankruptcies  or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity as evidenced by low credit scores or high debt burden ratios or alt a loans generally defined as loans having less than full documentation 
we do offer interest only loans where the borrower pays only interest for an initial period  after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing loan for the construction of one to four family residential properties  multi family properties which we define as five or more units and commercial properties 
although we participate in fannie mae expanded approval program and freddie mac a minus program  which previously did not require income verification  we still verified income for these  as well as all types of mortgage loans 
critical accounting policies we consider accounting policies that require management to exercise significant judgment or discretion or make significant assumptions that have  or could have  a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income  to be critical accounting policies 
we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the allowance is established through the provision for loan losses  which is charged to income 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment 
among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are the following loss exposure at default  the amount and timing of future cash flows on impacted loans  value of collateral  and determination of loss factors to be applied to the various elements of the portfolio 
all of these estimates are susceptible to significant change 
although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation 
in addition  the office of the comptroller of the currency occ  as an integral part of its examination process  periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses 
the occ may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on its judgments about information available to it at the time of its examination 
the 
table of contents allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that management considers adequate to provide for estimated losses and impairment based upon an evaluation of known and inherent risk in the loan portfolio 
loan impairment is evaluated based on the fair value of collateral or estimated net realizable value 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management evaluation of the estimated losses that have been incurred in our loan portfolio 
it is the policy of management to provide for losses on unidentified loans in its portfolio in addition to classified loans 
management monitors its allowance for loan losses at least quarterly and makes adjustments to the allowance through the provision for loan losses as economic conditions and other pertinent factors indicate 
the quarterly review and adjustment of the qualitative factors employed in the allowance methodology and the updating of historical loss experience allow for timely reaction to emerging conditions and trends 
in this context  a series of qualitative factors are used in a methodology as a measurement of how current circumstances are affecting the loan portfolio 
included in these qualitative factors are levels of past due  classified and non accrual loans  troubled debt restructurings and modifications  nature and volume of loans  changes in lending policies and procedures  underwriting standards  collections and charge offs and recoveries  and for commercial loans  the level of loans being approved with exceptions to policy  national and local economic and business conditions  including various market segments  quality of our loan review system and degree of board of directors oversight  concentrations of credit by industry  geography and collateral type  with a specific emphasis on real estate  and changes in levels of such concentrations  and effect of external factors  including the deterioration of collateral values  on the level of estimated credit losses in the current portfolio 
in determining the allowance for loan losses  management has established both specific allowances and general pooled allowances 
the general pooled allowances are determined by assigning certain qualitative factors and quantitative factors developed from historic loss experience which provide a dynamic basis for the calculation of reserve factors for both pass rated loans general pooled allowance and those criticized and classified loans under asc  receivables loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality subsequent measurement 
the amount of the specific allowance is determined through a loan by loan analysis of certain large dollar loans 
loans not individually reviewed are evaluated as a group using reserve factor percentages based on historic loss experience and the qualitative factors described above 
in determining the appropriate level of the general pooled allowance  management makes estimates based on internal risk ratings  which take into account such factors as debt service coverage  loan to value ratios  and external factors 
estimates are periodically measured against actual loss experience 
as changes in our operating environment occur and as recent loss experience fluctuates  the factors for each category of loan based on type and risk rating will change to reflect current circumstances and the quality of the loan portfolio 
given that the components of the allowance are based partially on historical losses and on risk rating changes in response to recent events  required reserves may trail the emergence of any unforeseen deterioration in credit quality 
although we maintain our allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to provide for the inherent risk of loss in our loan portfolio  if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluations there can be no assurance that future losses will not exceed 
table of contents estimated amounts or that additional provisions for loan losses will not be required in future periods 
accordingly  the current decline in the national economy and the local economies of the areas in which the loans are concentrated could result in an increase in loan delinquencies  foreclosures or repossessions resulting in increased charge off amounts and the need for additional loan loss allowances in future periods 
in addition  our determination as to the amount of our allowance for loan losses is subject to review by the occ  our primary regulator  as part of its examination process  which may result in the establishment of an additional allowance based upon the judgment of the occ after a review of the information available at the time of the occ examination 
a large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance  which would negatively affect earnings 
income taxes 
management considers accounting for income taxes as a critical accounting policy due to the subjective nature of certain estimates that are involved in the calculation 
the bank uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets is established when  in the judgment of management  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
periodically  the company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets 
adjustments to increase or decrease the valuation allowance are generally charged or credited  respectively  to income tax expense 
analysis of net interest income net interest income represents the difference between income on interest earning assets and the expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income depends upon the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them 
the following table sets forth average balance sheets  average yields and costs and certain other information for the periods indicated 
all average balances are daily average balances 
the yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees  and discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or expense 
tax exempt income and yields have not been adjusted to a tax equivalent basis 
the company does not accrue interest on loans on non accrual status  however  the balance of these loans is included in the total average balance  which has the effect of lowering average loan yields

impact of inflation and changing prices our consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration of changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than the effects of inflation 
recent accounting pronouncements footnote in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which is included in item of this report  discusses new accounting pronouncements adopted by the company in fiscal year and the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet required to be adopted 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management general 
our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because  as a financial institution  the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
therefore  a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
our board of directors has established an asset liability management committee  which is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities  for determining the level of risk that is appropriate  given our business strategy  operating environment  capital  liquidity and performance objectives  and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors 
historically  we have operated as a traditional thrift institution 
a significant portion of our assets consist of longer term  fixed and adjustable rate residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities  which we funded primarily with checking and savings accounts and short term borrowings 
in recent years  in an effort to improve our earnings and to decrease our exposure to interest rate risk  we generally have sold long term primarily and year  fixed rate  conforming one to four family residential mortgage loans and we have shifted our focus to originating and purchasing more higher yielding  fixed rate jumbo loans and adjustable rate jumbo loans generally with rates that adjust after the initial years and more commercial real estate loans  which generally have shorter maturities than one to four family residential mortgage loans  and are usually originated with adjustable interest rates 
additionally  to increase our liquidity and further reduce our exposure to interest rate risk  in recent years we have sold a substantial amount of our short term  mortgage backed securities in the relatively low interest rate environment 
in addition to the above strategies with respect to our lending activities  we have used the following strategies to reduce our interest rate risk increasing our money market accounts  which are less rate sensitive than certificates of deposit and which provide us with a stable  low cost source of funds  repaying short term borrowings  and maintaining relatively high levels of capital 
we have not conducted hedging activities  such as engaging in futures  options or swap transactions  or investing in high risk mortgage derivatives  such as collateralized mortgage obligations  residual interests  real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage backed securities 
management of market risk 
market risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in market prices and rates  and typically encompasses exposures such as sensitivity to changes in market interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and commodity prices 
the bank has no exposure to foreign currency exchange or commodity price movements 
because net interest income is the bank primary source of revenue  interest rate risk is a significant market risk to which the bank is exposed 
interest rate risk is the exposure of the bank net interest income in response to movements in interest rates 
net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates as well as by fluctuations in the level and duration of the bank assets and liabilities 
over and above the influence that interest rates have on net interest income  changes in rates may also affect the volume of lending activity  the ability of borrowers to repay variable rate loans  the volume of loan prepayments and refinancing  the availability  mix and cost of deposits and other funding alternatives  and the market value of the bank assets and liabilities 

table of contents exposure to interest rate risk is managed by the bank through periodic evaluations of the current interest rate risk inherent in its rate sensitive assets and liabilities  primarily deposits  borrowings  loans and investment securities  coupled with determinations of the level of risk considered appropriate given the bank capital and liquidity requirements  business strategy and performance objectives 
through such management  the bank seeks to manage the vulnerability of its net interest income to changes in interest rates 
the asset liability committee  alco  comprised of several members of senior management and two members of the board of directors  is responsible for managing interest rate risk 
on a quarterly basis  this committee reviews with the board of directors its analysis of our exposure to interest rate risk  the effect subsequent changes in interest rates could have on the bank future net interest income  key interest rate risk strategies and other activities  and the effect of those strategies on the bank operating results 
this committee is also involved in the bank planning and budgeting process as well as in determining pricing strategies for deposits and loans 
management is aided in these efforts by the use of an independent third party that convenes with management on a quarterly basis for a complete asset liability analysis and review 
the primary method that alco uses for measuring and evaluating interest rate risk is an income simulation analysis 
this analysis considers the maturity and interest rate repricing characteristics of all of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as the relative sensitivities of these balance sheet components over a range of interest rate scenarios 
interest rate scenarios tested generally include parallel and flattening steepening rate ramps over a one year period  and static  or flat  rates 
the simulation analysis is used to measure the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates over a specified time horizon  usually a two year period 
the simulations also show the net interest income volatility for up to five years 
for september   we used a simulation model to project changes for four rate scenarios 
this analysis calculates the difference between net interest income forecasts for these scenarios compared to the net interest income forecast using a flat rate scenario 
in each of these instances  federal funds is used as the driving rate 
the table below sets forth  as of september   the estimated changes in the bank net interest income that would result 
net portfolio value net interest income estimated increase decrease estimated increase decrease change in interest rates basis points estimated npv estimated net interest income amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands bp bp bp bp bp assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities 
npv is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from interest earning assets  interest bearing bearing liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
the income simulation model includes various assumptions regarding the re pricing relationships for each of our products 
many of our assets are floating rate loans tied to the prime rate  which are assumed to re price immediately and to the same extent as the change in market rates  according to 
table of contents their contracted index 
many of these credit relationships  however  now have interest rate floors at above market levels 
many of these loans may not re price with the first couple of increases in short term interest rates 
conversely  we have various transaction account products that would not increase or decrease in the same increments or at the same speed 
money market accounts  as an example  are assumed to increase sooner and in larger increments than savings and now accounts 
these assumptions are based on our prior experience with the changes in rates paid on these non maturity deposits coincident with changes in market interest rates 
the model begins by disseminating data into appropriate repricing buckets 
assets and liabilities are then assigned a multiplier to simulate how much that particular balance sheet item will reprice when interest rates change 
the final step is to simulate the timing effect of assets and liabilities with a month by month simulation to estimate the change in interest income and expense over the next months 
this analysis indicates the impact of changes in net interest income for the given set of rate changes and assumptions 
it does not incorporate any balance sheet growth  and it assumes that the structure and composition of the balance sheet will remain comparable to the structure at the start of the simulation 
it does not account for other factors that might impact this analysis  including changes by management to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes or secondary impacts such as changes to our credit risk profile as interest rates change 
furthermore  loan prepayment rate estimates and spread relationships change regularly 
interest rate changes create changes in actual loan prepayment rates that differ from the market estimates incorporated in this analysis 
changes that vary significantly from the assumptions may have significant effects on our net interest income 
for the rising interest rate scenarios  the base market interest rate forecast was increased  on an instantaneous and sustained basis  by  and basis points 
at september   our net interest income exposure related to these hypothetical changes in market interest rates was within our established guidelines 
there are inherent shortcomings to income simulations  given the number and variety of assumptions that must be made in performing the analysis 
the assumptions relied upon in making these calculations of interest rate sensitivity include the level of market interest rates  the shape of the yield curve  the degree to which certain assets and liabilities with similar attributes react to changes in market interest rates  and the degree to which non maturity deposits  such as checking accounts  react to changes in market rates 
although the analysis shown above provides an indication of the bank sensitivity to interest rate changes at a point in time  these estimates are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the bank net interest income and may differ from actual results 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations 
our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments  advances from the federal home loan bank of boston  principal repayments and loan sales and the sale of available for sale securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
our asset liability management committee  under the direction of our chief financial officer  is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawals of our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies 
we believe that we have enough sources of liquidity to satisfy our short and long term liquidity needs as of september  we regularly monitor and adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of i expected loan demand  
table of contents ii expected deposit flows and borrowing maturities  iii yields available on interest earning deposits and securities  and iv the objectives of our asset liability management program 
excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest earning deposits and short term securities and are also used to pay off short term borrowings 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents 
the level of these assets is dependent on our operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at september   cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
our cash flows are derived from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows included in our consolidated financial statements 
at september   we had million in loan commitments outstanding  million of which were for fixed rate loans and million of which were for adjustable rate loans 
in addition to commitments to originate loans  we had million in unused lines of credit to borrowers 
certificates of deposit due within one year of september  totaled million  or of our certificates of deposits 
if these deposits do not remain with us  we may be required to seek other sources of funds  including loan sales  brokered deposits  repurchase agreements and federal home loan bank advances 
however  recently  we have had cash in excess of our funding needs because of increased loan and investment securities sales and prepayments on longer term  one to four family residential real estate loans  resulting from refinancings with other financial institutions 
depending on market conditions  we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit  or on our money market accounts 
we believe  however  based on historical experience and current market interest rates that we will retain upon maturity a large portion of our certificates of deposit with maturities of one year or less as of september  our primary investing activity is originating loans 
during the fiscal years ended september  and  we originated million and million of loans  respectively 
additionally  during the fiscal year ended september   we purchased million of loans 
financing activities consist primarily of activity in deposit accounts and federal home loan bank advances 
we experienced a net increase in deposits of million for the year ended september  deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by us and our local competitors  and by other factors 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
if we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  borrowing agreements exist with the federal home loan bank of boston  which provide an additional source of funds
