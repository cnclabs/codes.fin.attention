table of contents ebitda is a measure of operating performance that is not calculated in accordance with us gaap 
ebitda should not be considered a substitute for net income  income from operations or cash flows provided by or used in operations  as determined in accordance with us gaap 
ebitda is a key measure of our operating performance used by management to focus on consolidated operating performance exclusive of income and expense that relate to the financing and capitalization of the business 
adjusted net income and adjusted net income plus depreciation and amortization are measures of operating performance that are not calculated in accordance with us gaap 
adjusted net income and adjusted net income plus depreciation and amortization should not be considered a substitute for net income  income from operations or cash flows provided by or used in operations  as determined in accordance with us gaap 
adjusted net income and adjusted net income plus depreciation and amortization are key measures of our operating performance used by management to provide useful information about operating and period over period performance of our business without regard to periodic reporting elements related to interest rate derivative accounting and gains or losses related to flight equipment and debt investments 
we define ebitda as income loss from continuing operations before income taxes  interest expense and depreciation and amortization 
we use ebitda to assess our consolidated financial and operating performance  and we believe this non us gaap measure  is helpful in identifying trends in our performance 
this measure provides an assessment of controllable expenses and affords management the ability to make decisions which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial goals as well as achieve optimal financial performance 
it provides an indicator for management to determine if adjustments to current spending decisions are needed 
ebitda provides us with a measure of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of our capital structure primarily interest charges on our outstanding debt and asset base primarily depreciation and amortization from our operating results 
the table below shows the reconciliation of net income loss to ebitda for the years ended december     and year ended december  dollars in thousands net income depreciation amortization of net lease premiums discounts and lease incentives interest  net income tax provision earnings loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes ebitda management believes that adjusted net income ani and adjusted net income plus depreciation and amortization anida  when viewed in conjunction with the company s results under us gaap and the below reconciliation  provide useful information about operating and period over period performance  and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business without regard to periodic reporting elements related to interest rate derivative accounting and gains or losses related to flight equipment and debt investments 
additionally  management believes that anida provides investors with an additional metric to enhance their understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings from which capital investments are made  debt is serviced  and dividends are paid

overview we are a global company that acquires  leases  and sells high utility commercial jet aircraft to passenger and cargo airlines throughout the world 
high utility aircraft are generally modern  operationally efficient jets with a large operator base and long useful lives 
as of december   our aircraft portfolio consisted of aircraft that were leased to lessees located in countries  and managed through our offices in the united states  ireland and singapore 
typically  our aircraft are subject to net operating leases whereby the lessee is generally responsible for maintaining the aircraft and paying operational  maintenance and insurance costs  although in a majority of cases  we are obligated to pay a portion of specified maintenance or modification costs 
from time to time  we also make investments in other aviation assets  including debt investments secured by commercial jet aircraft 
our revenues and income from continuing operations for the year ended december  were million and million  respectively  and for the fourth quarter were million and million  respectively 
revenues our revenues are comprised primarily of operating lease rentals on flight equipment held for lease  revenue from retained maintenance payments related to lease expirations and lease termination payments and lease incentives amortization 
typically  our aircraft are subject to net operating leases whereby the lessee pays lease rentals and is generally responsible for maintaining the aircraft and paying operational  maintenance and insurance costs  although in a majority of cases  we are obligated to pay a portion of specified maintenance or modification costs 
our aircraft lease agreements generally provide for the periodic payment of a fixed amount of rent over the life of the lease and the amount of the contracted rent will depend upon the type  age  specification and condition of the aircraft and market conditions at the time the lease is committed 
the amount of rent we receive will depend on a number of factors  including the credit worthiness of our lessees and the occurrence of delinquencies  restructurings and defaults 
our lease rental revenues are also affected by the extent to which aircraft are off lease and our ability to remarket aircraft that are nearing the end of their leases in order to minimize their off lease time 
our success in re leasing aircraft is affected by market conditions relating to our aircraft and by general industry conditions and trends 
an increase in the percentage of off lease aircraft or a reduction in lease rates upon remarketing would negatively impact our revenues 
under an operating lease  the lessee will be responsible for performing maintenance on the relevant aircraft and will typically be required to make payments to us for heavy maintenance  overhaul 
table of contents or replacement of certain high value components of the aircraft 
these maintenance payments are based on hours or cycles of utilization or on calendar time  depending upon the component  and would be made either monthly in arrears or at the end of the lease term 
for maintenance payments made monthly in arrears during a lease term  we will typically be required to reimburse all or a portion of these payments to the lessee upon their completion of the relevant heavy maintenance  overhaul or parts replacement 
we record maintenance payments paid by the lessee during a lease as accrued maintenance liabilities in recognition of our obligation in the lease to refund such payments  and therefore we do not recognize maintenance revenue during the lease 
maintenance revenue recognition would occur at the end of a lease  when we are able to determine the amount  if any  by which reserve payments received exceed the amount we are required under the lease to reimburse to the lessee for heavy maintenance  overhaul or parts replacement 
the amount of maintenance revenue we recognize in any reporting period is inherently volatile and is dependent upon a number of factors  including the timing of lease expiries  including scheduled and unscheduled expiries  the timing of maintenance events and the utilization of the aircraft by the lessee 
many of our leases contain provisions which may require us to pay a portion of the lessee s costs for heavy maintenance  overhaul or replacement of certain high value components 
we account for these expected payments as lease incentives  which are amortized as a reduction of revenue over the life of the lease 
we estimate the amount of our portion for such costs  typically for the first major maintenance event for the airframe  engines  landing gear and auxiliary power units  expected to be paid to the lessee based on assumed utilization of the related aircraft by the lessee  the anticipated amount of the maintenance event cost and the estimated amounts the lessee is responsible to pay 
this estimated lease incentive is not recognized as a lease incentive liability at the inception of the lease 
we recognize the lease incentive as a reduction of lease revenue on a straight line basis over the life of the lease  with the offset being recorded as a lease incentive liability which is included in maintenance payments on the balance sheet 
the payment to the lessee for the lease incentive liability is first recorded against the lease incentive liability and any excess above the lease incentive liability is recorded as a prepaid lease incentive asset which is included in other assets on the balance sheet and continues to amortize over the remaining life of the lease 
operating expenses operating expenses are comprised of depreciation of flight equipment held for lease  interest expense  selling  general and administrative expenses  aircraft impairment charges and maintenance and other costs 
because our operating lease terms generally require the lessee to pay for operating  maintenance and insurance costs  our portion of maintenance and other costs relating to aircraft reflected in our statement of income has been nominal  however  to the extent our customers failed to pay operating  maintenance  insurance or transition costs  our portion of these expenses for unscheduled lease terminations reflected in our income statement increased significantly during and to a lesser extent in as compared to prior years 
income tax provision we have obtained an assurance from the minister of finance of bermuda under the exempted undertakings tax protection act that  in the event that any legislation is enacted in bermuda imposing any tax computed on profits or income  or computed on any capital asset  gain or appreciation or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax  such tax shall not  until march   be applicable to us or to any of our operations or to our shares  debentures or other obligations except insofar as such tax applies to persons ordinarily resident in bermuda or to any taxes payable by us in respect of real property owned or leased by us in bermuda 
consequently  the provision for income taxes recorded relates to income earned by certain subsidiaries of the company which are located in  or earn income in  jurisdictions that impose income taxes  primarily ireland and the united states 

table of contents all of our aircraft owning subsidiaries that are recognized as corporations for us tax purposes are us corporations 
these non us subsidiaries generally earn income from sources outside the united states and typically are not subject to us federal  state or local income taxes unless they operate within the us  in which case they may be subject to federal  state and local income taxes 
we also have a u 
s based subsidiary which provides management services to our non us subsidiaries and is subject to non us federal  state and local income taxes 
in addition  those subsidiaries that are resident in ireland are subject to irish tax 
segments we operate in a single segment 
history aircastle limited  formerly aircastle investment limited  is a bermuda exempted company that was incorporated on october  by fortress investment group llc and certain of its affiliates 
acquisitions and disposals we originate acquisitions and disposals through well established relationships with airlines  other aircraft lessors  financial institutions and brokers  as well as other sources 
we believe that sourcing such transactions both globally and through multiple channels provides for a broad and relatively consistent set of opportunities 
our objective is to develop and maintain a diverse and stable operating lease portfolio  however  we review our operating lease portfolio periodically to make opportunistic sales of aircraft and to manage our portfolio diversification 
we also intend to take advantage of sales opportunities during cyclical upturns 
on june   we entered into an acquisition agreement  which we refer to as the airbus a agreement  under which we agreed to acquire new a aircraft  or the new a aircraft  from airbus sas  or airbus 
during each of and  we acquired two new a aircraft 
as of december   we had eight new a aircraft remaining to be delivered  with seven scheduled for delivery in and one in the first of our seven new a aircraft deliveries in occurred in february  and it was immediately placed on lease with south african airways 
in addition to the two new a aircraft we acquired in  we acquired nine other aircraft 
we also sold three aircraft 
during the fourth quarter of  the company received insurance proceeds in the amount of million related to a boeing model aircraft that was on lease and suffered a total loss as a consequence of an incident which occurred in the third quarter of significant damage to the aircraft occurred when the aircraft exited the runway following landing 
no serious injuries resulted and there were no fatalities 
in october  the insurers declared the aircraft a total loss 
the sales and insured loss resulted in a combined pre tax gain of million which is included in other income expense on our consolidated statement of income

finance historically  our debt financing arrangements typically have been secured by aircraft and related operating leases  and in the case of our securitizations and pooled aircraft term financings  the financing parties have limited recourse to aircastle limited 
while such financings have historically been available on reasonable terms given the loan to value profile we have pursued  current market conditions continue to limit the availability of both debt and equity capital 
though financing market conditions have recovered recently and we expect them to continue to improve in time  current market conditions remain difficult with respect to financing mid age  current technology aircraft 
during  we accessed the unsecured debt market for the first time by issuing million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due and used the proceeds to repay a secured term loan and to provide funding for incremental aircraft acquisitions 
we also secured a million unsecured revolving credit facility which remains undrawn 
during the near term  we intend to focus our efforts on investment opportunities that are attractive on an unleveraged basis  that tap commercial financial capacity where it is accessible on reasonable terms or for which debt financing that benefits from government guarantees either from the ecas or from exim is available 
we intend to fund new investments through cash on hand and potentially through medium to longer term financings on a secured or unsecured basis 
we may repay all or a portion of such borrowings from time to time with the net proceeds from subsequent long term debt financings  additional equity offerings or cash generated from operations 
therefore  our ability to execute our business strategy  particularly the acquisition of additional commercial jet aircraft or other aviation assets  depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain additional debt and equity capital on terms we deem attractive

the increase in lease rental revenue of million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was primarily the result of million of revenue from eleven new aircraft purchased in and the full year revenue from two new aircraft purchased during this increase was offset partially by a decrease in revenue of million of revenue due to five aircraft sold in  million of revenue due to lease extensions and transitions at lower rentals  and million of revenue due to lower floating rate lease rentals and other changes 

table of contents amortization of net lease discounts and lease incentives 
year ended december  dollars in thousands amortization of lease discounts amortization of lease premiums amortization of lease incentives amortization of net lease discounts and lease incentives the decrease in amortization of lease discounts and lease premiums for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in is due to scheduled lease expirations of previously acquired leases  lease extensions and early lease transitions 
as more fully described above under revenues  lease incentives represent our estimated portion of the lessee s cost for heavy maintenance  overhaul or replacement of certain high value components which is amortized over the life of the related lease 
as we enter into new leases  the amortization of lease incentives generally increases and conversely if a related lease terminates  the related unused lease incentive liability will reduce the amortization of lease incentives 
the increase in amortization of lease incentives of million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in results from an increase in amortization of net lease incentives for aircraft transitions and extensions during and the full year impact for aircraft transitions during maintenance revenue

summary of impairments we had no impairments in in the year ended december   we recognized an impairment of million related to two boeing model aircraft and two boeing model aircraft  which was triggered by the early termination of the related leases and the resulting change to estimated future cash flows 
the company received million  of which million represented lease termination payments and million related to maintenance revenue from the 
table of contents previous lessees of these aircraft 
these lease termination payments were recorded as other revenue during the year ended december  in the year ended december   we recognized an impairment of million related to one boeing model aircraft and one boeing model aircraft  which was triggered by the early termination of one of the related leases  a signed forward sales agreement for the other aircraft and the resulting change to estimated future cash flows 
the company recorded million related to maintenance revenue from the previous lessees at the end of the lease of the aircraft that is subject to a forward sales agreement and million related to maintenance revenue from the lessee of one of these aircraft during the year ended december  we perform a recoverability assessment of all aircraft in our fleet  on an aircraft by aircraft basis  at least annually 
we performed this recoverability assessment during the third quarter of other than the aircraft discussed above  management believes that the net book value of each aircraft is currently supported by the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by each aircraft  and as such  these aircraft are not impaired at december  in monitoring the aircraft in our fleet for impairment charges  we identify those aircraft that are most susceptible to failing the recoverability assessment and monitor those aircraft more closely  which may result in more frequent recoverability assessments 
the recoverability in the value of these aircraft is more sensitive to changes in contractual cash flows  future cash flow estimates and residual values or scrap values for each aircraft 
these are typically older aircraft for which lessee demand is declining 
as of december   we had identified ten aircraft as being susceptible to failing the recoverability test 
these aircraft had a combined net book value of million at december  management believes that the net book value of each of these aircraft is currently supported by the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by each aircraft  and as such  these aircraft are not impaired at december  
table of contents application of critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
our estimates and assumptions are based on historical experiences and currently available information 
actual results may differ from such estimates under different conditions  sometimes materially 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is presented in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most subjective judgments  estimates and assumptions 
our most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
lease revenue recognition our operating lease rentals are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
we will neither recognize revenue nor record a receivable from a customer when collectability is not reasonably assured 
estimating whether collectability is reasonably assured requires some level of subjectivity and judgment 
when collectability is not reasonably assured  the customer is placed on non accrual status and revenue is recognized when cash payments are received 
management determines whether customers should be placed on non accrual status 
when we are reasonably assured that payments will be received in a timely manner  the customer is placed on accrual status 
the accrual non accrual status of a customer is maintained at a level deemed appropriate based on factors such as the customer s credit rating  payment performance  financial condition and requests for modifications of lease terms and conditions 
events or circumstances outside of historical customer patterns can also result in changes to a customer s accrual status 
maintenance payments and maintenance revenue under our leases  the lessee must pay operating expenses accrued or payable during the term of the lease  which would normally include maintenance  overhaul  fuel  crew  landing  airport and navigation charges  certain taxes  licenses  consents and approvals  aircraft registration and insurance premiums 
typically  our aircraft are subject to net operating leases whereby the lessee pays lease rentals and is generally responsible for maintaining the aircraft and paying operational  maintenance and insurance costs  although in a majority of cases  we are obligated to pay a portion of specified maintenance or modification costs 
our aircraft lease agreements generally provide for the periodic payment of a fixed amount of rent over the life of the lease and the amount of the contracted rent will depend upon the type  age  specification and condition of the aircraft and market conditions at the time the lease is committed 
the amount of rent we receive will depend on a number of factors  including the credit worthiness of our lessees and the occurrence of delinquencies  restructurings and defaults 
our lease rental revenues are also affected by the extent to which aircraft are off lease and our ability to remarket aircraft that are nearing the end of their leases in order to minimize their off lease time 
our success in re leasing aircraft is affected by market conditions relating to our aircraft and by general industry conditions and trends 
an increase in the percentage of off lease aircraft or a reduction in lease rates upon remarketing would negatively impact our revenues 
under an operating lease  the lessee will be responsible for performing maintenance on the relevant aircraft and will typically be required to make payments to us for heavy maintenance  overhaul or replacement of certain high value components of the aircraft 
these maintenance payments are based on hours or cycles of utilization or on calendar time  depending upon the component  and would be made either monthly in arrears or at the end of the lease term 
for maintenance payments made monthly in arrears during a lease term  we will typically be required to reimburse all or a portion of these payments to the lessee upon completion of the relevant heavy maintenance  overhaul or parts replacement 
we record maintenance payments paid by the lessee during a lease as accrued 
table of contents maintenance liabilities in recognition of our obligation in the lease to refund such payments  and therefore we do not recognize maintenance revenue during the lease 
maintenance revenue recognition would occur at the end of a lease  when we are able to determine the amount  if any  by which reserve payments received exceed the amount we are required under the lease to reimburse to the lessee for heavy maintenance  overhaul or parts replacement 
the amount of maintenance revenue we recognize in any reporting period is inherently volatile and is dependent upon a number of factors  including the timing of lease expiries  including scheduled and unscheduled expiries  the timing of maintenance events and the utilization of the aircraft by the lessee 
lease incentives and amortization many of our leases contain provisions which may require us to pay a portion of the lessee s costs for heavy maintenance  overhaul or replacement of certain high value components 
we account for these expected payments as lease incentives  which are amortized as a reduction of revenue over the life of the lease 
we estimate the amount of our portion for such costs  typically for the first major maintenance event for the airframe  engines  landing gear and auxiliary power units  expected to be paid to the lessee based on assumed utilization of the related aircraft by the lessee  the anticipated amount of the maintenance event cost and the estimated amounts the lessee is responsible to pay 
this estimated lease incentive is not recognized as a lease incentive liability at the inception of the lease 
we recognize the lease incentive as a reduction of lease revenue on a straight line basis over the life of the lease  with the offset being recorded as a lease incentive liability which is included in maintenance payments on the balance sheet 
the payment to the lessee for the lease incentive liability is first recorded against the lease incentive liability and any excess above the lease incentive liability is recorded as a prepaid lease incentive asset which is included in other assets on the balance sheet and continues to amortize over the remaining life of the lease 
flight equipment held for lease and depreciation flight equipment held for lease is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight line method  typically over a year life from the date of manufacture for passenger aircraft and over a year life for freighter aircraft  depending on whether the aircraft is a converted or purpose built freighter  to estimated residual values 
estimated residual values are generally determined to be approximately of the manufacturer s estimated realized price for passenger aircraft when new and for freighter aircraft when new 
management may make exceptions to this policy on a case by case basis when  in its judgment  the residual value calculated pursuant to this policy does not appear to reflect current expectations of value 
examples of situations where exceptions may arise include but are not limited to flight equipment where estimates of the manufacturer s realized sales prices are not relevant eg  freighter conversions  flight equipment where estimates of the manufacturers realized sales prices are not readily available  and flight equipment which may have a shorter useful life due to obsolescence 
in accounting for flight equipment held for lease  we make estimates about the expected useful lives  the fair value of attached leases  acquired maintenance liabilities and the estimated residual values 
in making these estimates  we rely upon actual industry experience with the same or similar aircraft types and our anticipated utilization of the aircraft 
as part of our due diligence review of each aircraft we purchase  we prepare an estimate of the expected maintenance payments and any excess costs which may become payable by us  taking into consideration the then current maintenance status of the aircraft and the relevant provisions of any existing lease 
for planned major maintenance activities for aircraft off lease  the company capitalizes the actual maintenance costs by applying the deferral method 
under the deferral method  we capitalize the 
table of contents actual cost of major maintenance events  which are depreciated on a straight line basis over the period until the next maintenance event is required 
when we acquire an aircraft with a lease  determining the fair value of attached leases requires us to make assumptions regarding the current fair values of leases for specific aircraft 
we estimate a range of current lease rates of like aircraft in order to determine if the attached lease is within a fair value range 
if a lease is below or above the range of current lease rates  we present value the estimated amount below or above fair value range over the remaining term of the lease 
the resulting lease discount or premium is amortized into lease rental income over the remaining term of the lease 
impairment of flight equipment we perform a recoverability assessment of all aircraft in our fleet  on an aircraft by aircraft basis  at least annually 
in addition  a recoverability assessment is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances  or indicators  indicate that the carrying amount or net book value of an asset may not be recoverable 
indicators may include  but are not limited to  a significant lease restructuring or early lease termination  significant air traffic decline  the introduction of newer technology aircraft or engines  an aircraft type is no longer in production or a significant airworthiness directive is issued 
when we perform a recoverability assessment  we measure whether the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the aircraft exceed its net book value 
the undiscounted cash flows consist of cash flows from currently contracted leases  future projected lease rates  transition costs  estimated down time and estimated residual or scrap values for an aircraft 
in the event that an aircraft does not meet the recoverability test  the aircraft will be adjusted to fair value  resulting in an impairment charge 
see further discussion under fair value measurements below 
management develops the assumptions used in the recoverability analysis based on its knowledge of active lease contracts  current and future expectations of the global demand for a particular aircraft type and historical experience in the aircraft leasing market and aviation industry  as well as information received from third party industry sources 
the factors considered in estimating the undiscounted cash flows are impacted by changes in future periods due to changes in contracted lease rates  residual values  economic conditions  technology  airline demand for a particular aircraft type and many of the risk factors discussed in item a 
risk factors 
derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business we utilize derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate risks 
all interest rate derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value 
we determine fair value for our united states dollar denominated interest rate derivatives by calculating reset rates and discounting cash flows based on cash rates  futures rates and swap rates in effect at the period close 
we determine the fair value of our united states dollar denominated guaranteed notional balance interest rate derivatives based on the upper notional band using cash flows discounted at relevant market interest rates in effect at the period close 
the changes in fair values related to the effective portion of the interest rate derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet 
the ineffective portion of the interest rate derivative is calculated and recorded in interest expense on our consolidated statement of income at each quarter end 
for any interest rate derivatives not designated as a hedge  all mark to market adjustments are recognized in other income expense on our consolidated statement of income 
at inception of the hedge  we choose a method to assess effectiveness and to calculate ineffectiveness  which we must use for the life of the hedge relationship 
historically  we have designated the change in variable cash flows method for calculation of hedge ineffectiveness 
this methodology  which is only available for interest rate derivatives designated at execution with a fair value of zero  involves a comparison of the present value of the cumulative change in the expected future cash flows on the variable leg of the interest rate derivative against the present value of the cumulative change in the expected future interest cash flows on the floating rate liability 
when the change in the interest 
table of contents rate derivative s variable leg exceeds the change in the liability  the calculated ineffectiveness is recorded in interest expense on our consolidated statement of income 
effectiveness is tested by dividing the change in the interest rate derivative s variable leg by the change in the liability 
we used the hypothetical trade method for hedge relationships designated after execution because those hedge relationships did not have an interest rate derivative fair value of zero  and therefore  did not qualify for the change in variable cash flow method 
the hypothetical trade method involves a comparison of the change in the fair value of an actual interest rate derivative to the change in the fair value of a hypothetical interest rate derivative with critical terms that reflect the hedged debt 
when the change in the value of the interest rate derivative exceeds the change in the hypothetical interest rate derivative  the calculated ineffectiveness is recorded in interest expense on our consolidated statement of income 
the effectiveness of these relationships is tested by regressing historical changes in the interest rate derivative against historical changes in the hypothetical interest rate derivative 
fair value measurements we measure the fair value of interest rate derivative assets and liabilities on a recurring basis 
fair value is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
our valuation model for interest rate derivatives classified in level maximizes the use of observable inputs  including contractual terms  interest rate curves  cash rates and futures rates and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs  including an assessment of the risk of non performance by the interest rate derivative counterparty in valuing derivative assets  an evaluation of the company s credit risk in valuing derivative liabilities and an assessment of market risk in valuing the derivative asset or liability 
we use our interest rate derivative counterparty s valuation of our interest rate derivatives to validate our models 
our interest rate derivatives are sensitive to market changes in libor as discussed in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our valuation model for interest rate derivatives classified in level includes a significant unobservable market input to value the option component of the guaranteed notional balance 
the guaranteed notional balance has an upper notional band that matches the hedged debt on term financing no 
and a lower notional band 
the notional balance is guaranteed to match the hedged debt balance if the debt balances decrease within the upper and lower notional band 
the range of the guaranteed notional between the upper and lower band represents an option that may not be exercised independently of the debt notional balance 
the fair value of the interest rate derivative is determined based on the upper notional band using cash flows discounted at the relevant market interest rates in effect at the period close and incorporates an assessment of the risk of non performance by the interest rate derivative counterparty in valuing derivative assets  an evaluation of the company s credit risk in valuing derivative liabilities and an assessment of market risk in valuing the derivative asset or liability 
we also measure the fair value of aircraft on a non recurring basis when us gaap requires the application of fair value  including events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amounts of aircraft may not be recoverable 
we principally use the income approach to measure the fair value of these assets 
the income approach is based on the present value of cash flows from contractual lease agreements and projected future lease payments  net of expenses  which extend to the end of the aircraft s economic life in its highest and best use configuration  as well as a disposal value based on expectations of market participants 
income taxes aircastle uses an asset and liability based approach in accounting for income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement and tax basis of existing assets and liabilities using enacted rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
a valuation 
table of contents allowance is established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount estimated by us to be realizable 
the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities 
we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits 
recent accounting pronouncements effective january   the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards update asu asu  consolidations topic improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities  which requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest  or interests  give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
the determination of whether a reporting entity is required to consolidate another entity is based on  among other things  the other entity s purpose and design and the reporting entity s ability to direct the activities of the other entity that most significantly impact the other entity s economic performance 
this asu amends certain guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity and requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
asu requires a reporting entity to provide additional disclosures about its involvement with variable interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued asu asu  fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements  which requires new disclosures to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers  and in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level  to present separately information about purchases  sales issuances  and settlements on a gross basis rather than as one net number 
asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward to activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued an exposure draft  leases lease ed  which would replace the existing guidance in accounting standard codification asc  leases 
under the lease ed  a lessor would be required to adopt a right of use model where the lessor would apply one of two approaches to each lease based on whether the lessor retains exposure to significant risks or benefits associated with the underlying asset 
for the lessor  the right of use model records a right to receive lease payment lease receivable and a lease liability  for the obligation to permit the lessee to use the underlying asset 
the comment period for the lease ed ended on december  and a final standard is expected to be issued in the second quarter of a final standard may have an effective date no earlier than when and if the proposed guidance becomes effective  it may have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity currently are cash on hand  cash generated by our aircraft leasing operations and loans secured by new aircraft we acquire and unsecured borrowings 
our business is very capital intensive  requiring significant investments in order to expand our fleet during periods of growth and investments in maintenance and improvements on our existing portfolio 
our business also generates a significant amount of cash from operations  primarily from lease rentals and maintenance collections 
these sources have historically provided liquidity for these investments and for other uses  
table of contents including the payment of dividends to our shareholders 
in the past  we have also met our liquidity and capital resource needs by utilizing several sources  including lines of credit  our securitizations  term financings and  more recently  secured borrowings supported by export credit agencies for new aircraft acquisitions  unsecured indebtedness  including an unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes  public offerings of common shares  and asset sales 
going forward  we expect to continue to seek liquidity from these sources subject to pricing and conditions that we consider satisfactory 
in june  we closed a million pre delivery payment financing loan facility from sumitomo mitsui banking corporation smbc with respect to six new airbus a passenger aircraft scheduled for delivery on long term leases to saa during as of december   we had drawn down million under this facility 
in july  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due the notes were issued at of par and were offered only to qualified institutional buyers and buyers outside the united states in accordance with rule a and regulation s  respectively  under the securities act of we used a portion of the net proceeds of the private placement to repay million drawn under a credit facility used in connection with the purchase of the first a slb aircraft and used the remaining net proceeds to repay all of the outstanding indebtedness under our term financing no 
and for general corporate purposes  including the purchase of aviation assets 
in october we completed an exchange offer registered under the securities act whereby all the privately placed notes were exchanged for registered notes having terms substantially identical to the privately placed notes 
in september  we entered into a million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with citigroup global markets inc which has a three year term 
as of december   we had not drawn down on this facility 
in addition  in july  we secured new financing commitments which will benefit from an eca guarantee provided by compagnie francaise d assurance pour le commerce exterieur  or coface  as follows smbc committed million in debt to finance the first three new a aircraft  citibank  na committed approximately million to finance three new a aircraft of which we borrowed for the delivery of one new a aircraft in august  and the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj  ltd 
botm committed approximately million to finance three new a aircraft of which we borrowed million for the delivery of one new a aircraft in november during the twelve months ended december   we funded million of pre delivery payments including buyer furnished equipment on our new a aircraft 
as described above  we also drew down million under the pre delivery payment financing loan to refinance certain pre delivery payments made to airbus 
in  we are scheduled to take delivery of seven new a aircraft 
based on our existing funding commitments described above and previously funded pre delivery payments  we expect that the seven new a aircraft deliveries in will require funding from us of approximately million 

table of contents under the terms of securitization no 
 if we do not refinance this facility by june   all cash flows available after expenses and interest will be applied to debt amortization after that date 
assuming we do not refinance this facility by june   we expect that debt amortization payments over the next twelve months will be approximately million dollars compared to million over the months ended december  in addition  as of december   we expect capital expenditures and lessee maintenance payment draws on our aircraft portfolio during to be approximately million to million  excluding purchase obligation payments  and we expect maintenance collections from lessees on our owned aircraft portfolio to be approximately equal to the expected expenditures and draws over the next twelve months 
there can be no assurance that the capital expenditures  our contributions to maintenance events and lessee maintenance payment draws described above will not be greater than expected or that our expected maintenance payment collections or disbursements will equal our current estimates 
in march  we completed the annual maintenance adjusted appraisal for the term financing no 
portfolio and determined that we expect to be in compliance with the loan to value ratio on the april payment date 
in march  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s common shares 
under the program  the company may purchase its common shares from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
the amount and timing of the purchases will depend on a number of factors including the price and availability of the company s common shares  trading volume and general market conditions 
the company may also from time to time establish a trading plan under rule b of the securities exchange act of to facilitate purchases of its common shares under this authorization 
while the financing structures for our securitizations and certain of our term financings include liquidity facilities  these liquidity facilities are primarily designed to provide short term liquidity to enable the financing vehicles to remain current on principal and interest payments during periods when the relevant entities incur substantial unanticipated expenditures 
because these facilities have priority in the payment waterfall and therefore must be repaid quickly  and because we do not anticipate being required to draw on these facilities to cover operating expenses  we do not view these liquidity facilities as an important source of liquidity for us 
we believe that cash on hand  funds generated from operations  maintenance payments received from lessees  proceeds from contracted aircraft sales and funds we expect to borrow upon delivery of the new a aircraft we acquire in future periods  including borrowings under export credit agency supported loan facilities  will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity and capital resource needs over the next twelve months 
our liquidity and capital resource needs include pre delivery payments under the airbus a agreement  payments for buyer furnished equipment  payments due at delivery of the new a aircraft  payments due under our other aircraft purchase commitments  required principal and interest payments under our long term debt facilities  as well as repayments under our a pdp facility  expected capital expenditures  lessee maintenance payment draws and lease incentive payments over the next twelve months

if the debt service coverage ratio requirements are not met on two consecutive monthly payment dates  all excess cash flows will thereafter be applied to prepay the principal balance of the loans until such time as the debt service coverage ratio exceeds the minimum level 
compliance with these covenants depends substantially upon the appraised value of the aircraft securing term financing no

we refer to any prepayments of principal following noncompliance with the loan to value or debt service coverage ratios as supplemental principal payments 
a maintenance adjusted appraisal of term financing no 
portfolio must be completed each year before a date in early may by a specified appraiser

at december   we had aircraft purchase agreements including the acquisition of eight new a aircraft from airbus 
capital expenditures we make capital expenditures from time to time in connection with improvements made to our aircraft 
these expenditures include the cost of major overhauls necessary to place an aircraft in service and modifications made at the request of lessees 
for the years ended december   and  we incurred a total of million  million and million  respectively  of capital expenditures including lease incentives related to the acquisition and improvement of aircraft 
as of december   the weighted average age by net book value of our aircraft was approximately years 
in general  the costs of operating an aircraft  including maintenance expenditures  increase with the age of the aircraft 
under our leases  the lessee is primarily responsible for maintaining the aircraft 
we may incur additional maintenance and modification costs in the future in the event we are required to remarket an aircraft or a lessee fails to meet its maintenance obligations under the lease agreement 
at december   we had a million maintenance payment liability on our balance sheet which is an million increase from the increase primarily consisted of net maintenance cash inflows of million and lease incentive liabilities of million 
these maintenance reserves are paid by the lessee to provide for future maintenance events 
provided a lessee performs scheduled maintenance of the aircraft  we are required to reimburse the lessee for scheduled maintenance payments 
in certain cases  we are also required to make lessor contributions  in excess of amounts a lessee may have paid  towards the costs of maintenance events performed by or on behalf of the lessee 
actual maintenance payments to us by lessees in the future may be less than projected as a result of a number of factors  including defaults by the lessees 
maintenance reserves may not cover the entire amount of actual maintenance expenses incurred and  where these expenses are not otherwise covered by the lessees  there can be no assurance that our operational cash flow and maintenance reserves will be sufficient to fund maintenance requirements  particularly as our aircraft age 
see item a 
risk factors risks related to our leases if lessees are unable to fund their maintenance obligations on our aircraft  our cash flow and our ability to meet our debt obligations or to pay dividends on our common shares could be adversely affected

for the year ended december   expenses  such as payroll and office costs  denominated in currencies other than the us dollar aggregated approximately million in us dollar equivalents and represented approximately of total selling  general and administrative expenses 
our international operations are a significant component of our business strategy and permit us to more effectively source new aircraft  service the aircraft we own and maintain contact with our lessees 
therefore  it is likely that our international operations and our exposure to foreign currency risk will increase over time 
although we have not yet entered into foreign currency hedges because our exposure to date has not been significant  if our foreign currency exposure increases we may enter into hedging transactions in the future to mitigate this risk 
for the years ended december   and  we incurred insignificant net gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 
hedging the objective of our hedging policy is to adopt a risk averse position with respect to changes in interest rates 
accordingly  we have entered into a number of interest rate derivatives to hedge the current and expected future interest rate payments on our variable rate debt 
interest rate derivatives are agreements in which a series of interest rate cash flows are exchanged with a third party over a prescribed period

historically  the company acquired its aircraft using short term credit facilities and equity 
the short term credit facilities were refinanced by securitizations or term debt facilities secured by groups of aircraft 
the company completed two securitizations and two term financings during the period through the company entered into interest rate derivatives to hedge interest payments on variable rate debt for acquired aircraft as well as aircraft that it expected to acquire within certain future periods 
in conjunction with its financing strategy  the company used interest rate derivatives for periods ranging from to years to fix the interest rates on the variable rate debt that it incurred to acquire aircraft in anticipation of the expected securitization or term debt re financings 
at the time of each re financing  the initial interest rate derivatives were terminated and new interest rate derivatives were executed as required by each specific debt financing 
at the time of each interest rate derivative termination  certain interest rate derivatives were in a gain position and others were in a loss position 
since the hedged interest payments for the variable rate debt associated with each terminated interest rate derivative were probable of occurring  the gain or loss was deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is being amortized into interest expense over the relevant period for each interest rate derivative 
prior to the securitizations and term debt financings  our interest rate derivatives typically required us to post cash collateral to the counterparty when the value of the interest rate derivative exceeded a defined threshold 
when the interest rate derivatives were terminated and became part of a larger 
table of contents aircraft portfolio financing  there were no cash collateral posting requirements associated with the new interest rate derivative 
as of december   we did not have any cash collateral pledged under our interest rate derivatives  nor do we have any existing agreements that require cash collateral postings 
generally  our interest rate derivatives are hedging current interest payments on debt and future interest payments on long term debt 
in the past  we have entered into forward starting interest rate derivatives to hedge the anticipated interest payment on long term financings 
these interest rate derivatives were terminated and new  specifically tailored interest rate derivatives were entered into upon closing of the relevant long term financing 
we have also early terminated interest rate derivatives in an attempt to manage our exposure to collateral calls

margin calls as of december  and  none of our interest rate derivatives were subject to margin calls and we had no repurchase agreements 
historically  our interest rate derivatives and repurchase agreements were  in some cases  subject to margin calls based on the value of the underlying security and the level of interest rates 
margin calls resulting from decreases in the value of our debt instruments or mark to market losses on our derivative instruments due to decreasing interest rates required that we post additional collateral 
as discussed in hedging above  we terminated certain interest rate derivatives to limit our exposure to these margin calls and therefore we have no future liquidity exposure to these terminated interest rate contracts 
in addition  we terminated the repurchase agreement in early inflation inflation affects our lease rentals  asset values and costs  including sg a expenses and other expenses 
inflation generally would be expected to create upward pressure on lease rentals and asset 
table of contents values and increase the price of the airframes and engines we purchase under the airbus a agreement  although we have agreed with the manufacturers to certain limitations on price escalation in order to reduce our exposure to inflation

we do not believe that our financial results have been  or will be  adversely affected by inflation in a material way 
management s use of ebitda we define ebitda as income loss from continuing operations before income taxes  interest expense  and depreciation and amortization 
we use ebitda to assess our consolidated financial and operating performance  and we believe this non us gaap measure is helpful in identifying trends in our performance 
this measure provides an assessment of controllable expenses and affords management the ability to make decisions which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial goals as well as achieving optimal financial performance 
it provides an indicator for management to determine if adjustments to current spending decisions are needed 
ebitda provides us with a measure of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of our capital structure primarily interest charges on our outstanding debt and asset base primarily depreciation and amortization from our operating results 
accordingly  this metric measures our financial performance based on operational factors that management can impact in the short term  namely the cost structure  or expenses  of the organization 
ebitda is one of the metrics used by senior management and the board of directors to review the consolidated financial performance of our business 
the table below shows the reconciliation of net income to ebitda for the years ended december   and  respectively 
year ended december  dollars in thousands net income depreciation amortization of net lease discounts and lease incentives interest  net income tax provision ebitda management s use of adjusted net income and adjusted net income plus depreciation and amortization management believes that adjusted net income ani and adjusted net income plus depreciation and amortization anida  when viewed in conjunction with the company s results under us gaap and the below reconciliation  provide useful information about operating and period over period performance  and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business without regard to periodic reporting elements related to interest rate derivative accounting and gains or losses related to flight equipment and debt investments 
additionally  management believes that anida provides investors with an additional metric to enhance their understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings from which capital investments are made  debt is serviced  and dividends are paid

limitations of ebitda  ani and anida an investor or potential investor may find ebitda  ani and anida important measures in evaluating our performance  results of operations and financial position 
we use these non us gaap measures to supplement our us gaap results in order to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 
ebitda  ani and anida have limitations as analytical tools and should not be viewed in isolation or as substitutes for us gaap measures of earnings 
material limitations in making the adjustments to our earnings to calculate ebitda  ani and anida  and using these non us gaap measures as compared to us gaap net income  income from continuing operations and cash flows provided by or used in operations  include depreciation and amortization  though not directly affecting our current cash position  represent the wear and tear and or reduction in value of our aircraft  which affects the aircraft s availability for use and may be indicative of future needs for capital expenditures  the cash portion of income tax benefit provision generally represents charges gains  which may significantly affect our financial results  
table of contents elements of our interest rate derivative accounting may be used to evaluate the effectiveness of our hedging policy  and gains and losses from asset sales  which may not reflect the overall financial return of the asset  may be an indicator of the current value of our portfolio of assets 
ebitda  ani  and anida are not alternatives to net income  income from operations or cash flows provided by or used in operations as calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap 
you should not rely on these non us gaap measures as a substitute for any such us gaap financial measure 
we strongly urge you to review the reconciliations to us gaap net income  along with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
we also strongly urge you to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business 
in addition  because ebitda  ani and anida are not measures of financial performance under us gaap and are susceptible to varying calculations  ebitda  ani and anida  as presented in this annual report  may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in the level of interest rates and the spread between different interest rates 
these risks are highly sensitive to many factors  including us monetary and tax policies  us and international economic factors and other factors beyond our control 
we are exposed to changes in the level of interest rates and to changes in the relationship or spread between interest rates 
our primary interest rate exposures relate to our lease agreements  floating rate debt obligations and interest rate derivatives 
rent payments under our aircraft lease agreements typically do not vary during the term of the lease according to changes in interest rates 
however  our borrowing agreements generally require payments based on a variable interest rate index  such as libor 
therefore  to the extent our borrowing costs are not fixed  increases in interest rates may reduce our net income by increasing the cost of our debt without any corresponding increase in rents or cash flow from our securities 
changes in interest rates may also impact our net book value as our interest rate derivatives are periodically marked to market through shareholders equity 
generally  we are exposed to loss on our fixed pay interest rate derivatives to the extent interest rates decrease below their contractual fixed rate 
the relationship between spreads on derivative instruments may vary from time to time  resulting in a net aggregate book value increase or decrease 
changes in the general level of interest rates can also affect our ability to acquire new investments and our ability to realize gains from the settlement of such assets 
sensitivity analysis the following discussion about the potential effects of changes in interest rates is based on a sensitivity analysis  which models the effects of hypothetical interest rate shifts on our financial condition and results of operations 
although we believe a sensitivity analysis provides the most meaningful analysis permitted by the rules and regulations of the sec  it is constrained by several factors  including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and by the inability to include the extraordinarily complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
although the following results of a sensitivity analysis for changes in interest rates may have some limited use as a benchmark  they should not be viewed as a forecast 
this forward looking disclosure also is selective in nature and addresses only the potential minimum contracted rental and interest expense impacts on our financial instruments and our six variable rate leases and  in particular  does not address the mark to market impact on our interest rate derivatives 
it also does not include a variety of other potential factors that could affect our business as a result of changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical basis point increase decrease in our variable interest rates would increase decrease the minimum contracted rentals on our portfolio as of december  by million and 
table of contents million  respectively  over the next twelve months 
as of december   a hypothetical basis point increase decrease in our variable interest rate on our borrowings would result in an interest expense increase decrease of million and million  respectively  net of amounts received from our interest rate derivatives  over the next twelve months
