item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a clinical stage drug development company that discovers and develops novel  small molecule drugs for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases  as well as for muscle disorders 
our pioneering research focuses on intracellular signaling pathways and related targets that are critical to disease mechanisms 
our productivity has resulted in strategic collaborations with large pharmaceutical partners to develop and market our product candidates 
current product development programs include fostamatinib  an oral syk inhibitor that has started its phase clinical trial program for ra partnered with az  and r  an inhaled syk inhibitor that is in clinical trials for asthma partnered with pfizer 
since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  contract payments under our collaboration agreements and equipment financing arrangements 
our research and development activities  including preclinical studies and clinical trials  consume substantial amounts of capital 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities 
we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to support our current and projected funding requirements through at least the next twelve months 
until we are able to generate sufficient amounts of product and royalty revenues  we expect to finance future cash needs through collaboration and licensing arrangements or public and or private equity or debt offerings  as well as through interest income earned on the investment of our cash balances and short term investments 
product development programs our product development portfolio features multiple novel  small molecule drug candidates whose specialized mechanisms of action are intended to provide therapeutic benefit for a range of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders  as well as for muscle disorders

research and development expenses our research and development expenditures include costs related to preclinical and clinical trials  scientific personnel  supplies  equipment  consultants  sponsored research  stock based compensation  and allocated facility costs 
we do not track fully burdened research and development costs separately for each of our drug candidates 
we review our research and development expense by focusing on three categories research  development  and other 
our research team is focused on creating a portfolio of product candidates that can be developed into small molecule therapeutics in our own proprietary programs or with potential collaborative partners and utilizes our robust discovery engine to rapidly discover and validate new product candidates in our focused range of therapeutic indications 
research expenses relate primarily to personnel expenses  lab supplies  fees to third party research consultants  and compounds 
our development group leads the implementation of our clinical and regulatory strategies and prioritizes disease indications in which our compounds may be studied in clinical trials 
development expenses relate primarily to clinical trials  personnel expenses  lab supplies  and fees to third party 
table of contents research consultants 
other expenses primarily include allocated stock based compensation expense relating to personnel in research and development groups and allocated facilities costs 
in addition to reviewing the three categories of research and development expense described in the preceding paragraph  we principally consider qualitative factors in making decisions regarding our research and development programs  which include enrollment in clinical trials and the results thereof  the clinical and commercial potential for our drug candidates and competitive dynamics 
we also make our research and development decisions in the context of our overall business strategy  which includes the evaluation of potential collaborations for the development of our drug candidates 
the following table presents our total research and development expense by category 
years ended december  in thousands categories research development other other expenses mainly represent allocated stock based compensation expenses of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and allocated facilities costs of approximately million for the year ended december  and million for each of the years ended december  and for the period from january  to december   total research and development expense by category was million  million  and million  for research  development  and other  respectively 
for the year ended december   the major portion of our research and development expense was related to the extension trials in ra patients and the oral jak inhibitor program 
for the years ended december  and  the major portion of our research and development expense was associated with our two phase b clinical trials taski and taski  as well as the related extension trials in ra patients 
the expenses for these programs are included under development in the table above 
the phase clinical trials of fostamatinib in ra were completed in we licensed the rights to fostamatinib to az in february on september   az announced the enrollment of the first patient in the phase clinical program for fostamatinib  referred to as oskira 
the first anticipated filings of new drug applications with the fda and the ema based on the oskira clinical trial program are planned for az will be responsible for conducting and funding all future development  regulatory filings  manufacturing and global commercialization of products containing oral syk inhibitors 
the scope and magnitude of future research and development expense are difficult to predict given the number of clinical trials that we will need to conduct for any of our potential products  as well as our limited capital resources 
preclinical testing and clinical development are long  expensive and uncertain processes 
in general  biopharmaceutical development involves a series of steps  beginning with identification of a potential target and including  among others  proof of concept in animals and phase  and clinical trials in humans 
each of these steps is typically more expensive than the previous step 
success in early stages of development often results in increasing expenditures for a given product candidate 
significant delays in clinical testing could materially impact our product development costs and timing of completion of the clinical trials 
we do not know whether planned 
table of contents clinical trials will begin on time  will need to be halted or revamped or will be completed on schedule  or at all 
clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons  including delays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial  delays from scale up  delays in reaching agreement on acceptable clinical trial agreement terms with prospective clinical sites  delays in obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective clinical site or delays in recruiting subjects to participate in a clinical study 
we currently do not have reliable estimates of total costs for a particular drug candidate to reach the market 
our potential products are subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process that may involve unanticipated additional clinical trials and may not result in receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals 
failure to receive the necessary regulatory approvals would prevent us from commercializing the product candidates affected 
in addition  clinical trials of our potential products may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy  which could prevent or significantly delay regulatory approval 
we do not have a reasonable basis to determine when or if material net cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of our drug candidates will occur 
commercialization of our product candidates depends upon successful completion of extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy for humans 
we do not know whether we  or any of our current or potential future collaborative partners  will undertake clinical trials of potential products beyond the trials already concluded and the trials currently in process 
it will take us  or our current or potential future collaborative partners  several years to complete any such testing  and failure can occur at any stage of testing 
interim results of trials do not necessarily predict final results  and acceptable results in early trials may not be repeated in later trials 
moreover  we or our current or potential future collaborative partners may decide to discontinue development of any project at any time for regulatory  commercial  scientific or other reasons 
to date  we have not commercialized any of our drug candidates  and we may never do so 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing and costs of completing the development of our drug candidates  see part i 
item a 
risk factors  including in particular the following risks if our corporate collaborations or license agreements are unsuccessful  our research and development efforts could be delayed 
if conflicts arise between our collaborators or advisors and us  any of them may act in their self interest  which may be adverse to our stockholders interests 
we might not be able to commercialize our product candidates successfully if problems arise in the clinical testing and approval process 
there is a high risk that drug discovery and development efforts might not successfully generate good product candidates 
our future funding requirements will depend on many uncertain factors 
because we expect to be dependent upon collaborative and license agreements  we might not meet our strategic objectives 
delays in clinical testing could result in increased costs to us 
for further discussion on research and development activities  see research and development expense under results of operations below 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting 
table of contents principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the terms of our research and development collaborations ie revenue recognition of upfront fees and certain milestone payments  investments  stock based compensation  impairment issues  the estimated useful life of assets  estimated accruals and contingencies  on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that there were no significant changes in our critical accounting policies during the year ended december  as compared to those previously disclosed in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition we present revenue from our collaboration arrangements under financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  collaboration arrangements 
our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are evaluated under fasb asc  multiple element arrangements  and are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of any undelivered items 
the consideration we receive is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 
non refundable  up front payments received in connection with research and development collaboration agreements  including technology access fees  are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the relevant periods of continuing involvement  generally the research term 
when a research term is not specified  we estimate the time it will take us to complete our deliverables under the contract and recognize the upfront fee using the straight line method over that time period 
we review our estimates every quarter for reasonableness 
revenues related to collaborative research with our corporate collaborators are recognized as research services are performed over the related development periods for each agreement 
under these agreements  we are required to perform research and development activities as specified in each respective agreement 
the payments received are not refundable and are generally based on a contractual cost per full time equivalent employee working on the project 
our research and development expenses under the collaborative research agreements approximate the revenue recognized under such agreements over the term of the respective agreements 
it is our policy to recognize revenue based on our level of effort expended  however  revenue recognized will not exceed amounts billable under the agreement 
revenues associated with substantive  at risk milestones pursuant to collaborative agreements are recognized upon achievement of the applicable milestones 

table of contents stock based compensation total stock based compensation expense related to our officers  directors and all other employees and consultants stock option plans that we recognized for the year ended december   and was comprised as follows years ended december  aggregate change aggregate change from from in thousands stock based compensation expense from officer  director and employee options consultant options restructuring charges total we grant options to purchase our common stock to our officers  directors and all other employees and consultants under our stock option plans 
eligible employees can also purchase shares of our common stock at a price per share equal to the lesser of of the fair market value on the first day of the offering period or of the fair market value on the purchase date under our employee stock purchase plan purchase plan 
the benefits provided under these plans are stock based payments subject to the provisions of fasb asc we adopted the use of the straight line attribution method over the requisite service period for the entire award 
in addition  we estimate the amount of expected forfeitures when calculating compensation costs  then record actual forfeitures as they occur 
we review our forfeiture rates each quarter and make any necessary changes to our estimates 
the increase in stock based compensation expense for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  was primarily due to the stock based compensation expense amortization resulting from the increase in the number of options granted in the second quarter of  as compared to the same period in  as well as an additional full quarter of stock based compensation expense amortization in the first quarter of related to options granted in late march of  which were fully amortized as of the end of the first quarter of the decrease in stock based compensation expense for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  was primarily due to the lower valuation of options granted in the first quarter of and only three quarters of the stock based compensation expense related to these grants being recognized in because of a late march grant date 
in february  we announced that we cut our research programs in virology and oncology as well as terminated certain related development and administrative staff  which resulted in the dismissal of employees  or approximately of our workforce 
this measure was intended to maintain our emphasis on our active preclinical and clinical programs  while conserving our resources 
as part of a package we offered the terminated employees  we extended the date the terminated employees had to exercise their vested options to december  rather than days from the termination date as is typically required under our equity incentive plan 
we recorded  of non cash stock based compensation expense incurred in connection with this modification in the first quarter of the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model is affected by our stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  volatility  expected term  risk free interest rate and dividends 
we estimate volatility over the expected term of the option using historical share price performance 
for expected term  among other things  we take into consideration our historical data of options exercised  cancelled and expired 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury constant maturity rate 
we have not paid and do not expect to pay 
table of contents dividends in the foreseeable future 
in order to calculate stock based compensation expense  we also estimate the forfeiture rate using our historical experience with options that cancel before they vest 
we also record charges associated with options granted to consultants reflecting the fair value and periodic fair value re measurement of outstanding consultant options under fasb asc the valuation is based upon the current market value of our common stock and other assumptions  including the expected future volatility of our stock price  risk free interest rate and expected term 
we amortize stock based compensation related to consultants using a straight line attribution method consistent with the method used for employees and with the attribution election we made upon adoption of fasb asc research and development accruals we have various contracts with third parties related to our research and development activities 
costs that are incurred but not billed to us as of the end of the period are accrued 
we make estimates of the amounts incurred in each period based on the information available to us and our knowledge of the nature of the contractual activities generating such costs 
clinical trial contract expenses are accrued based on units of activity reported by third parties 
expenses related to other research and development contracts  such as research contracts  toxicology study contracts and manufacturing contracts are estimated to be incurred generally on a straight line basis over the duration of the contracts 
raw materials and study materials purchased by third parties are expensed at the time of purchase 
many of our estimates are based significantly or in part on information provided by third parties 
if such information were not reported properly  our research and development expense amounts could be misstated

liquidity and capital resources cash requirements from inception  we have financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities  contract payments under our collaboration agreements and equipment financing arrangements 
we have consumed substantial amounts of capital to date as we continue our research and development activities  including preclinical studies and clinical trials 
in february  we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with az for the global development and commercialization of our oral syk inhibitors for the treatment of human diseases other than those primarily involving respiratory or 
table of contents pulmonary dysfunction 
az is responsible for conducting and funding all future development  regulatory filings  manufacturing and global commercialization of products containing oral syk inhibitors 
the agreement became effective on march  and  in connection with the effectiveness of the agreement  we received an upfront payment from az of million in april in october  we received million from az for the fulfillment of two major milestones under the worldwide license agreement for the initiation of the phase clinical trial program of fostamatinib in patients with ra and for the completion of the transfer of the fostamatinib long term open label extension study to az 
az is required to pay us up to an additional million if specified development  regulatory and launch milestones are achieved for fostamatinib 
we will also be eligible to receive up to an additional million if specified sales performance milestones are achieved for fostamatinib  as well as significant stepped double digit royalties on net sales worldwide 
in october  we were notified by the internal revenue service that we have been certified to receive a total cash grant of approximately million related to the previously filed applications under the qualifying therapeutic discovery projects section d of the internal revenue code 
of this amount  approximately million was received in november and the remainder is expected to be received in as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  as compared to approximately million as of december   an increase of approximately million 
the increase was primarily attributable to the receipt of the million in upfront and milestone payments from az  partially offset by operating expenses for the year ended december  we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to support our current and projected funding requirements through at least the next twelve months 
we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of our product candidates and other research and development activities  including risks and uncertainties that could impact the rate of progress of our development activities  we are unable to estimate with certainty the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials and other research and development activities 
our operations will require significant additional funding for the foreseeable future 
until we are able to generate sufficient amounts of product revenues and or royalty revenues  we expect to finance future cash needs through public and or private equity offerings  debt financings or collaboration and licensing arrangements  as well as through interest income earned on the investment of our cash balances and short term investments 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders could at that time experience substantial dilution 
any debt financing that we are able to obtain may involve operating covenants that restrict our business 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish some of our rights to our technologies or product candidates  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
our future funding requirements will depend upon many factors  including  but not limited to the progress and success of clinical trials and preclinical activities including studies and manufacture of materials of our product candidates conducted by our collaborative partners or licensees or us  our ability to meet the milestones identified in our collaborative agreements that trigger payments to us from our collaboration partners  the progress of research programs carried out by us  any changes in the breadth of our research and development programs  
table of contents the progress of the research and development efforts of our collaborative partners  our ability to acquire or license other technologies or compounds that we seek to pursue  our ability to manage our growth  competing technological and market developments  the costs and timing of obtaining  enforcing and defending our patent and intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals and filings by us and our collaborators  and expenses associated with the pending and potential additional related purported securities class action lawsuits  as well as any unforeseen litigation 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs  to lose rights under existing licenses or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose or may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
for the years ended december  and  we maintained an investment portfolio primarily in money market funds  us treasury bills  government sponsored enterprise securities  and corporate bonds and commercial paper 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested with regard to liquidity and capital preservation 
wherever possible  we seek to minimize the potential effects of concentration and degrees of risk 
cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities years ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million in compared to net cash used in operating activities of approximately million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in compared with was mainly due to the receipt from az of the million upfront payment in april and million in milestone payments in october  partially offset by the cash payments related to our research and development programs 
the decrease in net cash used in operating activities in compared with was primarily due to the decrease in cash payments related to our research and development programs 
the timing of cash requirements may vary from period to period depending on our research and development activities  including our planned preclinical and clinical trials  and future requirements to establish commercial capabilities for any products that we may develop 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million in compared to approximately million and million in and  respectively

net cash provided by financing activities in included proceeds from the exercise of outstanding options and the issuance of shares under our purchase plan of approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities in and was mainly due to the public offerings we completed in those years 
in the third quarter of  we completed a public offering in which we received net proceeds of approximately million 
in the first quarter of  we completed a public offering in which we received net proceeds of approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities also included proceeds from the exercise of outstanding options and the issuance of shares under our purchase plan of approximately million and million in and  respectively 
we did not have proceeds from capital lease financing in and compared to approximately million in net cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by payments on capital lease obligations of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k under the exchange act that create potential material risks for us and that are not recognized on our balance sheets 
contractual obligations as of december   we had the following contractual commitments payment due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands capital lease obligations facilities lease total as of december   we had approximately  in capital lease obligations including the interest portion associated with our equipment 
all existing capital lease agreements as of december  are secured by the equipment financed  bear interest at rates between and and are due in monthly installments through item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the market value amount of our investment will decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and available for sale securities in a variety of securities  including money market funds and government and non government debt securities 
in  
table of contents and  we maintained an investment portfolio primarily in money market funds  u 
s 
treasury bills  government sponsored enterprise securities  and corporate bonds and commercial paper 
due to the primarily short term nature of these investments  we believe we do not have a material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
in addition  we believe we have no incremental or new risk related to recent credit market volatility 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosure is provided 
we have operated primarily in the united states  and all funding activities with our collaborators to date have been made in us dollars 
accordingly  we have not had any significant exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
