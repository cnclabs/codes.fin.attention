introduction the pep boys manny  moe jack is the only national chain offering automotive service  tires  parts and accessories 
this positioning allows us to streamline the distribution channel and pass the savings on to our customers facilitating our vision to be the automotive solutions provider of choice for the value oriented customer 
the majority of our stores are in a supercenter format  which serves both do it for me difm  which includes service labor  installed merchandise and tires and do it yourself diy customers with the highest quality service offerings and merchandise 
most of our supercenters also have a commercial sales program that provides delivery of tires  parts and other products to automotive repair shops and dealers 
in  as part of our long term strategy to lead with automotive service  we began complementing our existing supercenter store base with service tire centers 
these service tire centers are designed to capture market share and leverage our existing supercenter and support infrastructure 
during fiscal  we opened new service tire centers and seven new supercenters 
we are targeting a total of new service tire centers and five supercenters in fiscal and service tire centers and supercenters in fiscal as of january   we operated supercenters and service tire centers  as well as legacy pep express retail only stores throughout states and puerto rico 
executive summary fiscal was our second consecutive profitable year marked by an increase in net earnings of million  or 
fiscal net earnings were million as compared to million in fiscal our diluted earnings per share for fiscal were as compared to in fiscal the increase in profitability was the result of positive comparable store sales across all lines of business and improved total gross profit margins partially offset by higher selling  general and administrative expenses and higher interest expense 
total revenue for fiscal increased compared to the prior year 
for fiscal  our comparable store sales sales generated by locations in operation during the same period of the prior year increased by compared to a decrease of for the prior year 
the increase in comparable store sales was comprised of a increase in comparable store service revenue and a increase in comparable store merchandise sales 
sales of services and non discretionary products are primarily impacted by miles driven  which had returned to pre recession low single digit growth rates from march through november  in part due to lower gasoline prices 
as gasoline prices in recent months have been trending higher  we 
table of contents expect to see a negative impact on miles driven 
however  we cannot predict future fluctuations in gasoline prices  nor the ultimate impact of such fluctuations on miles driven in future periods 
there are also various factors occurring within the current economy that affect both our consumer and our industry  including the impact of the recent recession  higher unemployment and a tighter credit environment  which we believe have aided our sales of non discretionary product and services as customers have focused on maintaining their existing vehicles rather than purchasing new vehicles 
despite the recent increase in new car sales which still remain significantly below historical levels  the median age of the us light vehicle fleet continues to trend in our industry favor 
given the nature of these macroeconomic factors  we cannot predict whether or for how long these trends will continue  nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future 
however  these same trends have negatively impacted sales in our discretionary product categories like accessories and complementary merchandise since fiscal  although the rate of decline has moderated significantly since then 
in  we continued our surround sound media campaign that utilizes television  radio and direct mail advertising to communicate our does everything 
for less 
brand vision and focused on execution excellence in our stores in order earn the trust of our customers every day 
we believe these efforts are responsible for increased customer traffic in our stores in all lines of business for fiscal results of operations the following discussion explains the material changes in our results of operations for the years ended january  and january  and january

fiscal total revenue and comparable store sales for fiscal increased and  respectively  over the prior year 
total revenue for fiscal increased by million to  million from  million in fiscal the increase in comparable store revenues consisted of a increase in comparable store service revenue and a increase in comparable store merchandise sales 
while our total revenue figures were favorably impacted by our opening of new stores in fiscal 
table of contents  a new store is not added to our comparable store sales base until it reaches its th month of operation 
non comparable store sales contributed an additional million of total revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal total comparable store sales increased due to growth in customer counts in all three lines of business combined with an increase in the total average transaction amount per customer 
total merchandise sales increased  or million  to  million in fiscal as compared to  million in fiscal comparable store merchandise sales increased  or million  as compared to the prior year  driven primarily by increased customer counts across all lines of business as well as an increase in the average transaction amount per customer 
the balance of the increase in merchandise sales was due to the contribution from our non comparable stores 
total service revenue increased  or million  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal comparable store service revenue increased  or million  as compared to the prior year  due to higher customer counts partially offset by a decrease in average transaction amount per customer 
the balance of the increase in service revenue was primarily due to the contribution from our non comparable store base which accounted for an additional million of service revenue 
in fiscal  comparable customer count increased versus fiscal in all lines of business due to our traffic driving promotional events and rewards program and our improved customer experience resulting from better store execution 
our core automotive parts and tires categories  which make up approximately of our merchandise sales  experienced a increase in comparable store sales 
we believe that utilizing innovative marketing programs to communicate our value priced  differentiated merchandise assortment will continue to drive increased customer counts and that our continued focus on delivering a better customer experience than our competitors will convert those increased customer counts into sales improvements consistently over all lines of business 
gross profit from merchandise sales increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross profit margin from merchandise sales increased to for fiscal from for fiscal gross profit from merchandise sales for fiscal included a net benefit of million comprised of a million reduction in our reserve for excess inventory see below and the reversal of an inventory related accrual of approximately million partially offset by an million asset impairment charge 
gross profit from merchandise sales for fiscal included a net benefit of million comprised of the reversal of inventory related accruals of approximately million and a million gain from an insurance settlement  largely offset by a million asset impairment charge 
excluding these items from both years  gross profit margin from merchandise sales improved by basis points to in fiscal from in the prior year 
this improvement was primarily due to less inventory shrinkage  lower defective product expense and increased merchandise sales  which better leveraged fixed store occupancy costs such as rent and utilities and warehousing costs such as payroll and out bound freight costs 
in fiscal we reduced our reserve for excess inventory by million  of which million was recorded in the fourth quarter  as a result of significant improvements in the quality of our inventory  including i improving inventory management  including timely return of excess product to vendors for full credit  ii maintaining relatively flat inventory levels despite the investment in new stores  iii reducing inventory lead times and safety stock requirements  including consolidating slow moving hard parts inventory into one centrally located warehouse  which led to significant reductions in slower moving parts inventory at our distribution centers  and iv increasing our inventory turnover ratio  which is reflected in our increased comparable store sales 
gross profit from service revenue decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in the prior year 
gross profit margin from service revenue decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal gross profit from service revenue for fiscal included a 
table of contents million asset impairment charge related to previously closed stores 
gross profit from service revenue for fiscal included a million asset impairment charge related to previously closed stores 
excluding these items from both years  gross profit margin from service revenue decreased to for fiscal from in the prior year 
the decrease in gross profit from service revenue was due to the opening of new service tire centers  which while in their ramp up stage for sales incur their full amount of fixed expenses  including payroll and occupancy costs rent  utilities and building maintenance 
our new service tire centers negatively impacted gross margins by basis points in fiscal excluding the impact of new service tire centers and the impairment charges described above  gross profit from service revenue increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in gross profit  exclusive of new locations  was primarily due to increased service revenues which better leveraged fixed store occupancy costs and  to a lesser extent  labor costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million 
the increase was primarily due to higher payroll and related expenses of million  higher media expense of million and increased travel costs of million 
the reduction as a percentage of sales reflects improved leverage of selling  general and administrative expenses achieved through increased sales in fiscal net gains from the disposition of assets increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal fiscal includes million in net settlement proceeds from the disposition of a previously closed property  while fiscal reflects an aggregate gain of million from three store sale and leaseback transactions 
interest expense for fiscal was million  an increase of million  compared to million in fiscal interest expense for fiscal included a million gain from the retirement of debt 
excluding this item  interest expense decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to reduced debt levels 
income tax expense for fiscal was million  or an effective rate of  as compared to million  or an effective rate of  for fiscal the fiscal effective tax rate includes a million benefit related to the reduction of a valuation allowance on certain state net operating losses and credits 
the fiscal effective tax rate includes a million benefit due to the allocation of additional costs to certain jurisdictions thereby reducing past and future tax liabilities 
as a result of the foregoing  we reported net earnings of million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  as compared to net earnings of million for fiscal our diluted earnings per share were for fiscal as compared to for fiscal fiscal vs 
fiscal total revenue and comparable sales for fiscal decreased and  respectively as compared to the prior year 
the decrease in comparable store revenues consisted of a increase in comparable service revenue offset by a decrease in comparable merchandise sales 
while our total revenue figures were favorably impacted by our opening of new stores in fiscal  a new store is not added to our comparable store sales base until it reaches its th month of operation 
total merchandise sales decreased to  million compared to  million in fiscal total service revenue increased to million from million in the prior year 
the decrease in merchandise sales was primarily due to weaker sales in our retail business stemming from less discretionary spending by our customers and lower diy customer counts 
excluding sales of discretionary products such as generators  electronics and transportation products  our diy core 
table of contents automotive sales remained relatively flat year over year 
service revenues increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to increased customer counts 
during fiscal  customer traffic generated by improved store execution  promotional events and an improved hard parts inventory position resulted in an increase in service and commercial customer count 
however  total customer count declined as a result of a decrease in diy customer count 
we believe the decrease in retail customer count is due to reduced spending as a result of the current economic environment and our competitors continuing to open new stores as well as the result of the long term industry decline in the diy business  as discussed in the business section of our form k 
in addition  we carry a large assortment of more discretionary retail product that is more susceptible to consumer spending deferrals 
we continue to believe that providing a differentiated merchandise assortment  better customer experience  low price value proposition and innovative marketing will stem the overall decline in customer counts and sales over the long term 
in fact  customer count in our diy space declined at a much lower rate in fiscal as compared to the prior year and we experienced our first increase in total customer count and sales in our third fiscal quarter since the first quarter of fiscal  and the fourth quarter of fiscal  respectively 
gross profit from merchandise sales increased by million to million for fiscal from million in the prior year 
gross profit from merchandise sales increased to for fiscal from for fiscal gross profit from merchandise sales in fiscal includes the reversal of inventory accruals of approximately million established in the prior year related to our temporarily restricting the sale of certain small engine merchandise that was subject to an ongoing epa inquiry and a gain from insurance settlements of million  mostly offset by an asset impairment charge of million as a result of continued declines in real estate values of previously closed locations 
in the prior year  gross profit from merchandise sales included an asset impairment charge of million and a million inventory accrual due to the epa inquiry referred to above 
excluding these adjustments from both years  gross profit from merchandise sales increased to for fiscal from in the prior year 
gross profit from merchandise sales increased despite a decrease in merchandise sales as discussed above  primarily as a result of an improvement in inventory shrinkage  lower in bound freight costs  lower warehousing costs which declined by basis points to of merchandise sales and lower store occupancy costs which declined by basis points to of merchandise sales 
warehousing costs declined primarily due to lower out bound freight costs to stores and occupancy costs declined due to lower building maintenance costs and the elimination of equipment leasing costs 
gross profit from service revenue increased to for fiscal from in fiscal gross profit from service revenue increased by million  or 
both the current year and the prior year gross profit from service revenue included an asset impairment charge related to previously closed stores of million and million  respectively 
excluding these adjustments from both years  gross profit from service revenues increased to for fiscal from in the prior year 
the increase in gross profit was primarily due to increased service revenue which resulted in higher absorption of fixed expenses such as occupancy costs and  to a certain extent  labor costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses  decreased to of total revenues in fiscal from in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million or 
the decrease was primarily due to lower media expense of million  lower legal expenses and professional services fees of million  reduced payroll and related expenses of million  lower travel expenses of million and improved general liability claims expense of million 
net gains from the disposition of assets for fiscal and fiscal reflect gains of million and million  respectively  primarily as a result of sale leaseback transactions 
the company completed sale leaseback transactions on four stores during fiscal  as compared to sale leaseback transactions on approximately stores in fiscal 
table of contents interest expense was million in fiscal  a decline of million compared to the prior year 
fiscal and included gains from the retirement of debt of million and million  respectively 
fiscal also included a million charge for deferred financing costs related to our revolving credit facility that was replaced 
excluding these items  interest expense declined by million from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to reduced debt levels 
income tax expense was million  or an effective rate of  for fiscal as compared to an income tax benefit of million  or an effective rate of  for fiscal the current year effective tax rate includes a benefit of million due to the allocation of additional costs to certain jurisdictions thereby reducing past and future tax liabilities 
the prior year effective tax rate was impacted by the non deductibility of certain expenses for tax purposes  the recognition of gain for tax on surrender of life insurance policies and the establishment of a valuation allowance on certain state net operating losses and credits 
loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  was million in fiscal versus million in fiscal fiscal and included  on a pre tax basis  impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
as a result of the foregoing  we reported net earnings of million for fiscal  an increase of million from our net loss of million in fiscal our basic and diluted earnings per share were for fiscal as compared to our basic and diluted loss per share of in the prior year 
discontinued operations the analysis of our results of continuing operations excludes the operating results of closed stores  where the customer base could not be maintained  which have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
industry comparison we operate in the us automotive aftermarket  which has two general lines of business the service business  defined as do it for me service labor  installed merchandise and tires and the retail business  defined as do it yourself retail merchandise and commercial 
generally  specialized automotive retailers focus on either the service or retail area of the business 
we believe that operation in both the service and retail areas positively differentiates us from most of our competitors 
although we manage our performance at a store level in aggregation  we believe that the following presentation  which includes the reclassification of revenue from merchandise that we install in customer vehicles to service center revenue  shows an accurate comparison against competitors within the two sales arenas 
we compete in the retail area of the business through our retail sales floor and 
table of contents commercial sales business 
our service center business competes in the service area of the industry 
the following table presents the revenues and gross profit for each area of the business

capital liquidity capital resources and needs our cash requirements arise principally from the purchase of inventory and capital expenditures related to existing and new stores  offices and distribution centers  debt service and contractual obligations 
cash flows realized through the sales of automotive services  tires  parts and accessories are our primary source of liquidity 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal the million improvement was due to increased net earnings net of non cash adjustments of million and a favorable change in operating assets and liabilities of million  offset by an increase in cash used in discontinued operations of million 
the change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a favorable change in merchandise inventories net of accounts payable of million 
taking into consideration changes in our trade payable program liability shown as cash flows from financing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows  inventory net of accounts payable improved by million primarily due to increased inventory purchases and an improvement in our vendor trade payable terms 
the ratio of accounts payable  including our trade payable program  to inventory was at january   and at january  the favorable change in all other long term assets and liabilities was due to increased accruals for payroll tax in the current year due to timing of payments to taxing authorities mostly offset by a discretionary contribution to our defined benefit pension plan of million see note to the consolidated financial statements in the current year 
cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal capital expenditures were million and million  for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
capital expenditures for fiscal  in addition to our regularly scheduled store and distribution center improvements  included the addition of seven new supercenters and new service tire centers and the upgrade of our store systems hardware

during fiscal  we acquired substantially all of the assets other than real property of florida tire  inc for million 
in connection with the acquisition  we recorded a contingent liability of million  of which million was paid in fiscal during fiscal  we used million as collateral for retained liabilities included within existing insurance programs in lieu of previously outstanding letters of credit 
this collateral is recorded within other long term assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of january  our targeted capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be approximately million 
our fiscal capital expenditures include the addition of approximately service tire centers  five supercenters and the conversion of supercenters into superhubs 
these expenditures are expected to be funded by cash on hand and net cash generated from operating activities 
additional capacity  if needed  exists under our existing line of credit 
in fiscal  cash provided by financing activities was million  as compared to cash used in financing activities of million in the prior year 
the million improvement was primarily due to increased net borrowings under our trade payable program of million combined with the net repayment  in fiscal  of million of borrowings under our credit facility 
the trade payable program is funded by various bank participants who have the ability  but not the obligation  to purchase  directly from our vendors  account receivables owed by pep boys 
in fiscal  we increased the availability under this financing program to million from million in fiscal as of january  and january   we had an outstanding balance classified as trade payable program liability on the consolidated balance sheet of million and million  respectively 
additionally  in fiscal  we repurchased million of our outstanding senior subordinated notes for million 
in fiscal we repurchased million of the senior subordinated notes for million 
we anticipate that cash on hand and cash generated by operating activities will exceed our expected cash requirements in fiscal year in addition  we expect to have excess availability under our existing revolving credit agreement during the entirety of fiscal year as of january   we had no borrowings on our revolving credit facility and undrawn availability of million

see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of our pension plans 
the above table does not reflect the timing of projected settlements for our recorded asset retirement obligation costs of million  income tax liabilities of million and pension obligation of million because we cannot make a reliable estimate of the timing of the related cash payments 
commercial commitments total within year from to years from to years after years dollar amounts in thousands commercial letters of credit standby letters of credit surety bonds purchase obligations total commercial commitments our open purchase orders are based on current inventory or operational needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short periods of time 
we currently do not have minimum purchase commitments under our vendor supply agreements and generally  our open purchase orders orders that have not been shipped are not binding agreements 
those purchase obligations that are in transit from our vendors at january  that we do not have legal title to are considered commercial commitments 
in fiscal  we entered into a commercial commitment to purchase million gallons of oil products at various prices over a one year period 
at january   we expect to meet the cumulative minimum purchase requirements under this contract and to completely satisfy and terminate this contract during fiscal long term debt senior subordinated notes  due december on december   we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes the notes due december  during fiscal and  the company repurchased notes in the principal amount of million and million  respectively

table of contents senior secured term loan facility  due october our senior secured term loan the term loan is due october  this facility is secured by a collateral pool consisting of real property and improvements associated with our stores  which is adjusted periodically based upon real estate values and borrowing levels 
interest accrues at the london interbank offered rate libor plus on this facility 
as of january   stores collateralized the senior secured term loan 
the outstanding balance under the term loan at the end of fiscal was million 
the million decline in the outstanding balance was due to quarterly principal payments of million 
revolving credit agreement  through january on january   we entered into a revolving credit agreement the agreement with available borrowings up to million 
our ability to borrow under the revolving credit agreement is based on a specific borrowing base consisting of inventory and accounts receivable 
total incurred fees of million were capitalized and are being amortized over the five year life of the facility 
the interest rate on this credit line is libor or prime plus to based upon the then current availability under the agreement 
fees based on the unused portion of the agreement range from to basis points 
as of january   there were no outstanding borrowings under the agreement 
the weighted average interest rate on all debt borrowings during fiscal and was and  respectively 
other matters several of our debt agreements require compliance with covenants 
the most restrictive of these requirements is contained in our revolving credit agreement 
during any period when the availability under the revolving credit agreement drops below the greater of million or of the borrowing base  we are required to maintain a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of at least  calculated as the ratio of a ebitda net income plus interest charges  provision for taxes  depreciation and amortization expense  non cash stock compensation expenses and other non recurring  non cash items minus capital expenditures and income taxes paid to b the sum of debt service charges and restricted payments made 
the failure to satisfy this covenant would constitute an event of default under the revolving credit agreement  which would result in a cross default under our senior subordinated notes and senior secured term loan 
as of january   the company had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit agreement  additional availability of approximately million and was in compliance with its financial covenants 
other contractual obligations we have a vendor financing program which is funded by various bank participants who have the ability  but not the obligation  to purchase account receivables owed by us directly from our vendors

the surety bonds guarantee certain of our payments for example utilities  easement repairs  licensing requirements and customs fees 
off balance sheet arrangements we lease certain property and equipment under operating leases and lease financings which contain renewal and escalation clauses  step rent provisions  capital improvements funding and other lease concessions 
these provisions are considered in the calculation of our minimum lease payments which are recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the applicable lease term 
any lease payments that are based upon an existing index or rate are included in our minimum lease payment calculations 
total operating lease commitments as of january  were million 
pension and retirement plans the company has a supplemental executive retirement plan serp 
this unfunded plan had a defined benefit component that provided key employees designated by the board of directors with retirement and death benefits 
retirement benefits were based on salary and bonuses  death benefits were based on salary 
benefits paid to a participant under the defined pension plan are deducted from the benefits otherwise payable under the defined benefit portion of the serp 
on january   we amended and restated our serp 
this amendment converted the defined benefit portion of the serp to a defined contribution portion for certain unvested participants and all future participants 
on december   the company terminated the defined benefit portion of the serp with a million payment and recorded a charge of million 
the serp currently consists of only the defined contribution plan which we refer to as our account plan 
the company has a qualified k savings plan and a separate savings plan for employees residing in puerto rico  which cover all full time employees who are at least years of age with one or more years of service 
the company contributes the lesser of of the first of a participant contributions or of the participant compensation 
for fiscal and  the company contributions were conditional upon the achievement of certain pre established financial performance goals which were met 
the company savings plans contribution expense was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we also have a defined benefit pension plan covering our full time employees hired on or before february  as of december   the company froze the accrued benefits under the plan and active participants became fully vested

pension plan assets are stated at fair market value and are composed primarily of money market funds and collective trust funds primarily invested in equity and fixed income investments 
the expense under these plans for fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the fiscal pension expense includes a serp settlement charge of million 
pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected return on plan assets of and a discount rate of 
in developing the expected return on asset assumptions  we evaluated input from our actuaries  including their review of asset class return expectations 
the discount rate utilized for the pension plans is based on a model bond portfolio with durations that match the expected payment patterns of the plans 
we continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions and make adjustments as necessary for the existing plans 
while we had no minimum funding requirement during fiscal  we made a million discretionary contribution to the defined benefit pension plan in october in fiscal  we contributed an aggregate of million to our pension plans to fund the retirement obligations and for the termination of the 
table of contents defined benefit portion of the serp 
based upon the current status of the plans  we do not expect to make any cash contributions in fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of our pension plans 
critical accounting policies and estimates management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to customer incentives  product returns and warranty obligations  bad debts  inventories  income taxes  financing operations  restructuring costs  retirement benefits  share based compensation  risk participation agreements  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following represent our more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements inventory is stated at lower of cost  as determined under the last in  first out lifo method  or market 
our inventory  consisting primarily of auto parts and accessories  is used on vehicles typically having longer lives 
because of this  along with our historical experience of returning most excess inventory to our vendors for full credit  the risk of obsolescence is minimal 
we establish a reserve for excess inventory for instances where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded costs 
the reserve is based on management judgment  including estimates and assumptions regarding marketability of products  the market value of inventory to be sold in future periods and on historical experiences where we received less than full credit from vendors for product returns 
in fiscal  we reduced our reserve for excess inventory by million to million from million primarily due to improvement in inventory management practices  including timely return of product to vendors for full credit 
however  in future periods we may be exposed to material losses should our vendors alter their policy with regard to accepting excess inventory returns 
a difference in our inventory reserves as of january  would have affected net income by approximately million in fiscal we record reserves for future sales returns  customer incentives  warranty claims and inventory shrinkage 
the reserves are based on expected returns of products and historical claims and inventory shrinkage experience 
if actual experience differs from historical levels  revisions in our estimates may be required 
a change in these reserves at january  would have affected net earnings by approximately million for fiscal we have risk participation arrangements with respect to workers compensation  general liability  automobile liability  other casualty coverages and health care insurance  including stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total exposure 
a reserve for the liabilities associated with these agreements is established using generally accepted actuarial methods 
table of contents followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience 
the amounts included in our costs related to these arrangements are estimated and can vary based on changes in assumptions  claims experience or the providers included in the associated insurance programs 
a change in our self insurance liabilities at january  would have affected net earnings by approximately million for fiscal we have significant pension costs and liabilities that are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  expected return on plan assets and mortality rates 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in selecting these assumptions 
changes in the related pension costs or liabilities may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions 
the following table highlights the sensitivity of our pension obligation and expense to changes in these assumptions  assuming all other assumptions remain constant change in assumption dollars in thousands impact on annual pension expense impact on projected benefit obligation percentage point decrease in discount rate increase increase  percentage point increase in discount rate decrease decrease  percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets increase percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets decrease we periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment 
management judgments  including judgments related to store cash flows  are based on market and operating conditions at the time of evaluation 
future events could cause management conclusion on impairment to change  requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value 
we have a share based compensation plan  which includes stock options and restricted stock units  or rsus 
we account for our share based compensation plans on a fair value basis 
we determine the fair value of our stock options at the date of the grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the rsus are awarded at a price equal to the market price of our underlying stock on the date of the grant 
in situations where we have granted stock options and rsus with market conditions  we have used monte carlo simulations in estimating the fair value of the award 
the pricing model and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include the expected life of stock options  expected stock price volatility  future employee stock option exercise behaviors and the estimate of award forfeitures 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are different from these assumptions  the share based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the share based compensation 
in addition  significant changes in these assumptions could materially impact our share based compensation expense on future awards 
a change in our share based compensation expense for fiscal would have affected net earnings by approximately million 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories  for tax and accounting purposes 
we determine our provision for income taxes based on federal and state tax laws and regulations currently in 
table of contents effect 
legislation changes currently proposed by certain states in which we operate  if enacted  could increase our transactions or activities subject to tax 
any such legislation that becomes law could result in an increase in our state income tax expense and our state income taxes paid  which could have a material effect on our net earnings 
at any one time our tax returns for many tax years are subject to examination by us federal  commonwealth  and state taxing jurisdictions 
for income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized in the financial statements unless it is more likely than not to be sustained 
we adjust these tax liabilities  as well as the related interest and penalties  based on the latest facts and circumstances  including recently published rulings  court cases  and outcomes of tax audits 
to the extent our actual tax liability differs from our established tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits  our effective tax rate may be materially impacted 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome of  the timing of  or the tax treatment of any particular tax position or deduction  we believe that our tax balances reflect the more likely than not outcome of known tax contingencies 
the temporary differences between the book and tax treatment of income and expenses result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a future period  income tax expense will be impacted 
actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods from either operations or projected tax planning strategies 
we had net deferred tax assets of million at january  recent accounting standards in march  the fasb issued guidance on accounting for split dollar life insurance arrangements which was included in asc compensation stock compensation

table of contents asu also clarifies existing disclosures for the level of disaggregating  disclosures about valuation techniques and inputs used to determine level or fair value measurements and includes conforming amendments to the guidance on employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets 
asu was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances or settlements in the roll forward activity for level fair value measurements which are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on the company consolidated financial statements
