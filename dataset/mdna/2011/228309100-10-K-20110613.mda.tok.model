item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is a summary of certain factors that management considers important in reviewing the company s results of operations  liquidity  capital resources and operating results 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
results of operations the following table contains results of operations for fiscal years and and the dollar and percentage changes for those periods in thousands  except percentages 
change change net sales by category bedding  blankets and accessories bibs  bath and disposable products total net sales cost of products sold gross profit of net sales marketing and administrative expenses of net sales interest expense other income expense income tax expense income from continuing operations discontinued operations net of taxes net income of net sales 
table of contents net sales sales of bedding  blankets and accessories were virtually the same for fiscal years and as the increases from new bedding and blanket programs were matched by decreases from discontinued programs and lower replenishment orders 
sales of bib  bath and disposable products increased in fiscal year as compared to the prior year primarily as a result of an increase of million in the aggregate due to the company s acquisition of substantially all of the assets of neat solutions  inc on july  the neat solutions acquisition and the company s acquisition of the bibsters product line of disposable infant bibs from the procter gamble company on may  the bibsters acquisition 
gross profit gross profit decreased in amount and as a percentage of net sales in fiscal year from fiscal year the decreases were due to higher raw material costs  primarily cotton  as well as an increase in labor  transportation and currency costs associated with the company s sourcing activities in china 
the company also sustained higher royalty shortfalls in fiscal from several of its licensors and had higher levels of promotional sales  which were at contribution margins that were lower than in fiscal year offsetting these cost increases were decreased amortization costs of  associated with the company s acquisition of the baby products line of springs global us  inc on november  marketing and administrative expenses marketing and administrative expenses for fiscal year increased in amount and as a percentage of net sales as compared to fiscal year the company incurred increased advertising costs of  in the current year as compared to the prior year 
the company also incurred certain costs in the current year which were not incurred in the prior year  primarily  in professional fees associated with certain corporate governance matters and  of costs in connection with the proxy contest related to the annual meeting of stockholders 
interest expense the decrease in interest expense for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is due to lower average balances on the company s revolving line of credit and term loan 
income tax expense the company s provision for income taxes on continuing operations is based on effective tax rates that were virtually unchanged at for fiscal year as compared to for fiscal year the company has endeavored to increase its prices to offset inflationary increases in its raw materials and other costs  but there is no assurance that the company will be successful in maintaining such price increases or in effecting such price increases in a manner that will provide a timely match to the cost increases 
known trends and uncertainties the company s financial results are closely tied to sales to the company s top three customers  which represented approximately of the company s gross sales in fiscal year a significant downturn experienced by any or all of these customers could lead to pressure on the company s revenues 
the company has also faced higher raw material costs  primarily cotton  as well as increases in labor  transportation and currency costs associated with the company s sourcing activities in china 
continued increases in these costs will adversely affect the profitability of the company if it cannot pass the cost increases along to its customers in the form of price increases or if the timing of price increases do not closely match the cost increases 
for a further discussion of trends  uncertainties and other factors that could impact the company s operating results  see risk factors in item a 

table of contents financial position  liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended april   compared to million for the year ended march  the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in inventory and accounts receivable balances 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal year compared million in the prior year 
cash used in investing activities was primarily associated with the bibsters acquisition in fiscal year and the neat solutions acquisition in fiscal year net cash used in financing activities was  in the current year compared to million in the prior year 
there were net borrowings of million in the current year on the company s revolving line of credit compared to million in net repayments in the prior year  the largest portion of which came from a reduction of the company s cash reserves in december the company had built up its cash reserves in the prior year by drawing on its revolving line of credit in order to preserve its ability to meet its working capital needs in the event that its primary lender should suffer an adverse liquidity event that would jeopardize the company s ability to access its revolving line of credit 
the company also paid  in dividends in the current year as compared to none in the prior year and had  in higher repayments of the company s term debt obligations in the current year 
total debt outstanding under the company s credit facilities before the reduction for the original issue discount on the company s non interest bearing notes increased from million at march  to million at april  the increase is due primarily to a million cash outlay to fund the bibsters acquisition and  in dividend payments  which was offset by net repayments from the company s operating cash flow 
the company s ability to make scheduled payments of principal  to pay the interest on its maturing indebtedness  to fund capital expenditures or to comply with its debt covenants will depend upon future performance 
the company s future performance is  to a certain extent  subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors beyond its control 
based upon the current level of operations  the company believes that its cash flow from operations and availability on its revolving line of credit will be adequate to meet its liquidity needs 
at april  and march   the company s long term debt consisted of the following in thousands april  march  revolving line of credit non interest bearing notes original issue discount less current maturities the company s credit facilities at april  consisted of the following revolving line of credit under a financing agreement with the cit group commercial services  inc cit  a subsidiary of cit group inc  of up to million  including a million sub limit for letters of credit  with an interest rate of prime plus at april  for base rate borrowings or libor plus at april   maturing on july  and secured by a first lien on all assets of the company 
as of april   the company had elected to pay interest on the revolving line of credit under the libor option 
also under the financing agreement  a monthly fee is assessed based on of the average unused portion of the million revolving line of credit  less any outstanding letters of credit 
this unused line fee amounted to  and  during fiscal years and  respectively 
at april   there was a balance due on the revolving line of credit of million  there was a  letter of credit outstanding and the company had million available under the revolving line of credit based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances 

table of contents the financing agreement contains usual and customary covenants for agreements of that type  including limitations on other indebtedness  liens  transfers of assets  investments and acquisitions  merger or consolidation transactions  dividends  transactions with affiliates and changes in or amendments to the organizational documents for the company and its subsidiaries 
subordinated notes totaling million which do not bear interest and are due on july  the original issue discount of  on this non interest bearing obligation at a market interest rate of is being amortized over the life of the notes 
minimum annual maturities of the company s credit facilities as of april  are as follows in thousands fiscal year revolver sub notes total total to reduce its exposure to credit losses and to enhance the predictability of its cash flow  the company assigns the majority of its trade accounts receivable to cit pursuant to factoring agreements 
under the terms of the factoring agreements  which expire on july   cit remits payments to the company on the average due date of each group of invoices assigned 
if a customer fails to pay cit by the due date  the company is charged interest at prime plus  which was at april   until payment is received 
the company incurred interest expense of  and  in fiscal years and  respectively  as a result of the failure of the company s customers to pay cit by the due date 
cit bears credit losses with respect to assigned accounts receivable from approved shipments  while the company bears the responsibility for adjustments from customers related to returns  allowances  claims and discounts 
cit may at any time terminate or limit its approval of shipments to a particular customer 
if such a termination or limitation were to occur  the company would either assume the credit risks for shipments to the customer after the date of such termination or limitation or cease shipments to such customer 
the company incurred factoring fees under the agreements of  and  during fiscal years and  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap as promulgated by the financial accounting standards board fasb  as well as the securities act  the exchange act and the rules and regulations thereunder as administered by the sec 
references herein to gaap are to topics within the fasb accounting standards codification the fasb asc  which the fasb periodically revises through the issuance of an accounting standards update asu and which has been established by the fasb as the authoritative source for gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated balance sheets and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the listing below  while not inclusive of all of the company accounting policies  sets forth those accounting policies which the company management believes embody the most significant judgments due to the uncertainties affecting their application and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 

table of contents revenue recognition sales are recorded when goods are shipped to customers and are reported net of allowances for estimated returns and allowances in the consolidated statements of income 
allowances for returns are estimated based on historical rates 
allowances for returns  advertising allowances  warehouse allowances and volume rebates are recorded commensurate with sales activity and the cost of such allowances is netted against sales in reporting the results of operations 
shipping and handling costs  net of amounts reimbursed by customers  are not material and are included in net sales 
allowances against accounts receivable the company s allowances against accounts receivable are primarily contractually agreed upon deductions for items such as advertising and warehouse allowances and volume rebates 
these deductions are recorded throughout the year commensurate with sales activity 
funding of the majority of the company s allowances occurs on a per invoice basis 
the allowances for customer deductions  which are netted against accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets  consist of agreed upon advertising support  markdowns and warehouse and other allowances 
all such allowances are recorded as direct offsets to sales and such costs are accrued commensurate with sales activities 
when a customer requests deductions  the allowances are reduced to reflect such payments or credits issued against the customer s account balance 
the company analyzes the components of the allowances for customer deductions monthly and adjusts the allowances to the appropriate levels 
the timing of the customer initiated funding requests for advertising support can cause the net balance in the allowance account to fluctuate from period to period 
the timing of such funding requests should have a minimal impact on the consolidated statements of income since such costs are accrued commensurate with sales activity 
to reduce its exposure to credit losses and to enhance the predictability of its cash flow  the company assigns the majority of its receivables under factoring agreements with cit 
in the event a factored receivable becomes uncollectible due to creditworthiness  cit bears the risk of loss 
the company s management must make estimates of the uncollectiblity of its non factored accounts receivable when evaluating the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts  which it accomplishes by specifically analyzing accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in its customers payment terms 
the company s accounts receivable at april  amounted to million  net of allowances of million 
of this amount  million was due from cit under the factoring agreements  which represents the maximum amount of loss that the company could incur if cit failed completely to perform its obligations thereunder 

table of contents royalty payments the company has entered into agreements that provide for royalty payments based on a percentage of sales with certain minimum guaranteed amounts 
these royalty amounts are accrued based upon historical sales rates adjusted for current sales trends by customers 
royalty expense is included in cost of sales and amounted to million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
inventory valuation the preparation of the company financial statements requires careful determination of the appropriate dollar amount of the company inventory balances 
such amount is presented as a current asset in the company consolidated balance sheets and is a direct determinant of cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income and  therefore  has a significant impact on the amount of net income reported in the accounting periods 
the basis of accounting for inventories is cost  which is the sum of expenditures and charges  both direct and indirect  incurred to acquire inventory  bring it to a condition suitable for sale  and store it until it is sold 
once cost has been determined  the company s inventory is then stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the first in  first out fifo method  which assumes that inventory quantities are sold in the order in which they are acquired 
the determination of the indirect charges and their allocation to the company finished goods inventories is complex and requires significant management judgment and estimates 
if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates  then differences would result in the valuation of the company inventories and in the amount and timing of the company cost of goods sold and resulting net income for the reporting period 
on a periodic basis  management reviews its inventory quantities on hand for obsolescence  physical deterioration  changes in price levels and the existence of quantities on hand which may not reasonably be expected to be sold within the company s normal operating cycle 
to the extent that any of these conditions is believed to exist or the market value of the inventory expected to be realized in the ordinary course of business is otherwise no longer as great as its carrying value  an allowance against the inventory value is established 
to the extent that this allowance is established or increased during an accounting period  an expense is recorded in cost of goods sold in the company consolidated statements of income 
only when inventory for which an allowance has been established is later sold or is otherwise disposed is the allowance reduced accordingly 
significant management judgment is required in determining the amount and adequacy of this allowance 
in the event that actual results differ from management estimates or these estimates and judgments are revised in future periods  the company may not fully realize the carrying value of its inventory or may need to establish additional allowances  either of which could materially impact the company financial position and results of operations 
depreciation and amortization the company s consolidated balance sheets reflect property  plant and equipment  and certain intangible assets at cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization 
the company capitalizes additions and improvements and expenses maintenance and repairs as incurred 
depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which are three to eight years for property  plant and equipment  and one to sixteen years for intangible assets other than goodwill 
the company amortizes improvements to its leased facilities over the term of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset  whichever is shorter 
valuation of long lived assets  identifiable intangible assets and goodwill in addition to the depreciation and amortization procedures set forth above  the company reviews for impairment long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any asset may not be recoverable 
in the event of impairment  the asset is written down to its fair market value 
assets to be disposed of  if any  are recorded at the lower of net book value or fair market value  less estimated costs to sell at the date management commits to a plan of disposal  and are classified as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company tests the carrying value of its goodwill annually on the first day of the company s fiscal year 
an additional impairment test is performed during the year whenever an event or change in circumstances suggest that the fair value of the goodwill of either of the reporting units of the company has more likely than not fallen below its carrying value 
provision for income taxes the company s provision for income taxes includes all currently payable federal  state  local and foreign taxes that are based on the company taxable income and the change during the fiscal year in net deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
the company provides for deferred income taxes based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the company s policy is to recognize the effect that a change in enacted tax rates would have on net deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period that the tax rates are changed 
the company provision for income taxes on continuing operations is based on effective tax rates of and in fiscal years and  respectively 
these effective tax rates are the sum of the top us statutory federal income tax rate and a composite rate for state income taxes net of federal tax benefit in the various states in which the company operates 

table of contents management evaluates items of income  deductions and credits reported on the company s various federal and state income tax returns filed and recognizes the effect of positions taken on those income tax returns only if those positions are more likely than not to be sustained 
recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized 
changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs 
based on its recent evaluation  the company has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the company s consolidated financial statements 
tax years still open to federal or state general examination or other adjustment as of april  were the tax years ended march   march   march  and april   as well as the tax year ended april  for several states 
the company s policy is to accrue interest expense and penalties as appropriate on any estimated unrecognized tax benefits as a charge to interest expense in the company s consolidated statements of income 
recently issued accounting standards on may   the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
this asu is intended to improve consistency across jurisdictions to ensure that us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrss fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are described in the same way 
for public entities  the amendments in this asu are to be applied prospectively effective for annual periods beginning after december   and early application is not permitted 
the company does not anticipate that its adoption of asu no 
on april  will impact its consolidated financial statements
