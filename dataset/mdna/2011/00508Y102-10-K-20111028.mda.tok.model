outlook the performance of the company  like most companies  is influenced by a multitude of factors  including the vitality of the economy  employment  credit availability and cost  consumer confidence  commodity costs  and government policy  particularly as it impacts capital formation and risk taking by businesses and commercial developers 
the company experienced many challenges in fiscal due primarily to continued weakness in non residential construction and higher input costs  and management anticipates continued challenges for fiscal due primarily to on going volatility in both customer demand and commodity costs 
pricing and availability for certain materials and components  including steel  petroleum based inputs  and certain rare earth metals  continue to be volatile  placing pressure on the company margins 
while the company previously announced price increases to recover these higher input costs  the benefit of the price increase  which became effective at the end of the 
table of contents second quarter of fiscal  did not fully offset the incremental costs associated with higher commodity prices during the fiscal year 
additionally  the recently initiated price increases during the first quarter of fiscal are not expected to be fully realized until the second quarter of fiscal due to the typical lag in realizing the benefits 
due to the competitive forces in the current market environment  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to pass along all cost increases or adjust prices quickly enough to offset all or a portion of potentially higher material and component prices 
key indicators suggest that the north american non residential construction market  a key market for the company  is expected to decline modestly during fiscal however  third party forecasts suggest that the lighting market in north america will increase in the low single digits in fiscal compared with fiscal  due primarily to increased renovation activity 
in addition to the acquisitions completed over the last three years  which significantly increased the company lighting solutions portfolio and further positioned the company for future growth  management believes the execution of the company strategy will provide growth opportunities  which should enable the company to continue to outperform the overall markets it serves 
this strategy includes the continued spending for activities to develop energy efficient lighting solutions particularly around the company led based lighting portfolio  incorporate new technologies  enhance service to its customers  and expand market presence in key geographies and sectors  such as the renovation market 
the company believes it is well positioned to take advantage of opportunities within the na addressable lighting market  as comprehensive lighting solutions will likely become an integral part of the development of smart grid smart building energy management systems 
additionally  management believes these actions and investments will position the company to meet or exceed its financial goals over the longer term 
management remains positive about the future prospects of the company and its ability to outperform the markets it serves 
management believes the na addressable lighting market will experience solid growth over the next decade  particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront  and that the company is well positioned to fully participate in these growth opportunities 
accounting standards adopted in fiscal in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu 
asu addresses the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit 
specifically  this guidance amends the criteria in subtopic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
a selling price hierarchy is established for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which is based on a vendor specific objective evidence  b third party evidence  or c estimates 
this guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
additional disclosures related to a vendor multiple deliverable revenue arrangements are also required by this update 
asu is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into  or materially modified  in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
therefore  asu became effective on a prospective basis for the company on september  the adoption of asu had an immaterial impact on the company results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows

asu changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements to allow for alternatives when vendor specific objective evidence does not exist 
under this guidance  tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible product essential functionality and hardware components of a tangible product containing software components are excluded from the software revenue guidance in subtopic  software revenue recognition  thus  these arrangements are excluded from this update 
asu is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
therefore  asu became effective on a prospective basis for the company on september  the adoption of asu had an immaterial impact on the company results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
accounting standards yet to be adopted in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 business combinations topic disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations asu 
this standard update clarifies that  when presenting comparative financial statements  sec registrants should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the current period business combinations had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the update also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount 
table of contents of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
asu is effective prospectively for material either on an individual or aggregate basis business combinations entered into in fiscal years beginning on or after december   with early adoption permitted 
asu is therefore effective for the company for acquisitions made after the beginning of fiscal the company does not expect asu to have a material effect on the company results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows  however  the company may have additional disclosure requirements if a material acquisition occurs 
in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss asu  which clarifies the wording and disclosures required in accounting standards codification asc topic  fair value measurement asc  to converge with those used to be used in international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the update explains how to measure and disclose fair value under asc however  the fasb does not expect the changes in this standards update to alter the current application of the requirements in asc the provisions of asu are effective for public entities prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after december  early adoption is prohibited 
therefore  asu is effective for the company during the third quarter of fiscal the company does not expect asu to have a material effect on the company results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income asu 
asu changes the presentation of comprehensive income in the financial statements for all periods reported and eliminates the option under the current guidance that allows for presentation of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders equity 
the update proposes two options for the proper presentation of comprehensive income a single statement of comprehensive income  which includes all components of net income and other comprehensive income  or a statement of income followed immediately by a statement of comprehensive income  which includes the summarized net income and all components of other comprehensive income 
the provisions of asu are effective for public entities retrospectively for annual periods  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
therefore  asu is effective for the company in the first quarter of fiscal although the provisions of this update will change the presentation of the consolidated financial statements of the company  no material impact is expected on the company results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment asu  which allows companies to assess qualitative factors prior to the use of the two step quantitative method to determine if goodwill has been impaired 
if the qualitative factors reviewed do not indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit does not exceed the carrying value  asu deems any further impairment testing to be unnecessary 
in the event that the qualitative review indicates otherwise  the company is required to perform further quantitative impairment testing as prescribed by topic other indefinite lived intangible assets are not affected by the provisions of this standards update 
asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
the company is currently reviewing the provisions of asu but does not expect it to have a material effect on the company results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses the financial condition and results of operations as reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
as discussed in the description of business and basis of presentation footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to inventory valuation  depreciation  amortization and the recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill and intangible assets  share based compensation expense  medical  product warranty  and other reserves  litigation  and environmental matters 
management bases its estimates and judgments on its substantial historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management discusses the development of accounting estimates with the company s audit committee 
see the summary of significant accounting policies footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of the accounting policies of acuity brands 
the management of acuity brands believes the following represent the company s critical accounting estimates 
table of contents inventories inventories include materials  direct labor  in bound freight  and related manufacturing overhead  and are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out or average cost basis or market 
management reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess or obsolete inventory primarily based on estimated future demand and current market conditions 
a significant change in customer demand or market conditions could render certain inventory obsolete and thus could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results in the period the change occurs 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets the company reviews goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis in the fiscal fourth quarter or on an interim basis  if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not indicate that the fair value of the long lived asset is below its carrying value 
all other long lived and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles would be recognized based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its estimated fair value  which would be determined based on either discounted future cash flows or other appropriate fair value methods 
the evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for impairment requires management to use significant judgments and estimates in accordance with us gaap including  but not limited to  projected future net sales  operating results  and cash flows 
although management currently believes that the estimates used in the evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are reasonable  differences between actual and expected net sales  operating results  and cash flows and or changes in the discount rate or theoretical royalty rate could cause these assets to be deemed impaired 
if this were to occur  the company would be required to record a non cash charge to earnings for the write down in value of such assets  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial position  but not its cash flows from operations 
goodwill the company is comprised of one reporting unit with a goodwill balance of in determining the fair value of the company s reporting unit  the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis  which requires significant assumptions about discount rates as well as short and long term growth or decline rates  in accordance with us gaap 
the company utilized an estimated discount rate of approximately as of june   based on the capital asset pricing model  which considers the updated risk free interest rate  beta  market risk premium  and entity specific size premium 
short term growth or decline rates are based on management s forecasted financial results  which consider key business drivers such as specific revenue growth initiatives  market share changes  growth or decline in non residential and residential construction markets  and general economic factors such as credit availability and interest rates 
the company calculates the discounted cash flows using a year discrete period with a terminal value and compares this calculation to the discounted cash flows generated over a year period to ensure reasonableness 
the long term growth rate used in determining terminal value is estimated at slightly less than for the company and is primarily based on the company s understanding of projections for expected long term growth in non residential construction  the company s key market  and historical long term performance 
during fiscal  the company performed an evaluation of the fair value of goodwill 
the goodwill analysis did not result in an impairment charge  as the estimated fair value of the reporting unit continues to exceed the carrying value by such a significant amount that any reasonably likely change in the assumptions used in the analysis  including revenue growth rates and the discount rate  would not cause the carrying value to exceed the estimated fair value for the reporting unit as determined under the step one goodwill impairment analysis 
indefinite lived intangible assets the company s indefinite lived intangible assets consist of five unamortized trade names with an aggregate carrying value of approximately management utilizes significant assumptions to estimate the fair value of these unamortized trade names using a fair value model based on discounted future cash flows in accordance with us gaap 
future cash flows associated with each of the company s unamortized trade names are calculated by applying a theoretical royalty rate a willing third party would pay for use of the particular trade name to estimated future net sales 
the present value of the resulting after tax cash flow is management s current estimate of the fair value of the trade names 
this fair value model requires management to make several significant assumptions  including estimated future net sales  the royalty rate  and the discount rate 
future net sales and short term growth or decline rates are estimated for each particular trade name based on management s forecasted financial results  which consider key business drivers  such as specific revenue growth initiatives  market share changes  expected growth or decline in non residential and residential construction markets  and general 
table of contents economic factors  such as credit availability and interest rates 
the long term growth rate used in determining terminal value is estimated at slightly less than for the company and is primarily based on the company s understanding of projections for expected long term growth in non residential construction  the company s key market  and historical long term performance 
the theoretical royalty rate is estimated primarily using management s assumptions regarding the amount a willing third party would pay to use the particular trade name and is compared with market information for similar intellectual property within and outside of the industry 
differences between expected and actual results can result in significantly different valuations 
if future operating results are unfavorable compared with forecasted amounts  the company may be required to reduce the theoretical royalty rate used in the fair value model 
a reduction in the theoretical royalty rate would result in lower expected future after tax cash flow in the valuation model 
the company utilized a range of estimated discount rates between and as of june   based on the capital asset pricing model  which considers the updated risk free interest rate  beta  market risk premium  and entity specific size premium 
during fiscal  the company performed an evaluation of the fair value of its five unamortized trade names 
the company s expected revenues are based on the company s fiscal expectations and recent lighting market growth or decline estimates for fiscal through the company also included revenue growth estimates based on current initiatives expected to help the company improve performance 
during fiscal  estimated theoretical royalty rates ranged between and 
the indefinite lived intangible asset analysis did not result in an impairment charge  as the fair values exceeded the carrying values for each trade name by a significant amount 
the estimated fair values of the indefinite lived intangible assets exceed the carrying values by such a significant amount that any reasonably likely change in the assumptions used in the analyses  including revenue growth rates and the discount rate  would not cause the carrying values to exceed the estimated fair values as determined by the fair value analyses 
the company determined that any estimated potential impairment related to the trade names based on changes in the assumptions that would be less likely to occur would not be material to the company s financial results  trend of earnings  or financial position 
self insurance the company self insures  up to certain limits  traditional risks including workers compensation  comprehensive general liability  and auto liability 
the company s self insured retention for each claim involving workers compensation  comprehensive general liability including product liability claims  and auto liability is limited to per occurrence of such claims 
a provision for claims under this self insured program  based on the company s estimate of the aggregate liability for claims incurred  is revised and recorded annually 
the estimate is derived from both internal and external sources including but not limited to the company s independent actuary 
the company is also self insured up to certain limits for certain other insurable risks  primarily physical loss to property per occurrence and business interruptions resulting from such loss lasting two days or more in duration 
insurance coverage is maintained for catastrophic property and casualty exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract 
the company is fully self insured for certain other types of liabilities  including environmental  product recall  and patent infringement 
the actuarial estimates calculated are subject to uncertainty from various sources  including  among others  changes in claim reporting patterns  claim settlement patterns  judicial decisions  legislation  and economic conditions 
although the company believes that the actuarial estimates are reasonable  significant differences related to the items noted above could materially affect the company s self insurance obligations  future expense and cash flow 
the company is also self insured for the majority of its medical benefit plans with individual claims limited to the company estimates its aggregate liability for claims incurred by applying a lag factor to the company s historical claims and administrative cost experience 
the appropriateness of the company s lag factor is evaluated and revised  if necessary  annually 
although management believes that the current estimates are reasonable  significant differences related to claim reporting patterns  plan designs  legislation  and general economic conditions could materially affect the company s medical benefit plan liabilities  future expense and cash flow 
income taxes the company uses certain assumptions and estimates in determining the income taxes payable or refundable for the current year  income tax expense  and deferred income tax liabilities and assets  which represent temporary and permanent differences between amounts within the financial statements and the income tax basis 
asc  income taxes asc  requires the evaluation and testing of the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the relevant factors  it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
reasonable judgment and estimates are required in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary and  if so  the amount of such valuation allowance 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  the company considers a number of factors  including  but not limited to the nature and character of the deferred tax assets and liabilities  taxable income in prior carryback years  future reversals of existing temporary differences  and the length of time carryovers can be utilized 
in light of the multiple tax jurisdictions in which the company operates  the company s tax returns are subject to routine 
table of contents audit by the internal revenue service irs and other taxation authorities 
these audits at times produce uncertainty regarding particular tax positions taken in the year s of review 
the company records uncertain tax positions as prescribed by asc  which requires recognition at the time when it is more likely than not that the position in question will be upheld 
although management believes that the judgment and estimates involved are reasonable and that the necessary provisions have been recorded  changes in circumstances or unexpected events could adversely affect the company s financial position  results from operations  and cash flows 
retirement benefits the company sponsors domestic and international defined benefit pension plans and domestic defined contribution plans and other postretirement plans 
assumptions are used to determine the estimated fair value of plan assets  the actuarial value of plan liabilities  and the current and projected costs for these employee benefit plans and include  among other factors  estimated discount rates  expected returns on the pension fund assets  estimated mortality rates  and the rates of increase in employee compensation levels 
these assumptions are determined based on company and market data and are evaluated annually as of the plans measurement date 
see the pensions and profit sharing plans footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on the company s plans 
share based compensation expense the company recognizes compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions in the financial statements based on the estimated fair value of the equity or liability instrument issued 
the company accounts for stock options  restricted shares  and share units representing certain deferrals into the director deferred compensation plan or the supplemental deferred savings plan both of which are discussed further in the share based payments footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements using the modified prospective method 
under the modified prospective method  share based expense recognized includes a share based expense for all awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of september   based on the grant date fair value estimated under the previous guidance  and b share based expense for all awards granted subsequent to september   based on the grant date fair value estimated under the current provisions of asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc 
the company recorded   and of share based expense in continuing operations for the years ended august    and  respectively 
the company employs the black scholes model in deriving the fair value estimates of share based awards and records estimates of forfeitures of share based awards at the time of grant  which are revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience 
if factors change causing different assumptions to be made in future periods  estimated compensation expense may differ significantly from that recorded in the current period 
see the summary of significant accounting policies and share based payments footnotes of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of stock options 
product warranty and recall costs the company records an allowance for the estimated amount of future warranty or recall costs when the related revenue is recognized  primarily based on historical experience of identified warranty claims 
historical warranty costs have been within expectations  however  there can be no assurance that future warranty costs will not exceed historical amounts 
if actual future warranty or recall costs exceed historical amounts  additional allowances may be required  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results and cash flow in future periods 
litigation the company recognizes expense for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
due to the difficulty in estimating costs of resolving legal claims  actual costs may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved 
environmental matters the company recognizes expense for known environmental claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
the actual cost of resolving environmental issues may be higher or lower than that reserved primarily due to difficulty in estimating such costs and potential changes in the status of government regulations 
the company is self insured for environmental matters

risk factors of this annual report on form k  and are specifically incorporated herein by reference 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
the company is exposed to worldwide market risks that may impact the consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of income  and consolidated statements of cash flows due primarily to changing interest and foreign exchange rates as well as volatility in commodity prices 
the following discussion provides additional information regarding the market risks of acuity brands 
interest rates 
interest rate fluctuations expose the variable rate debt of the company to changes in interest expense and cash flows 
at august   the variable rate debt of the company was solely comprised of the long term industrial revenue bond 
a increase in market interest rates at august   would have resulted in a de minimus amount of additional annual after tax interest expense 
a fluctuation in interest rates would not affect interest expense or cash flows related to the company s fixed rate debt which includes the publicly traded fixed rate notes 
a increase in market interest rates at august   would have decreased the estimated fair value of these debt obligations by approximately see the debt and lines of credit footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in this form k  for additional information regarding the company s debt 
foreign exchange rates 
the majority of net sales  expense  and capital purchases of the company are transacted in us dollars 
however  exposure with respect to foreign exchange rate fluctuation exists due to the company s operations in canada  where a significant portion of products sold are sourced from the united states 
a hypothetical increase in the canadian dollar of would negatively impact operating profit by approximately in addition to products and services sold in mexico  a significant portion of the goods sold in the united states are manufactured in mexico 
a hypothetical increase in the mexican peso would negatively impact operating profits by approximately the impact of these hypothetical currency fluctuations has been calculated in isolation from any response the company would undertake to address such exchange rate changes in the company s foreign markets 
commodity prices 
the company utilizes a variety of raw materials and components in its production process including petroleum based products  steel  and aluminum 
in fiscal  the company purchased approximately  tons of steel and aluminum 
the company estimates that less than of the raw materials purchased are petroleum based and that approximately four million gallons of diesel fuel were consumed in fiscal failure to effectively manage future increases in the costs of these items could adversely affect the ability to maintain or increase operating margins
