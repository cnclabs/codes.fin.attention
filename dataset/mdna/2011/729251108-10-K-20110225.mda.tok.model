overview operating performance compared to our operating income for of million was million lower than our operating income 
our operations continue to be negatively impacted by near record low housing starts  low consumer confidence  declining home values  high unemployment and the difficulties associated with obtaining financing for home and real estate purchases 
despite these challenges  we reported higher operating income in our northern and southern resources segments and our manufactured products segment  offset by lower operating income in our real estate segment 
much of the improvement in earnings in our timber and manufacturing businesses during was due to improved product prices due to moderately increasing demand combined with tightness in the supply chain  which may not reoccur in operating income in our northern resources segment increased by million from an operating loss of million in to operating income of million in this increase in earnings was due primarily to higher sawlog prices as a result of improved demand and low mill log inventories 
operating income in our southern resources segment increased by million from operating income of million in to million in this improvement in earnings was due primarily to a temporary increase in pulpwood prices as a result of weather related log shortages and increasing the percentage of sawlogs included in our total harvest 
operating income in our manufactured products segment increased by million from an operating loss of million in to operating income of million in during  we significantly downsized our manufacturing operations which resulted in impairments  write downs  severance and pension settlement expense of million 
during  we benefited from a temporary shortage associated with the restocking of supply chain inventories and our plywood and mdf mills additionally benefited from a temporary supply shortage as a result of the earthquake in chile 
operating income in our real estate segment decreased by million from operating income of million in to operating income of million in this decrease in earnings was due primarily to a large conservation sale during plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item during  we recorded a tax benefit of million compared to a tax provision of million in this decrease in our tax benefit was due primarily to improved manufacturing results and a favorable tax law change in liquidity we believe we have a strong balance sheet and do not foresee any liquidity issues during at december   we had cash of million and million available for borrowing on our line of credit 
during  we reduced our total debt outstanding by almost million and we refinanced upcoming debt maturities at favorable interest rates by issuing million of senior notes at 
we expect cash provided by operating activities in to decline from the million we generated in due primarily to lower proceeds from real estate sales 
we believe the lower cash from operating activities will be more than adequate to fund our current dividend approximately million and planned capital expenditures million to million 
we expect to fund scheduled long term debt principal payments million with cash on hand or borrowings on our line of credit 
key economic factors impacting our resources and manufactured products business our operating performance for the resources and manufactured products segments is impacted primarily by the supply and demand for logs and wood products in the united states 
the short term supply of logs is impacted primarily by weather and the level of harvesting activities 
the demand for logs and wood products in the united states is impacted by housing starts  repair and remodeling activities  industrial activity and the amount of imported lumber  primarily from canada 
selected us housing economic data for the last five years was as follows at december us housing starts in millions supply of existing homes for sale in months yr 
fixed interest mortgage rates average the recession in the united states officially ended in and the economy continued to improve during the us economy is once again expanding and the unemployment rate is beginning to slowly decline  although the rate is expected to remain high for the next several years 
these economic conditions along with low interest rates  a weak us dollar  and favorable demographics are expected to bode well for the wood products business in the long run 
however  there remains considerable uncertainty regarding whether we will experience any improvement in the demand or prices for our logs or wood products during due to near record low housing starts  an excess supply of homes for sale  declining home values  high unemployment and strict lending requirements 
housing starts during were estimated to be  which was only a slight improvement over the record low housing starts of  lowest since in the prior year 
housing starts for are only expected to improve modestly and will remain well below the long term expected annual rate of million to million starts until there is a significant decline in both the number of homes for sale and the unemployment rate 
there is currently an eight month supply of new and existing homes for sale which is well above the historical average four month supply 
the supply of homes for sale could increase in the future due to a potential increase in foreclosures and the timing of these homes being placed on the market 
in addition to weak housing starts  the demand for wood products in the repair and remodeling sector has remained weak 
repair and remodeling activity is down approximately from its peak earlier in the decade and is expected to improve only modestly during due primarily to declining home values  high unemployment  low consumer confidence and strict lending standards 
the low housing starts and repair and remodeling activity has reduced lumber demand and therefore log demand 
this has resulted in weak pricing for the logs and wood products we sell 
we expect the prices for our logs and wood products to remain weak until there is a significant improvement in the number of us housing starts  reduced levels of unemployment and a decline in the number of homes for sale 
we use independent third party contract loggers and haulers to deliver our logs to our customers 
as weak business conditions in the timber business have persisted for several years  there are fewer loggers and haulers available in certain markets to produce logs 
while we have maintained strong working relationships with our loggers and haulers  when log markets improve there may be production and delivery constraints that could impact log prices and  potentially  our ability to benefit from these conditions by delivering logs 
plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item over the past several years  fuel prices have fluctuated significantly 
our timber and manufacturing operations are significantly impacted by changing fuel prices 
in  our operating income was negatively affected by million compared to due mostly to rising fuel costs 
during  operating income in our timber business was million higher compared to the prior year due to lower fuel prices 
during  our operating income in our timber business was negatively impacted by million compared to due to higher fuel prices 
oil prices have recently increased and could negatively impact our operating results 
for example  national diesel prices averaged per gallon during  whereas national diesel prices averaged per gallon at the end of and per gallon in february higher value and non strategic timberlands from time to time  we review our timberlands to identify properties that may have higher values other than as commercial timberlands see discussion in item real estate segment 
we estimate that included in the company s million acres of timberlands at december   are approximately million acres of higher value timberlands which are expected to be sold  exchanged  and or developed over the next years for recreational  conservation or residential purposes 
included within the million acres of higher value timberlands are approximately  acres we expect to sell for recreational uses  approximately  acres we expect to sell for conservation and approximately  acres that are identified as having development potential 
furthermore  the company has approximately  acres of non strategic timberlands  which are expected to be sold over the near and medium term in smaller scale transactions small non strategic 
in addition to these  acres  we may make opportunistic sales of non strategic timberlands in larger blocks to commercial timberland buyers large non strategic 
some of our real estate activities  including our real estate development business  are conducted through our wholly owned taxable reit subsidiaries 
in the meantime  all of our timberlands continue to be managed productively in our business of growing and selling timber 
during  we sold approximately  acres of conservation properties for million compared to selling approximately  acres for million in the primary reason for the decrease in conservation sales was due to the three phase sale of  acres in montana for million 
the third phase covering approximately  acres for proceeds of million closed during  preceded by the second phase covering approximately  acres for proceeds of million in the first phase covering approximately  acres for proceeds of million closed in during  we sold approximately  acres of small non strategic timberlands  approximately  acres for conservation purposes including approximately  acres in connection with the third phase of our montana sale  approximately  acres of higher and better use recreational properties  and approximately  acres of large non strategic timberlands for total proceeds of million 
during  we may adjust the type and geographic location of properties sold to respond to areas with active markets 
we expect revenues from real estate sales to range between million and million  which may include timberlands that are less strategic to the company large non strategic sales 
our land development business slowed dramatically starting in and has since remained weak 
we expect proceeds from the sale of real estate development properties in to be comparable to the million we recognized during we expect our real estate development business to remain weak until there is a significant improvement in consumer confidence  real estate values begin appreciating and financing becomes available for such properties 
harvest levels the volume of trees we harvest each year and the percentage of sawlogs and pulpwood product mix included in our annual harvest also impact our operating performance 
during  we harvested a total of million tons compared to a total of million tons during we expect total harvest levels and product mix to be comparable to our total harvest levels and product mix 
while the company has flexibility to modify our annual harvest volumes  based on market conditions  we expect harvest levels to increase approximately over the near term next five years and more than over the long term ten years 
future harvest levels may vary from historic or expected levels due to weaker or stronger than anticipated markets or other factors outside of our control  such as weather and fires 
future harvest levels may also be impacted by the acquisition of timberlands or the disposition of timberlands beyond the million acres described above in the higher value and non strategic timberlands section 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
under different assumptions or conditions  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition for timber sales timber sales revenues are recognized when legal ownership and the risk of loss transfer to the purchaser and the quantity sold is determinable 
we sell timber under delivered log agreements and through sales of standing timber or stumpage using pay as cut sales contracts or timber deed sale agreements 
delivered log sales 
under a delivered log sale agreement  we harvest the timber and deliver it to the buyer 
revenue is recognized when the log is delivered as risk of loss and title transfer to the buyer 
with delivered log sales  we incur the cost of logging and hauling 
pay as cut sales contracts 
pay as cut sales contracts are agreements in which the buyer agrees to purchase and harvest specified timber on a tract of land for an agreed upon price for each type of tree over the term of the contract usually to months 
in some cases  an advance is received in connection with pay as cut sales contracts 
in other cases  the buyer agrees to harvest only certain trees on a tract of land 
under pay as cut sales contracts  the buyer is responsible for all logging and hauling costs 
revenue is recognized when the timber is harvested  as title and risk of loss has transferred to the buyer 
total revenue recognized under a pay as cut sales contract is the total volume of wood removed multiplied by the unit price for each type of tree 
timber deeds 
timber deed sales are agreements in which the buyer agrees to purchase and harvest specified timber ie mature pulpwood and or sawlogs on a tract of land over the term of the contract usually less than months 
unlike a pay as cut sales contract  risk of loss and title to the trees transfer to the buyer when the contract is signed 
the buyer pays the full purchase price when the contract is signed and we do not have any additional performance obligations 
under a timber deed  the buyer is responsible for all logging and hauling costs and the timing of such activity 
revenue from a timber deed sale is recognized when the contract is signed because the earnings process is complete 
timber deeds are generally marketed and sold to the highest bidder 
bids are typically based on a timber cruise which is an estimate of the total volume of timber on a tract of land broken down by the various types of trees such as softwood sawlogs  hardwood pulpwood  etc total revenue recognized under a timber deed is not dependent upon the volume or types of trees actually harvested 
the following table summarizes amounts recognized under each method from sales to external customers in the company s consolidated financial statements for the years ended december in millions revenues from delivered log sales pay as cut sales timber deed sales substantially all of our timber sales in the northern resources segment are under delivered log sale agreements 
in our southern resources segment  approximately of our timber sales in and of our timber sales in consisted of pay as cut sales contracts or timber deed sales 
since under sales of stumpage the buyer is responsible for the logging and hauling costs  the operating profit as a percentage of revenue is typically higher in our southern resources segment 
real estate sales the timing of real estate sales is a function of many factors  including the general state of the economy  demand in local real estate markets  the ability to obtain entitlements  the ability of buyers to obtain financing  the number of competing properties listed for sale  the seasonal nature of sales particularly in the northern states  the plans of adjacent landowners  our expectation of future price appreciation  the timing of harvesting activities  and the availability of government and not for profit funding especially for conservation sales 
as a result  the timing of our real estate sales may materially impact our reported operating income and net income 
plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item during  the real estate segment reported an operating profit percentage of approximately 
we estimate our real estate segment s annual operating profit percentage could range from to of revenues 
the operating profit percentage depends on the nature of the interest sold and how much the market value of the property has risen over its book value 
for example  sales of properties that have been held by the company for a long time ie decades will tend to have relatively higher operating profit percentages than properties that have been held by the company for shorter time periods 
in contrast  the sale of conservation easements will generally have an operating profit percentage of close to because historically no book basis was allocated to these types of sales 
in general  timberlands are acquired primarily for long term use in our timber operations 
in connection with timberland acquisitions  we are generally not able to identify  with any level of precision  our future real estate sales ie specific properties with a higher value than for use in timber production 
however  our purchase price allocation and related appraisals for these acquisitions may reflect greater values for real estate which may be sold in the future but are not yet specifically identified 
therefore  in connection with our purchase price allocation for timberland acquisitions  the greater values for real estate are allocated proportionately among all of the acres acquired 
specific properties cannot be identified in advance because their value is dependent upon numerous factors  most of which are not known at the acquisition date  including current and future zoning restrictions  current and future environmental restrictions  future changes in demographics  future changes in the economy  current and future plans of adjacent landowners  and current and future funding of government and not for profit conservation and recreation programs 
we believe that current and future results of operations could be materially different under different purchase price allocation assumptions 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our ability to recover the net investment in long lived assets when required by the accounting standards 
we recognize an impairment loss in connection with long lived assets used in our business when the carrying value net book value of the assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to those assets over their expected useful life 
impairment losses are measured by the extent to which the carrying value of a group of assets exceeds the fair value of such assets at a given point in time 
generally  our fair value measurements used in calculating an impairment loss are categorized as level measurements ie unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity under the fair value hierarchy in the accounting standards codification 
typically  we will use a discounted cash flow model or an external appraisal to estimate the fair value of the affected assets 
furthermore  we recognize an impairment loss in connection with long lived assets held for sale when the carrying value of the assets exceeds an amount equal to their fair value less selling costs 
the company has had a long history of acquiring timberlands 
management is required to estimate the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date 
subsequent to the original allocation  assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable through future operations 
our long lived assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level for which there are independent cash flows 
we track cash flows for our million acres of timberlands by grouping them into seven geographic areas in the northern resources segment and six geographic areas in the southern resources segment 
additionally  we track cash flows for each of our eight manufacturing facilities 
timber and timberlands used in our business 
for assets used in our business  an impairment loss is recorded only when the carrying value of those assets is not recoverable through future operations 
the recoverability test is based on undiscounted future cash flows over the expected life of the assets 
we use one harvest cycle which ranges between and years for evaluating the recoverability of our timber and timberlands 
because of the inherently long life of timber and timberlands  we do not expect to incur an impairment loss in the future for the timber and timberlands used in our timber business 
timber and timberlands held for sale 
an impairment loss is recognized for long lived assets held for sale when the carrying value of those assets exceeds an amount equal to its fair value less selling costs 
an asset is generally considered to be held for sale when we have committed to a plan to sell the asset  the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition  we have initiated an active program to locate a buyer eg  listed with a broker  and the sale is expected to close within one year 
during  the above criteria were met by a number of our timberland properties  and we recognized impairment losses of million for certain of these properties 
similarly  we recognized impairment losses of million and million in and  respectively  in connection with timberlands held for sale see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we expect to continue to sell or exchange timberlands to other forest products companies or non industrial buyers  and it is probable that we will recognize additional impairment losses in the future in connection with sales of timberlands 
plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item an impairment loss is generally not recorded until management expects that timberlands will be sold within the next months 
for many properties that are currently listed for sale  it is difficult to conclude whether they will be sold within one year and to estimate the price 
nevertheless  management performs a probability assessment for all properties that are listed for sale and records an impairment loss to the extent the property s book basis exceeds its estimated fair value net of selling cost in the quarter in which management expects the property will be sold within twelve months 
property  plant and equipment 
the carrying value of property  plant and equipment represents primarily the net book value of our eight two of which are indefinitely curtailed manufacturing facilities 
each manufacturing facility is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable through future operations 
the estimated future cash flows over the remaining useful life of a manufacturing facility is highly subjective and is dependent upon estimates for future product pricing  raw material costs and availability  volumes of product sold  and residual value of the facility 
no impairment losses were recorded during during the first quarter of  as a result of an analysis to rationalize and consolidate its lumber operations  the company recorded an impairment charge of million related to certain lumber manufacturing assets 
during  we recognized an impairment loss of million in connection with our lumber manufacturing assets 
we currently estimate that the carrying value for our eight facilities is recoverable through future operations and that our estimate of future cash flows is reasonable 
however  if wood product prices were to remain weak at current levels for an extended period of time  or if log or raw material availability declines  the company may be required to record an impairment loss for one or more of its manufacturing facilities in a future period 
capitalized real estate development costs 
current and future costs associated with specific real estate development projects are capitalized once management has concluded it is probable that a project will be successful 
real estate development costs are expensed as incurred when management is not able to conclude that it is probable a project will be successful 
furthermore  previously capitalized costs for specific projects are written off when management revises its prior assessment and concludes that it is probable a project will not be successful and costs will not be recovered 
for many of our projects  there is less judgment in making this determination due to prior experience in the local market or advice from consultants 
however  for some of our larger projects where we have limited experience in the local market or for projects in environmentally sensitive areas  there is significant judgment in assessing the expected outcome for the projects 
at december   we have million of capitalized costs associated with projects that management expects will be successful 
of these capitalized costs  approximately million represent costs for a single project that has been approved by a state commission but is being appealed in court by groups opposed to the project 
while not expected  if the approval is reversed  some or all of these capitalized costs could be written off in the next twelve months 
depletion depletion  or costs attributed to timber harvested  is recorded as trees are harvested 
depletion rates for each geographic area are adjusted at least annually 
depletion rates are computed by dividing a the sum of the original cost of the timber less previously recorded depletion plus estimated future silviculture costs  including the impact of inflation  that are expected to be incurred over the next harvest cycle  by b the total timber volume that is estimated to be harvested over the harvest cycle 
the harvest cycle can be as short as years in the south to as long as years in the north 
the estimate of future silviculture costs is limited to the expenditures that are expected to impact growth rates over the harvest cycle 
the depletion rate calculations do not include an estimate for either future reforestation costs associated with a stand s final harvest or future volume in connection with the replanting of a stand subsequent to its final harvest 
plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item the following table summarizes depletion expense recognized in the company s financial statements  key assumptions and sensitivities to changes in assumptions for the years ended december dollars in millions  except per ton amounts depletion expense northern resources segment southern resources segment total depletion expense average depletion rates per ton northern resources segment southern resources segment assumptions used to determine the average depletion rates estimated future silviculture costs  including the impact of inflation northern resources segment southern resources segment a estimated future volume in million tons northern resources segment southern resources segment b sensitivity of results to changes in key assumptions increase in depletion expense for a increase in estimated future silviculture costs c northern resources segment southern resources segment decrease in estimated future volume d northern resources segment southern resources segment a reflects an increase in our estimates of future costs associated with fertilization treatments due to higher chemical and application costs and more acres treated 
b increase from is due primarily to an increase in our estimate of rotation length for certain stands and improved growth rates 
c assumes future timber volumes do not change 
d assumes future silviculture costs do not change 
significant estimates and judgments are required to determine both future silviculture costs and the volume of timber available for harvest over the harvest cycle 
some of the factors impacting the estimates are changes in inflation rates  the cost of fertilizers and chemicals  the cost of capital  the actual and estimated increase in growth rates from fertilizer applications  the relative price of sawlogs and pulpwood  the actual and expected real price appreciation of timber  the scientific advancement in seedling and growing technology  and changes in harvest cycles 
we have invested in technology that enables us to predict our current standing inventory of trees  future growth rates  and the benefits of scientific advancements in connection with seedlings  planting techniques and fertilizer applications 
therefore  while estimates with respect to depletion computations will be revised at least annually  we do not expect the depletion rates will change materially from year to year 
accounting for share based compensation plum creek has a stockholder approved stock incentive plan that provides for the award of non qualified stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units  value management awards and dividend equivalents 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item grants of value management awards are classified and accounted for as liabilities 
as a result  the expense recognized over the performance period will equal the fair value ie  cash value of an award as of the last day of the performance period multiplied by the number of awards that are earned 
furthermore  the quarterly expense recognized during the performance period is based on the fair value as of the end of the most recent quarter 
prior to the end of the performance period  compensation cost for value management awards is based on the awards most recent quarterly fair values and the number of months of service rendered during the performance period 
fair values for value management awards are computed based on our historical relative total shareholder return and simulated relative total shareholder return compared to the performance of peer groups consisting of forest products companies  the s p index and the morgan stanley reit index over the same period peer group 
the simulated total shareholder return of the company and the peer group is computed using a monte carlo simulation 
the key assumptions used in the simulation of the company s and the peer group s total shareholder return are volatility  beta the measure of how plum creek s stock moves relative to the market as a whole and risk free interest rate 
the fair value of the liability for outstanding value management awards at december  was million  which is based on the current fair value of outstanding awards multiplied by the percentage of months that services were provided during the performance period 
the liability at december  could range between and million based on the possible fair value of all outstanding liability based awards 
we could have a material adjustment to our share based compensation liability to the extent there is a material change in the fair value of our value management awards during the quarter 
pensions plum creek provides pension benefits under defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all of our employees 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan and two supplemental non qualified defined benefit pension plans 
participants benefits vest after three years of service 
the cash balance benefits for salaried employees is determined based primarily on certain percentages of compensation  age  years of service and interest accrued based on the year treasury bond rate 
participants who were employees of the company on september   earn benefits based on the greater of the cash balance benefits or a monthly pension benefit that is principally based on the highest monthly average earnings during any consecutive sixty month out of the last month period and the number of years of service credit 
the benefits to hourly employees are generally based on a fixed amount per year of service 
plum creek s contributions to its qualified pension plan vary from year to year  but the company has made at least the minimum contributions required by law in each year 
it is generally the company s policy to fund the qualified pension plan annually such that the fair value of plan assets equals or exceeds the actuarially computed accumulated benefit obligation the approximate actuarially computed current pension obligation if the plan was discontinued over a market cycle generally to years 
the company has the same funding policy for the non qualified plan 
however  assets related to the non qualified plans are held in a grantor trust and are subject to the claims of creditors and  therefore  are not considered plan assets 
the computation of the company s benefit obligation  pension cost and accrued pension liability under us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make certain assumptions involving primarily the following weighted average rates assumptions used to determine the benefit obligation at december discount rates a annuity distributions lump sum distributions rate of compensation increase b assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost discount rate annuity distributions lump sum distributions expected long term return on plan assets c rate of compensation increase b plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item a the december  discount rate for annuity distributions was determined by the resulting yield of a hypothetical bond portfolio at december   matched to the expected benefit payments under the plans 
bonds selected for this portfolio had a moody s or standard poor s credit rating of aa or better as of december  the december  discount rate for lump sum distributions is based on yields on year us treasury bonds 
b the assumed rate of increase of future compensation levels represents our long term estimate of such increases on the basis of the composition of plan participants  past results and market expectations 
c the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption is based on the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds  the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns on each asset class 
the expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption for the portfolio 
since pension benefits may be settled in either a single lump sum or an annuity distribution  both the estimated percentage of participants electing a lump sum payment and the assumed interest rate discount rate used in computing the lump sum benefit are key assumptions 
management currently estimates that approximately half of the qualified plan participants will elect a lump sum distribution upon termination 
other key assumptions used in the estimate include primarily those underlying the mortality table  and expected long term rates for inflation  retirement and withdrawals  all of which are based on plan experience and standard actuarial methods but which are nevertheless subject to uncertainty 
it is likely that the actual return on plan assets and the outcome of other uncertain variables will differ from those used in estimating our pension costs and pension obligation 
furthermore  the company may  from time to time  adjust the asset allocation  which may have an impact on the long term rate of return on plan assets 
the following table summarizes key financial measures and sensitivities to changes in assumptions for the years ended december in millions key financial measures pension expense a cash pension plan contributions qualified plan cash grantor trust funding supplemental plans current accrued pension liability non current accrued pension liability sensitivity to changes in key assumptions increase in pension expense for every percentage point decrease in long term rate of return on plan assets decrease in weighted average discount rate increase in rate of increase in compensation levels increase in qualified pension funding actuarially computed accumulated benefit obligation for every percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate every percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate assumption for lump sum benefits a pension expense for includes a million settlement loss recorded as a result of lump sum distributions for the year ended december  the settlement loss represents a partial recognition of the actuarial pension loss reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
assuming an average long term rate of return on plan assets of  and weighted average discount rates of for annuity distributions and for lump sum distributions for and beyond  and a rate of increase in compensation levels  we project our annual pension expense for will be approximately million and will range between million and million each year for through over the same time periods  the annual cash plum creek form k

at december   other long term liabilities include workers compensation of million  deferred compensation obligations of million and non qualified pension obligations of million including million classified as a current liability 
we expect to fund approximately million for workers compensation payments in we have two grantor trusts  which hold assets associated with our deferred compensation obligations and non qualified pension obligations 
at december   the fair value of assets in one of our grantor trusts is approximately equal to our deferred compensation obligation of million 
the december  fair value of assets in the other grantor trust was approximately million and the actuarially plum creek form k

see notes and of the consolidated notes to financial statements 
events and trends affecting operating results harvest plans we determine our annual timber sawlogs and pulpwood  including stumpage sales harvesting plans based on a number of factors 
at the stand level  ranging in size from to acres  we consider the age  size  density  health and economic maturity of the timber 
a stand is a contiguous block of trees of a similar age  species mix or silvicultural regime 
at the forest level  ranging in size from  to almost million acres  we consider the long term sustainability and environmental impact of certain levels of harvesting  certain external conditions such as supply agreements  and the level of demand for wood within the region 
a forest is a broad administrative unit  made up of a large number of stands 
harvest scheduling is the technical approach using computer modeling that considers all of the above factors along with forest growth rates and financial assumptions to project future harvest plans for a number of years forward 
our actual harvest levels may vary from planned levels due to log demand  sales prices  the availability of timber from other sources  the level of timberland sales and acquisitions  the availability of legal access  abnormal weather conditions  fires and other factors outside of our control 
we believe that our harvest plans are sufficiently flexible to permit modification in response to short term fluctuations in the markets for logs 
furthermore  future harvest levels will be impacted by sales and purchases of timberlands 
the impact will depend on the level and extent we are able to reinvest proceeds in productive timberlands and the stocking levels and age class distribution of any newly acquired timberlands 
northern resources segment 
harvest levels were million tons sawlogs and pulpwood during and million tons sawlogs and pulpwood during pulpwood harvest volumes were lower in compared to the prior year due primarily to temporary increases in harvest levels in prior years to capture favorable pulpwood prices 
we expect harvest levels and product mix ie  the percentage of sawlogs vs 
pulpwood to be comparable to our harvest levels and product mix 
while the company has flexibility to modify our annual harvest volumes  based on market conditions  we expect harvest levels beyond to be at moderately higher levels over the near term next five years and increase more than over the long term ten years and beyond and we expect the product mix to improve to approximately sawlogs

conservation sales in the real estate segment during  we signed an agreement to sell approximately  acres of timberlands in montana in our northern resources segment for million in three phases 
as a result  our revenues and cash flows for the years in which each closing occurred were significantly improved by this multi phase transaction

table of contents part ii item manufactured products segment production levels the results of our manufactured products segment are driven largely by the strength of the us housing market  which has been declining since although housing starts improved modestly in from a increase  current levels of approximately  starts per year remain significantly below historical averages achieved in the previous decade of approximately million starts per year 
during  we permanently closed two lumber mills  indefinitely suspended production at one additional lumber mill and one remanufacturing facility and reduced production at another lumber mill 
we have also reduced production at our mdf and plywood facilities in response to the decline in demand 
during  we continued to operate all of our manufactured products facilities at reduced levels similar to until markets for wood products improve  our expected production levels and sales volumes will be significantly lower than both the combined capacity of our facilities and historical operating rates 
us canada softwood lumber agreement historically  canada has been a significant source of lumber for the us market  particularly in the new home construction market 
in  the softwood lumber agreement sla was signed by the us and canada establishing a system of tiered taxes and or volume restrictions that will be in effect for a period of seven years 
generally  the sla provides that no import restrictions would be imposed on canadian lumber shipments to the us when the published composite price for lumber is higher than per thousand board feet 
below that level  a system of tiered export tax and or volume restrictions would be triggered 
the impact of the taxes could be mitigated by fluctuations in the rate of exchange between us and canadian dollars 
notwithstanding the signing of the sla between the us and canadian governments  there can be no assurance it will effectively create a fair trade environment 
therefore  when demand for wood products in the us improves  downward pressure on domestic timber and lumber prices caused by canadian imports could increase 
comparability of financial statement periods acquisitions and divestitures 
we have pursued and expect to continue to pursue both the acquisition and divestiture of timberlands to increase the value of our assets 
there were no significant timberland acquisitions during and during  we acquired  acres of timberlands  located primarily in georgia  vermont and oregon 
during  we sold approximately  acres of timberland  during  we sold approximately  acres of timberland  and during we sold approximately  acres 
additionally during  approximately  acres located in the southern resources segment were contributed to a timberland venture in exchange for an equity interest 
as a result of these timberland transactions  our ownership was approximately million acres at december   approximately million acres at december   and approximately million acres at december  accordingly  the comparability of periods covered by the company s financial statements is  and in the future may be  affected by the impact of timberland acquisitions and divestitures

sawlog prices were higher in compared to the increase was due primarily to improvement in demand during the spring building season as a result of low mill log inventories and improving lumber and plywood prices 
additionally  sawlog prices in the northwestern us have also been favorably impacted by increased lumber production compared to and improved export demand for sawlogs primarily from china 
however  sawlog prices remained relatively weak during most of due to near record low housing starts as a result of an excess supply of homes for sale and high unemployment 
pulpwood harvest volumes were lower due primarily to temporary increases in harvest levels in prior years to capture favorable pulpwood prices

sawlog harvest volumes increased by approximately  tons  or  and pulpwood harvest volumes decreased by approximately  tons  or  compared to due primarily to a shift in standing inventory 
during the past several years  we have concentrated on thinning young timber stands ie first thinnings to maintain vigorous growth rates and to capture favorable pulpwood prices 
the timber harvested from these first thinnings is predominately pulpwood 
during  a greater proportion of our harvest volume was from more mature timber stands that contained both pulpwood and small diameter sawlogs 
in  we expect harvest volumes and product mix ie the percentage of sawlogs vs 
pulpwood to be comparable to our harvest volumes and product mix 
pulpwood prices were higher on a stumpage basis higher on a delivered basis during compared to the prior year due primarily to a temporary shortage of logs and improved demand 
throughout most of the us south  pulpwood was in short supply during the first half of due to extremely wet weather conditions 
however  as a result of our extensive ownership  we were able to deliver logs when other timberland owners had to curtail log production 
during  the demand for pulpwood remained favorable due primarily to the improvement in global economic conditions  a reduced supply of wood chips from solid wood products manufacturers  and the temporary supply chain disruption of market pulp as a result of the february earthquake in chile 
nevertheless  pulpwood prices during the fourth quarter of declined to per ton  the same average sales price realized during the fourth quarter of due to favorable harvesting conditions dry weather and high mill log inventories 
sawlog prices were generally weak during most of due to near record low housing starts as a result of an excess supply of homes for sale and high unemployment

conservation sales vary significantly from period to period and are primarily impacted by government and not for profit funding  the limited number of conservation buyers  and the timing of our transactions 
additionally  the price per acre for conservation properties can vary significantly due to the geographic location and the rationale for the conservation designation 
the increase in small non strategic acres sold during compared to was due primarily to an unusually large sale during when a collection of approximately  acres were sold to a single buyer 
from time to time  we may dispose of large blocks of timberlands to maximize value large non strategic such as the  acres we sold during in louisiana for million and nearly  acres in wisconsin we sold during for million

no operating income was recognized for the transaction as the book value of the timberlands we disposed of approximated the exchange value of million 
revenues from higher and better use recreational land sales were generally comparable between and the prior year 
however  average sales realization decreased by due primarily to our continued focus on selling lower valued recreational properties 
the demand for higher valued recreational properties remains weak due to concern over near term real estate values  low consumer confidence  and the inability of buyers to secure debt financing 
the timing of real estate sales is a function of many factors  including the general state of the economy  demand in local real estate markets  the ability to obtain entitlements  the ability of buyers to obtain financing  the number of competing properties listed for sale  the seasonal nature of sales particularly in the northern states  the plans of adjacent landowners  our expectation of future price appreciation  the timing of harvesting activities  and the availability of government and not for profit funding especially for conservation sales 
also  in any period the sales average will vary based on the location and physical characteristics of the parcels sold

table of contents part ii item lumber sales prices were higher during due primarily to limited supply  a temporary increase in demand and the closure and curtailment of our mills in  which generally sold a lower value product 
the supply of lumber was constrained due to extensive mill curtailments and weather related log shortages  primarily during the first half of the temporary improvement in demand was primarily due to the restocking of lumber inventories in anticipation of the spring building season
