item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview headquartered in louisville  kentucky  humana is one of the nation s largest publicly traded health and supplemental benefits companies  based on our revenues of approximately billion 
we provide full service benefits and wellness solutions  offering a wide array of health  pharmacy and supplemental benefit products for employer groups  government benefit programs  and individuals  as well as primary and workplace care through our medical centers and worksite medical facilities 
as of december   we had approximately million members in our medical benefit plans  as well as approximately million members in our specialty products 
we manage our business with two segments government and commercial 
the government segment consists of beneficiaries of government benefit programs  and includes three lines of business medicare  military  and medicaid 
the commercial segment consists of members enrolled in our medical and specialty products marketed to employer groups and individuals 
when identifying our segments  we aggregated products with similar economic characteristics 
these characteristics include the nature of customer groups as well as pricing  benefits  and underwriting requirements 
these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer 
the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes 
we allocate all selling  general and administrative expenses  investment and other revenue  interest expense  and goodwill  but no other assets or liabilities  to our segments 
members served by our two segments often utilize the same provider networks  in some instances enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers 
our segments also share indirect overhead costs and assets 
as a result  the profitability of each segment is interdependent 
our results are impacted by many factors  but most notably are influenced by our ability to establish and maintain a competitive and efficient cost structure and to accurately and consistently establish competitive premium  aso fee  and plan benefit levels that are commensurate with our benefit and administrative costs 
benefit costs are subject to a high rate of inflation due to many forces  including new higher priced technologies and medical procedures  new prescription drugs and therapies  an aging population  lifestyle challenges including diet and smoking  the tort liability system  and government regulation 
our industry relies on two key statistics to measure performance 
the benefit ratio  which is computed by taking total benefit expenses as a percentage of premium revenues  represents a statistic used to measure underwriting profitability 
the selling  general  and administrative expense ratio  or sg a expense ratio  which is computed by taking total selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of premium revenues  administrative services fees and other revenues  represents a statistic used to measure administrative spending efficiency 
health insurance reform in march  the president signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of which we collectively refer to as the health insurance reform legislation which enact significant reforms to various aspects of the us health insurance industry 
while regulations and interpretive guidance on some provisions of the health insurance reform legislation have been issued to date by the department of health and human services hhs  the department of labor  the treasury department  and the national association of insurance commissioners  there are many significant provisions of the legislation that will require additional guidance and clarification in the form of regulations and interpretations in order to fully understand the impacts of the legislation on our overall business  which we expect to occur over the next several years 

table of contents implementation dates of the health insurance reform legislation vary from as early as six months from the date of enactment  or september   to as late as the following outlines certain provisions of the health insurance reform legislation changes effective for plan years beginning on or after september  included elimination of pre existing condition limits for enrollees under age  elimination of certain annual and lifetime caps on the dollar value of benefits  expansion of dependent coverage to include adult children until age  a requirement to provide coverage for preventive services without cost to members  new claim appeal requirements  and the establishment of an interim high risk program for those unable to obtain coverage due to a pre existing condition or health status 
effective january   minimum benefit ratios were mandated for all commercial fully insured health plans in the large group  small group  and individual markets  with rebates to policyholders if the actual benefit ratios do not meet these minimums 
medicare advantage payment benchmarks for were frozen at levels and beginning in  additional cuts to medicare advantage plan payments will take effect plans will receive a range of in high cost areas to in low cost areas of medicare fee for service rates  with changes being phased in over two to six years  depending on the level of payment reduction in a county 
in addition  beginning in  the gap in coverage for medicare part d prescription drug coverage will incrementally close 
beginning in  the health insurance reform legislation requires all individual and group health plans to guarantee issuance and renew coverage without pre existing condition exclusions or health status rating adjustments  the elimination of annual limits on coverage on certain plans  the establishment of state based exchanges for individuals and small employers with up to employees  the introduction of standardized plan designs based on set actuarial values  the establishment of a minimum benefit ratio of for medicare advantage plans  and an annual insurance industry premium based assessment billion levied on the insurance industry in with increasing annual amounts thereafter  which is not deductible for income tax purposes 
the health insurance reform legislation also specifies required benefit designs  limits rating and pricing practices  encourages additional competition including potential incentives for new market entrants and expands eligibility for medicaid programs 
in addition  the law will significantly increase federal oversight of health plan premium rates and could adversely affect our ability to appropriately adjust health plan premiums on a timely basis 
financing for these reforms will come  in part  from material additional fees and taxes on us and other health insurers  health plans and individuals beginning in  as well as reductions in certain levels of payments to us and other health plans under medicare as described above 
our results of operations have been affected by the health insurance reform legislation 
during  we recorded a charge of million to write down deferred acquisition costs associated with our guaranteed renewable individual major medical policies since these costs will not be recoverable from our estimates of future cash flows based on an analysis that considered  among others  our current understanding of the pertinent provisions of the health insurance reform legislation  including the minimum benefit ratio requirement 
in addition  our effective tax rate increased due to the limitation of deductible annual compensation over  per employee 
as discussed above  implementing regulations and related interpretive guidance continue to be issued on several significant provisions of the health insurance reform legislation  and it has been challenged in the judicial system 
given the breadth of possible changes and the uncertainties of interpretation  implementation  and timing of these changes  which we expect to occur over the next several years  the health insurance reform legislation could change the way we do business  potentially impacting our pricing  benefit design  product mix  geographic mix  and distribution channels 
the response of other companies to health insurance reform legislation and adjustments to their offerings  if any  could cause meaningful disruption in the local health care 
table of contents markets 
further  various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level 
it is reasonably possible that the health insurance reform legislation and related regulations  as well as future legislative changes  in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  including restricting revenue  enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments  restricting our ability to expand into new markets  increasing our medical and administrative costs  lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with the non deductible federal premium tax and other assessments  our financial position  including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill  and our cash flows 
if the new non deductible federal premium tax is imposed as enacted  and if we are unable to adjust our business model to address this new tax  there can be no assurance that the non deductible federal premium tax would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows 
government segment our strategy and commitment to the medicare programs have led to significant growth 
medicare advantage fully insured membership increased to  members at december   up  members  or  from  members at december   primarily due to sales of group medicare advantage products and preferred provider organization  or ppo  products 
average fully insured medicare advantage membership increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  likewise  medicare advantage premium revenues have increased to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the year ended december  we expect medicare advantage membership to increase by  to  members  or approximately to in beginning in  sponsors of medicare advantage private fee for service  or pffs  plans are required to contract with providers to establish adequate networks  except in geographic areas that cms determines have fewer than two network based medicare advantage plans 
our development of networks in multiple areas of the country over the past few years made it possible for many of our pffs members to transition automatically to our network based products 
on april   cms announced that medicare advantage payment rates would remain flat in based on the information available at the time we filed our bids in june  we believe we effectively designed medicare advantage products that address the flat rates while continuing to remain competitive compared to both the combination of original medicare with a supplement policy as well as other medicare advantage competitors within our industry 
in addition  we will continue to pursue our cost reduction and outcome enhancing strategies  including care coordination and disease management  which we believe will mitigate the adverse effects of the negative rate changes on our medicare advantage members 
nonetheless  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute operational and strategic initiatives with respect to changes in the medicare advantage program 
failure to execute these strategies may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows 
we also offer medicare stand alone prescription drug plans  or pdps  under the medicare part d program 
these plans provide varying degrees of coverage 
our medicare stand alone pdp membership declined to  members at december   down  members  or  from december   resulting primarily from our competitive positioning as we realigned stand alone pdp premium and benefit designs to correspond with our historical prescription drug claims experience 
in october  we announced the lowest premium national stand alone medicare part d prescription drug plan co branded with wal mart stores  inc  the humana walmart preferred rx plan  to be offered for the plan year 
we expect medicare stand alone pdp membership to increase between  and  members  or approximately to in primarily due to increased sales  particularly for the humana walmart preferred rx plan 
our quarterly government segment earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the medicare part d benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership 
the medicare part d benefit design results in 
table of contents coverage that varies as a member s cumulative out of pocket costs pass through successive stages of a member s plan period which begins annually on january for renewals 
these plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages 
as a result  the government segment s benefit ratio generally decreases as the year progresses 
in addition  the number of low income senior members as well as year over year changes in the mix of membership in our stand alone pdp products affect the quarterly benefit ratio pattern 
cms is conducting certain procedural risk adjustment data validation audits  or radv audits  of us and various companies selected medicare advantage contracts to review medical record documentation in an attempt to validate provider coding practices and the presence of risk adjustment conditions which influence the calculation of rates paid to medicare advantage plans 
the radv audits are more fully described under government contracts beginning on page our military services business primarily consists of the tricare south region contract 
for the year ended december   premiums and aso fees associated with the tricare south region contract were  million  or of our total premiums and aso fees 
on march   the tma exercised its options to extend the tricare south region contract for option period vii and option period viii 
the exercise of these option periods extends the tricare south region contract through march  on october   we were notified that the tma intended to negotiate with us for an extension of our administration of the tricare south region contract  and on january   an amendment of solicitation modification of contract to the tricare south region contract  in the form of an undefinitized contract action  became effective 
the amendment adds one additional one year option period  option period ix which runs from april  through march  
on january   the tma notified us of their intent to exercise option period ix 
in july  we were notified by the dod that we were not awarded the third generation tricare program contract for the south region which had been subject to competing bids 
we filed a protest with the gao in connection with the award to another contractor citing discrepancies between the award criteria and procedures prescribed in the request for proposals issued by the dod and those that appear to have been used by the dod in making its contractor selection 
in october  we learned that the gao had upheld our protest  determining that the tma evaluation of our proposal had unreasonably failed to fully recognize and reasonably account for the likely cost savings associated with our record of obtaining network provider discounts from our established network in the south region 
on december   we were advised that tma notified the gao of its intent to implement corrective action consistent with the discussion contained within the gao s decision with respect to our protest 
on october   tma issued its latest amendment to the request for proposal requesting from offerors final proposal revisions to address  among other things  health care cost savings resulting from provider network discounts in the south region 
we submitted our final proposal revisions on november  at this time  we are not able to determine whether or not the protest decision by the gao will have any effect upon the ultimate disposition of the contract award 
we are continuing to evaluate issues associated with our military services businesses such as potential impairment of certain assets primarily consisting of goodwill  which had a carrying value of million at december   potential exit costs  possible asset sales  and a strategic assessment of ancillary businesses 
military services goodwill was not impaired at december  if our current contract is extended through march  and we are not ultimately awarded the new third generation tricare program contract for the south region  we expect that as the march  contract end date nears  future cash flows will not be sufficient to warrant recoverability of all or a portion of the military services goodwill 
in this event  we expect a goodwill impairment would occur during the second half of 
table of contents commercial segment commercial segment pretax earnings decreased million  or  for compared to commercial segment pretax earnings for were negatively impacted by a million write down of deferred acquisition costs associated with our individual major medical policies and a net charge of million due to reserve strengthening for our closed block of long term care policies 
excluding these items  commercial segment pretax earnings improved year over year due to medical trend that was lower than trend assumed in pricing  continued pricing discipline  administrative cost reductions  and prior year favorable reserve releases not in the ordinary course of business 
as a result of significant reforms to the us health insurance industry discussed previously  a substantial portion of deferred acquisition costs associated with our individual major medical block of business were not recoverable from future income and we recorded a charge to selling  general  and administrative expense of million during as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in
