item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements  which are included in this report 
overview we are a maryland corporation primarily focused on investing in  financing and managing residential and commercial mortgage backed securities and mortgage loans 
we are externally managed and advised by invesco advisers  inc our manager  which is an indirect  wholly owned subsidiary of invesco ltd 
we elected to qualify to be taxed as a reit commencing with our taxable year ended december  accordingly  we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes on our taxable income that we distribute currently to our shareholders as long as we maintain our qualification as a reit 
we operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exclusion from the definition of investment company under the investment company act of  as amended the act 
our objective is to provide attractive risk adjusted returns to our shareholders  primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation 
to achieve this objective  we invest in the following agency rmbs  which are residential mortgage backed securities  for which a us government agency such as the government national mortgage association ginnie mae or a federally chartered corporation such as the federal national mortgage association fannie mae or the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac guarantees payments of principal and interest on the securities  non agency rmbs  which are rmbs that are not issued or guaranteed by a us government agency or a federally chartered corporation  cmbs  which are commercial mortgage backed securities  and residential and commercial mortgage loans 
we finance our investments in agency rmbs  non agency rmbs and cmbs through short term borrowings structured as repurchase agreements 
in addition  we historically financed our investments in cmbs with borrowings under the us government s talf program 
in november  the company exercised its right to prepay the talf loans secured by cmbs 
the purpose for the prepayment was to obtain lower borrowing costs from other sources 
we have also financed our investments in certain non agency rmbs  cmbs and residential and commercial mortgage loans by contributing capital to one or more of the legacy securities ppifs that receive financing under the us government s pipp  established and managed by our manager or one of its affiliates  which  in turn  invests in our target assets 
public offerings on january   the company completed a follow on public offering of  shares of common stock and an issuance of an additional  shares of common stock pursuant to the underwriters full exercise of their over allotment option at per share 
net proceeds to the company were million  net of issuance costs of approximately million 
on may   the company completed an additional follow on public offering of  shares of common stock at per share

on june   the underwriters purchased an additional  shares of common stock at per share pursuant to an over allotment option 
the net proceeds to the company were million  net of issuance costs of approximately on october   the company completed a public offering of  shares of common stock and an issuance of an additional  shares of common stock pursuant to the underwriters full exercise of their over allotment option at per share 
net proceeds to the company were approximately million  net of issuance costs of approximately million 
on december   the company completed a public offering of  shares of common stock and an issuance of an additional  shares of common stock pursuant to the underwriters full exercise of their over allotment option at per share 
net proceeds to the company were approximately million  net of issuance costs of approximately million 
factors impacting our operating results our operating results can be affected by a number of factors and primarily depend on  among other things  the level of our net interest income  the market value of our assets and the supply of  and demand for  the target assets in which we invest 
our net interest income  which includes the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of purchase discounts  varies primarily as a result of changes in market interest rates and prepayment speeds  as measured by the constant prepayment rate cpr on our target assets 
interest rates and prepayment speeds vary according to the type of investment  conditions in the financial markets  competition and other factors  none of which can be predicted with any certainty 
market conditions beginning in the summer of  significant adverse changes in financial market conditions resulted in a deleveraging of the entire global financial system 
as part of this process  residential and commercial mortgage markets in the united states experienced a variety of difficulties  including loan defaults  credit losses and reduced liquidity 
as a result  many lenders tightened their lending standards  reduced lending capacity  liquidated significant portfolios or exited the market altogether  and therefore  financing with attractive terms was generally unavailable 
in response to these unprecedented events  the us government has taken a number of actions to stabilize the financial markets and encourage lending 
significant measures include the enactment of the emergency economic stabilization act of to  among other things  establish the troubled asset relief program  tarp  the enactment of the hera  which established a new regulator for fannie mae and freddie mac and the establishment of the talf and the ppip 
some of these programs are beginning to expire and the impact of the wind down of these programs on the financial sector and on the economic recovery is unknown 
we have elected to participate in programs established by the us government  including the talf and the ppip  in order to increase our ability to acquire our target assets and to provide a source of financing for such acquisitions 
the talf was intended to make credit available to consumers and businesses on more favorable terms by facilitating the issuance of asset backed securities and improving the market conditions for asset backed securities generally 
the federal reserve bank of new york  frbny  made up to billion of loans under the talf 
the facility ceased making loans collateralized by newly issued and legacy abs on march  as a result  we are no longer able to obtain additional talf loans as a source of financing for investments in legacy cmbs 
in november  the company exercised its right to prepay the talf loans secured by cmbs 
the purpose for the prepayment was to obtain lower borrowing costs from other sources 
the ppip is designed to encourage the transfer of certain illiquid legacy real estate related assets off of the balance sheets of financial institutions  restarting the market for these assets and supporting the flow of credit and other capital into the broader economy 
as of march   the invesco ppip fund stopped accepting investment subscriptions and the fund was deemed closed 
the dodd frank act enacted on july   contains numerous provisions affecting the financial and mortgage industries  many of which may have an impact on our operating environment and the target assets in which we invest 
consequently  the dodd frank act may affect our cost of doing business  may limit our investment opportunities and may affect the competitive balance within our industry and market areas 
investment activities as of december   of our equity was invested in agency rmbs  in non agency rmbs  in cmbs  and in the invesco ppip fund 
we use leverage on our target assets to achieve our return objectives 
for our total investment portfolio  we focus on securities we believe provide attractive returns when levered approximately to times 
the leverage may periodically exceed the stated ranges as we adjust our borrowings to obtain the best available source and minimize total interest expense  while maintaining our overall portfolio leverage guidelines 
as of december   we had approximately billion million in year fixed rate securities that offered higher coupons and call protection based on the collateral attributes 
we balanced this with approximately billion million in year fixed rate  approximately million million in hybrid adjustable rate mortgages arms and approximately million million in arms we believe to have similar durations based on prepayment speeds 
as of december   we had purchased approximately million million non agency rmbs 
initially  we focused on cmbs that could be financed under the talf 
in november  the company exercised its right to prepay the talf loans secured by cmbs 
the purpose for the prepayment was to obtain lower borrowing costs 
the company obtained additional advances under existing repurchase agreement financing arrangements 
as of december   we owned approximately million million in cmbs and financed million in repurchase agreements compared to million financed under talf at december  in addition  as of december   we had purchased approximately million million in cmos

we enter into repurchase agreements to finance the majority of our agency rmbs  non agency rmbs and cmbs 
these agreements are secured by a portion of our agency rmbs  non agency rmbs and cmbs and bear interest at rates that have historically moved in close relationship to the london interbank offer rate libor 
as of december   we had entered into repurchase agreements totaling billion million 
we committed to invest up to million million in the invesco ppip fund  which  in turn  invests in our target assets 
as of december   approximately million million of our commitment to the invesco ppip fund has been called 
hedging instruments 
we generally hedge as much of our interest rate risk as we deem prudent in light of market conditions 
no assurance can be given that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
our investment policies do not contain specific requirements as to the percentages or amount of interest rate risk that we are required to hedge 
interest rate hedging may fail to protect or could adversely affect us because  among other things available interest rate hedging may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which protection is sought  the duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related liability  the party owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay  the credit quality of the party owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction  and the value of derivatives used for hedging may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with accounting rules to reflect changes in fair value 
downward adjustments or mark to market losses would reduce our shareholders equity 
as of december   we had entered into interest rate swap agreements designed to mitigate the effects of increases in interest rates under a portion of our repurchase agreements 
these swap agreements provide for fixed interest rates indexed off of one month libor and effectively fix the floating interest rates on approximately billion of borrowings under our repurchase agreements as of december  we intend to continue to add interest rate hedge positions according to our hedging strategy

our maximum exposure is the unpaid principal balance of the underlying rmbs that exceeds the specified loss limit 
we will also be required to post cash collateral to secure potential loss payments 
book value per share our book value was and as of december  and december   respectively  on a fully diluted basis  after giving effect to our units of limited partnership interest in our operating partnership  which may be converted to common shares at the sole election of the company 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap  which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties 
our most critical accounting policies involve decisions and assessments that could affect our reported assets and liabilities  as well as our reported revenues and expenses 
we believe that all of the decisions and assessments upon which our consolidated financial statements are based are reasonable at the time made and based upon information available to us at that time 
we rely upon independent pricing of our assets at each quarter s end to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates of fair market value 
for a discussion of our critical accounting policies  see notes to consolidated financial s tatements in the financial statements accompanying this report 
results of operations the table below presents certain information from our consolidated statement of operations for the years ending december   december  and for the period from june  date of inception to december  in thousands  except per share data year ended december  year ended december  period from june  date of inception to december  revenues interest income interest expense net interest income other income loss gain on sale of investments equity in earnings and fair value change in unconsolidated limited partnerships loss on other than temporarily impaired securities unrealized loss on interest rate swaps gain on credit default swap total other income expenses management fee related party general and administrative insurance professional fees total expenses net income loss net income loss attributable to non controlling interest net income attributable to common shareholders nm earnings per share net income attributable to common shareholders basic diluted nm dividends declared per common share weighted average number of shares of common stock basic nm diluted nm nm not meaningful net income summary for the year ended december   our net income was million million  or basic and diluted net income per average share available to common shareholders 
the increase to net income is primarily attributable to the growth in our investment portfolio resulting from our follow on public offerings in january  may  october and december which in the aggregate raised approximately million net of issuance costs and a full year of income earned on our investment portfolio in versus approximately six months of operations in interest income and average earning asset yield our primary source of income is interest earned on our investment portfolio 
for the year ended december   we had average earning assets of approximately billion million and earned interest income of million million 
the yield on our average investment portfolio was 
the change in our average assets and the portfolio yield was primarily the result of the increase in our investment portfolio after our january  may  october and december follow on common stock offerings which in the aggregate raised approximately million net of issuance costs and a full year of income earned on our investment portfolio 
the cpr of our portfolio impacts the amount of premium and discount on the purchase of securities that is recognized into income 
our agency and non agency rmbs had a weighted average cpr of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the table below shows the three month cpr for our rmbs compared to bonds with similar characteristics cohorts december  december  company cohort company cohort year agency rmbs year agency rmbs agency hybrid arm rmbs n a n a non agency rmbs n a n a overall n a n a on february   fannie mae and freddie mac announced their intention to purchase delinquent loans from certain mortgage pools guaranteed by them 
for purposes of these purchases  delinquent loans are those that are days or greater delinquent as of the measurement date 
the impact of the increased buy outs accelerated the amortization of premium paid for these agency rmbs  which reduces interest income 
in the fourth quarter of  the company correctly anticipated the increased buy outs and sold several agency rmbs that were at risk 
for the year ended december   the company estimates the increased buy outs reduced interest income by million as a result of higher premium amortization 
for the quarter ended december   the buy outs had no significant impact on interest income 
for the agency rmbs held in the portfolio as of december   the company estimates that the completion of this buy out program will have no significant effect on future periods 
interest expense and the cost of funds our largest expense is the interest expense on borrowed funds 
for the year ended december   we had average borrowed funds of approximately billion million and total interest expense of million million 
the increase in average borrowed funds and interest expense was primarily the result of increasing our investment portfolio leverage in connection with our january  may  october and december follow on public offerings which in the aggregate raised approximately million net of issuance costs and borrowing outstanding for a full year 
for the year ended december   our average cost of funds was 
since a substantial portion of our repurchase agreements are short term  changes in market rates are directly reflected in our interest expense 
interest expense includes borrowing costs under repurchase agreements  the talf borrowings  as well as costs for our interest rate hedges 
net interest income our net interest income  which equals interest income less interest expense  totaled million million for the year ended december  our net interest rate margin  which equals the yield on our average assets for the period less the average cost of funds for the period  was for the year ended december  the increase in net interest income was primarily the result of increasing our investment portfolio with the proceeds of our january  may  october and december follow on public offerings which raised approximately million net of issuance costs and a full year of our leveraged income earning portfolio 
gain on sale of investments as part of our ongoing credit evaluation process  all of our mbs are reviewed on a monthly basis to determine if they continue to meet our risk and return targets 
this process involves looking at changing market assumptions and the impact those assumptions will have on the individual securities 
as a result of our change in market assumptions  we sold securities and recognized a net gain of approximately million million for the year ended december  loss on other than temporary impaired securities for the year ended december   we recognized losses of approximately  on other than temporarily impaired securities in the consolidated statement of operations which had been included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
credit losses on non agency rmbs were anticipated and included in the price paid for the asset at acquisition and are included in the security s estimated yield at acquisition 
equity in earnings and change in fair value of unconsolidated limited partnerships for the year ended december   we recognized equity in earnings and unrealized appreciation on the change in fair value of our investment in the invesco ppip fund of approximately million  and million  respectively 
the increase in equity in earnings and unrealized income on the change in fair value was primarily the result of an increase in the fair value of the invesco ppip fund 
other income loss our other income loss relates to the unrealized loss on interest rate swaps of approximately  which represents the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of our interest rate swaps which is recognized directly in earnings for the year ended december  in addition  our other income loss includes revenue of  from a credit default swap contract entered into in december expenses for the year ended december   we incurred management fees of million million  which are payable to our manager under our management agreement 
the increase in management fees is primarily the result of increasing our investment portfolio with the proceeds of our january  may  october and december follow on public offerings which in the aggregate raised approximately million net of issuance costs 
see certain relationships  related transactions  and director independence for a discussion of the management fee and our relationship with our manager 
for the year ended december   our general and administrative expense of approximately million  includes the salary and the estimated bonus of our chief financial officer and our controller  amortization of equity based compensation related to anticipated quarterly grants of our stock to our independent directors  payable subsequent to each calendar quarter  cash based payments to our independent directors  derivative transaction fees  filing fees and other miscellaneous general and administrative costs 
the increase in general and administrative expense is attributed primarily to an increase in filing fees  derivative transaction fees and salaries and bonuses during for the year ended december   our insurance expense of approximately million  represents the cost of liability insurance to indemnify our directors and officers 
the increase in insurance expense is attributed to a full year of insurance premium costs expensed during versus insurance expenses for only approximately six months of operations in for the year ended december   our professional fees of million  represents the cost of legal  accounting  auditing and consulting services provided to us by third party service providers 
the increase in professional fees is primarily attributed to costs associated with an increase in the complexity of our financial reporting and a full year of operations in net income and return on average equity for the year ended december   our net income was million million and our annualized return on average equity was 
the change in net income and return on average equity was primarily the result of increasing our investment portfolio through the investment of the proceeds of our january  may  october and december  follow on offerings which in the aggregate raised approximately million net of issuance costs in our target assets and a full year of operations 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to pay dividends  fund investments  repayment of borrowings and other general business needs 
our primary sources of funds for liquidity consists of the net proceeds from our common equity offerings  net cash provided by operating activities  cash from repurchase agreements and other financing arrangements and future issuances of equity and or debt securities 
we also have sought  and may continue to finance our assets under  and may otherwise participate in  programs established by the us government 
we currently believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources available for the acquisition of additional investments  repayments on borrowings and the payment of cash dividends as required for continued qualification as a reit 
we generally maintain liquidity to pay down borrowings under repurchase arrangements to reduce borrowing costs and otherwise efficiently manage our long term investment capital 
because the level of these borrowings can be adjusted on a daily basis  the level of cash and cash equivalents carried on our balance sheet is significantly less important than our potential liquidity available under borrowing arrangements 
we allocate our equity to each of our target assets and apply leverage to obtain our net interest income 
we invest in assets that provide attractive returns with an aggregate debt to equity ratio of to times 
the table below shows the allocation of our equity and debt to equity ratio as of december  the leverage on each class of assets may periodically exceed the stated ranges as we adjust our borrowings to obtain the best available source and minimize total interest expense while maintaining our overall portfolio leverage guidelines

across our repurchase facilities for agency rmbs  the haircuts range from a low of to a high of  for non agency rmbs range from a low of to a high of  and for cmbs range from a low of and 
our hedged cost of funds was approximately and as of december  and december   respectively 
declines in the value of our securities portfolio can trigger margin calls by our lenders under our repurchase agreements 
an event of default or termination event would give some of our counterparties the option to terminate all repurchase transactions existing with us and require any amount due by us to the counterparties to be payable immediately 
as discussed above under market conditions  the residential mortgage market in the united states has experienced difficult economic conditions including increased volatility of many financial assets  including agency securities and other high quality rmbs assets  due to potential security liquidations  increased volatility and deterioration in the broader residential mortgage and rmbs markets  and significant disruption in financing of rmbs 
if these conditions persist  then our lenders may be forced to exit the repurchase market  become insolvent or further tighten lending standards or increase the amount of required equity capital or haircut  any of which could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain financing 
effective as of august   we implemented a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan  pursuant to which we registered and reserved for issuance  shares of our common stock 
under the terms of the plan  shareholders who participate in the plan may purchase shares of our common stock directly from us  in cash investments up to  at our sole discretion  we may accept optional cash investments in excess of  per month  which may qualify for a discount from the market price of to 
plan participants may also automatically reinvest all or a portion of their dividends for additional shares of our stock 
we expect to use the proceeds from any dividend reinvestments or stock purchases for general corporate purposes 
during the year ended december   we issued a total of common shares pursuant to the plan 
effects of margin requirements  leverage and credit spreads our securities have values that fluctuate according to market conditions and  as discussed above  the market value of our securities will decrease as prevailing interest rates or credit spreads increase 
when the value of the securities pledged to secure a repurchase loan decreases to the point where the positive difference between the collateral value and the loan amount is less than the haircut  our lenders may issue a margin call  which means that the lender will require us to pay the margin call in cash or pledge additional collateral to meet that margin call 
under our repurchase facilities  our lenders have full discretion to determine the value of the securities we pledge to them 
most of our lenders will value securities based on recent trades in the market 
lenders also issue margin calls as the published curren t principal balance factors change on the pool of mortgages underlying the securities pledged as collateral when scheduled and unscheduled paydowns are announced monthly 
we experience margin calls in the ordinary course of our business 
in seeking to effectively manage the margin requirements established by our lenders  we maintain a position of cash and unpledged securities 
we refer to this position as our liquidity 
the level of liquidity we have available to meet margin calls is directly affected by our leverage levels  our haircuts and the price changes on our securities 
if interest rates increase as a result of a yield curve shift or for another reason or if credit spreads widen  then the prices of our collateral and our unpledged assets that constitute our liquidity will decline  we will experience margin calls  and we will use our liquidity to meet the margin calls 
there can be no assurance that we will maintain sufficient levels of liquidity to meet any margin calls 
if our haircuts increase  our liquidity will proportionately decrease 
in addition  if we increase our borrowings  our liquidity will decrease by the amount of additional haircut on the increased level of indebtedness 
we intend to maintain a level of liquidity in relation to our assets that enables us to meet reasonably anticipated margin calls but that also allows us to be substantially invested in securities 
we may misjudge the appropriate amount of our liquidity by maintaining excessive liquidity  which would lower our investment returns  or by maintaining insufficient liquidity  which would force us to liquidate assets into unfavorable market conditions and harm our results of operations and financial condition 
forward looking statements regarding liquidity based upon our current portfolio  leverage rate and available borrowing arrangements  we believe that the net proceeds of our common equity offerings and private placements  combined with cash flow from operations and available borrowing capacity  will be sufficient to enable us to meet anticipated short term one year or less liquidity requirements to fund our investment activities  pay fees under our management agreement  fund our distributions to shareholders and for other general corporate expenses 
our ability to meet our long term greater than one year liquidity and capital resource requirements will be subject to obtaining additional debt financing and equity capital 
we may increase our capital resources by obtaining long term credit facilities or through public or private offerings of equity or debt securities  possibly including classes of preferred stock  common stock  and senior or subordinated notes 
such financing will depend on market conditions for capital raises and our ability to invest such offering proceeds 
if we are unable to renew  replace or expand our sources of financing on substantially similar terms  it may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
contractual obligations on july   we entered into an agreement with our manager pursuant to which our manager is entitled to receive a management fee and the reimbursement of certain expenses 
the management fee will be calculated and payable quarterly in arrears in an amount equal to of our shareholders equity  per annum  calculated and payable quarterly in arrears 
our manager uses the proceeds from its management fee in part to pay compensation to its officers and personnel who  notwithstanding that certain of those individuals are also our officers  receive no cash compensation directly from us 
we are required to reimburse our manager for operating expenses related to us incurred by our manager  including certain salary expenses and other expenses relating to legal  accounting  due diligence and other services 
expense reimburse ments to our manager are made in cash on a monthly basis following the end of each month 
our reimbursement obligation is not subject to any dollar limitation 
contractual commitments as of december   we had the following contractual commitments and commercial obligations payments due by period total less than year years years after years in thousands repurchase agreements invesco ppip fund investment total contractual obligations as of december   we had approximately million in contractual interest payments related to our repurchase agreements 
off balance sheet arrangements we committed to invest up to million in the invesco ppip fund  which  in turn  invests in our target assets 
as of december   approximately million million of the commitment has been called 
the company also utilizes credit derivatives  such as credit default swaps cds  to provide credit event protection based on a financial index or specific security in exchange for receiving a fixed rate fee or premium over the term of the contract 
these instruments enable the company to synthetically assume the credit risk of a reference security  portfolio of securities or index of securities 
the counterparty pays a premium to the company and the company agrees to make a payment to compensate the counterparty for losses upon the occurrence of a specified credit event 
although contract specific  credit events generally include bankruptcy  failure to pay  restructuring  obligation acceleration  obligation default  or repudiation moratorium 
upon the occurrence of a defined credit event  the difference between the value of the reference obligation and the cds s notional amount is recorded as realized loss in the statement of operations 
our only cds contract was entered into on december  with a million notional balance where the company sold protection on a specific pool of non agency rmbs that exceed a specified loss limit of for a stated fix rate fee of 
the company s maximum exposure is the unpaid principal balance of the underlying rmbs that exceeds the specified loss limit 
the company is required to post cash collateral to secure potential loss payments 
shareholders equity on january   we completed a follow on public offering of  shares of common stock and an issuance of an additional  shares of common stock pursuant to the underwriters full exercise of their over allotment option at per share 
the net proceeds to us were million  net of issuance costs of approximately million 
on may   we completed an additional follow on public offering of  shares of common stock at per share 
the net proceeds to us were million  net of issuance costs of approximately million 
on june   the underwriters purchased an additional  shares of common stock at per share pursuant to an over allotment option 
the net proceeds to us were approximately million  net of issuance costs of approximately  on october   the company completed a public offering of  shares of common stock and an issuance of an additional  shares of common stock pursuant to the underwriters full exercise of their over allotment option at per share 
net proceeds to the company were approximately million  net of issuance costs of approximately million 
on december   the company completed a public offering of  shares of common stock and an issuance of an additional  shares of common stock pursuant to the underwriters full exercise of their over allotment option at per share 
net proceeds to the company were approximately million  net of issuance costs of approximately million 
unrealized gains and losses since we account for our investment securities as available for sale  unrealized fluctuations in market values of assets do not impact our us gaap income but rather are reflected on our balance sheet by changing the carrying value of the asset and shareholders equity under accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
in addition  unrealized fluctuations in market values of our cash flow hedges that qualify for hedge accounting are also reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
for the year ended december   net unrealized gain and losses included in shareholders equity is million million 
as a result of this mark to market accounting treatment  our book value and book value per share are likely to fluctuate far more than if we used historical amortized cost accounting 
as a result  comparisons with companies that use historical cost accounting for some or all of their balance sheet may not be meaningful 
share based compensation we established the equity incentive plan for grants of restricted common stock and other equity based awards to our independent  non executive directors  and to the officers and employees of the manager the incentive plan 
under the incentive plan  a total of  shares are currently reserved for issuance 
unless terminated earlier  the incentive plan will terminate in  but will continue to govern the unexpired awards 
our three independent  non executive directors are each eligible to receive  in restricted common stock annually 
for the year ended december   we recognized compensation expense of approximately   and issued  shares shares of restricted stock to our independent  non executive directors pursuant to the incentive plan 
the n umber of shares issued was determined based on the closing price on the nyse on the actual date of grant 
dividends we intend to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common stock 
us federal income tax law generally requires that a reit distribute annually at least of its reit taxable income  determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains  and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than of its taxable income 
we intend to pay regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders in an amount equal at least of our net taxable income 
before we pay any dividend  whether for us federal income tax purposes or otherwise  we must first meet both our operating requirements and debt service on our repurchase agreements and other debt payable 
if our cash available for distribution is less than our net taxable income  we could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to make cash distributions  or we may make a portion of the required distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities 
inflation virtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature 
as a result  interest rates and other factors influence our performance far more than inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
other matters we calculate that at least of our assets were qualified reit assets  as defined in the internal revenue code of  as amended the code for the period ended december  we also calculate that our revenue qualifies for the source of income test and for the source of income test rules for the period ended december  consequently  we met the reit income and asset test as of december  we also met all reit requirements regarding the ownership of our common stock and the distribution of our net income as of december  therefore  as of december   we believe that we qualified as a reit under the code 
we at all times intend to conduct our business so that neither we nor our operating partnership nor the subsidiaries of our operating partnership are required to register as an investment company under the act 
if we were to become required to register as an investment company  then our use of leverage would be substantially reduced 
because we are a holding company that conducts our business through our operating partnership and the operating partnerships wholly owned or majority owned subsidiaries  the securities issued by these subsidiaries that are excepted from the definition of investment company under section c or section c of the act  together with any other investment securities the operating partnership may own  may not have a combined value in excess of of the value of the operating p artnership s total assets exclusive of us government securities and cash items on an unconsolidated basis  which we refer to as the test 
this requirement limits the types of businesses in which we may engage through our subsidiaries 
in addition  we believe neither the company nor the operating partnership are considered an investment company under section a a of the act because they do not engage primarily or hold themselves out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing  reinvesting or trading in securities 
rather  through the operating partnership s wholly owned or majority owned subsidiaries  the company and the operating partnership are primarily engaged in the non investment company businesses of these subsidiaries 
ias asset i llc and certain of the operating partnership s other subsidiaries that we may form in the future rely upon the exclusion from the definition of investment company under the act provided by section c c of the act  which is available for entities primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate 
this exclusion generally requires that at least of each subsidiary s portfolio be comprised of qualifying assets and at least be comprised of qualifying assets and real estate related assets and no more than comprised of miscellaneous assets 
qualifying assets for this purpose include mortgage loans fully secured by real estate and other assets  such as whole pool agency and non agency rmbs  that the sec or its staff in various no action letters has determined are the functional equivalent of mortgage loans fully secured by real estate 
we treat as real estate related assets cmbs  debt and equity securities of companies primarily engaged in real estate businesses  agency partial pool certificates and securities issued by pass through entities of which substantially all of the assets consist of qual ifying assets and or real estate related assets 
additionally  unless certain mortgage securities represent all the certificates issued with respect to an underlying pool of mortgages  the mbs may be treated as securities separate from the underlying mortgage loans and  thus  may not be considered qualifying interests for purposes of the requirement 
we calculate that as of december   we conducted our business so as not to be regulated as an investment company under the act 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary components of our market risk are related to interest rate  prepayment and market value 
while we do not seek to avoid risk completely  we believe the risk can be quantified from historical experience and we seek to actively manage that risk  to earn sufficient compensation to justify taking those risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we undertake 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental  monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations  and other factors beyond our control 
we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our investments and our repurchase agreements 
our repurchase agreements are typically of limited duration and will be periodically refinanced at current market rates 
we mitigate this risk through utilization of derivative contracts  primarily interest rate swap agreements  interest rate caps and interest rate floors 
interest rate effect on net interest income our operating results depend in large part upon differences between the yields earned on our investments and our cost of borrowing and interest rate hedging activities 
most of our repurchase agreements provide financing based on a floating rate of interest calculated on a fixed spread over libor 
the fixed spread will vary depending on the type of underlying asset which collateralizes the financing 
accordingly  the portion of our portfolio which consists of floating interest rate assets are match funded utilizing our expected sources of short term financing  while our fixed interest rate assets are not match funded 
during periods of rising interest rates  the borrowing costs associated with our investments tend to increase while the income earned on our fixed interest rate investments may remain substantially unchanged 
this increa se in borrowing costs results in the narrowing of the net interest spread between the related assets and borrowings and may even result in losses 
further  during this portion of the interest rate and credit cycles  defaults could increase and result in credit losses to us  which could adversely affect our liquidity and operating results 
such delinquencies or defaults could also have an adverse effect on the spread between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
hedging techniques are partly based on assumed levels of prepayments of our rmbs 
if prepayments are slower or faster than assumed  the life of the rmbs will be longer or shorter  which would reduce the effectiveness of any hedging strategies we may use and may cause losses on such transactions 
hedging strategies involving the use of derivative securities are highly complex and may produce volatile returns 
interest rate effects on fair value another component of interest rate risk is the effect that changes in interest rates will have on the market value of the assets that we acquire 
we face the risk that the market value of our assets will increase or decrease at different rates than those of our liabilities  including our hedging instruments 
we primarily assess our interest rate risk by estimating the duration of our assets and the duration of our liabilities 
duration measures the market price volatility of financial instruments as interest rates change 
we generally calculate duration using various financial models and empirical data 
different models and methodologies can produce different duration numbers for the same securities 
the impact of changing interest rates on fair value can change significantly when interest rates change materially 
therefore  the volatility in the fair value of our assets could increase significantly in the event interest rates change materially 
in addition  other factors impact the fair value of our interest rate sensitive investments and hedging instruments  such as the shape of the yield curve  market expectations as to future interest rate changes and other market conditions 
accordingly  changes in actual interest rates may have a material adverse effect on us 
prepayment risk as we receive prepayments of principal on our investments  premiums paid on these investments are amortized against interest income 
in general  an increase in prepayment rates will accelerate the amortization of purchase premiums  thereby reducing the interest income earned on the investments 
conversely  discounts on such investments are accreted into interest income 
in general  an increase in prepayment rates will accelerate the accretion of purchase discounts  thereby increasing the interest income earned on the investments 
extension risk we compute the projected weighted average life of our investments based upon assumptions regarding the rate at which the borrowers will prepay the underlying mortgages 
in general  when a fixed rate or hybrid adjustable rate security is acquired with borrowings  we may  but are not required to  enter into an interest rate swap agreement or other hedging instrument that effectively fixes our borrowing costs for a period close to the anticipated average life of the fixed rate portion of the related assets 
this strategy is designed to protect us from rising interest rates  because the borrowing costs are fixed for the duration of the fixed rate portion of the related target asset 
however  if prepayment rates decrease in a rising interest rate environment  then the life of the fixed rate portion of the related assets could extend beyond the term of the swap agreement or other hedging instrument 
this could have a negative impact on our results from operations  as borrowing costs would no longer be fixed after the end of the hedging instrument  while the income earned on the hybrid adjustable rate assets would remain fixed 
this situation may also cause the market value of our hybrid adjustable rate assets to decline  with little or no offsetting gain from the related hedging transactions 
in extreme situations  we may be forced to sell assets to maintain adequate liquidity  which could cause us to incur losses 
market risk market value risk our available for sale securities are reflected at their estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income 
the estimated fair value of these securities fluctuates primarily due to changes in interest rates and other factors 
generally  in a rising interest rate environment  the estimated fair value of these securities would be expected to decrease  conversely  in a decreasing interest rate environment  the estimated fair value of these securities would be expected to increase 
the sensitivity analysis table presented below shows the estimated impact of an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve  up and down and basis points  on the market value of our interest rate sensitive investments and net interest income  at december   assuming a static portfolio 
when evaluating the impact of changes in interest rates  prepayment assumptions and principal reinvestment rates are adjusted based on our manager s expectations 
the analysis presented utilized assumptions  models and estimates of our manager based on our manager s judgment and experience 
change in interest rates percentage change in projected net interest income percentage change in projected portfolio value real estate risk residential and commercial property values are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors  including  but not limited to national  regional and local economic conditions which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors  local real estate conditions such as the supply of housing stock  changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments  construction quality  age and design  demographic factors  and retroactive changes to building or similar codes 
in addition  decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral and the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay our loans  which could also cause us to suffer losses 
credit risk we believe that our investment strategy will generally keep our credit losses and financing costs low 
however  we retain the risk of potential credit losses on all of the residential and commercial mortgage loans  as well as the loans underlying the non agency rmbs and cmbs in our portfolio 
we seek to manage this risk through our pre acquisition due diligence process and through the use of non recourse financing  which limits our exposure to credit losses to the specific pool of mortgages that are subject to the non recourse financing 
in addition  with respect to any particular asset  our manager s investment team evaluates  among other things  relative valuation  supply and demand trends  shape of yield curves  prepayment rates  delinquency and default rates  recovery of various sectors and vintage of collateral 
risk management to the extent consistent with maintaining our reit qualification  we seek to manage risk exposure to protect our investment portfolio against the effects of major interest rate changes 
we generally seek to manage this risk by monitoring and adjusting  if necessary  the reset index and interest rate related to our target assets and our financings  attempting to structure our financing agreements to have a range of different maturities  terms  amortizations and interest rate adjustment periods  using hedging instruments  primarily interest rate swap agreements but also financial futures  options  interest rate cap agreements  floors and forward sales to adjust the interest rate sensitivity of our target assets and our borrowings  and actively managing  on an aggregate basis  the interest rate indices  interest rate adjustment periods  and gross reset margins of our target assets and the interest rate indices and adjustment periods of our financings
