item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive overview the company s business consists of three manufacturing facilities and one r d center 
these facilities primarily manufacture pharmaceutical intermediates  apis and ingredients derived from organic chemistry 
the company also owns a stake in zenara pharma zenara  a hyderabad  india based pharmaceutical company with final dosage form manufacturing capabilities  and iep gmbh iep  a german based business that designs and licenses biocatalytic enzymes 
the following significant events  which are explained in detail on the following pages  occurred during the company acquired a equity stake in zenara for approximately  in november zenara is a pharmaceutical company focused on the formulation of final dosage form products 
cambrex accounts for its investment in zenara using the equity method of accounting 
in march  the company completed the acquisition of iep  a leader in the field of industrial biocatalysis 
iep offers cost effective customized biocatalytic process development and sales of enzymes to the pharmaceutical industry and was acquired for approximately  in cash 
during  the company finalized a plan to restructure its operations at a manufacturing site which resulted in a reduction in workforce of employees 
the plan included certain one time benefits for terminated employees  all of which will be paid in cash 
costs related to this transaction are recorded on the company s income statement under the caption restructuring expenses and totaled  in sales in decreased to  from  in the impact from foreign currency exchange was negligible 
the main drivers of the lower sales include declines in products utilizing the company s drug delivery technology due to a negotiated contract extension resulting in lower volumes and pricing  two apis manufactured under long term supply agreements  one of which is a result of a supply chain disruption at a customer s facility that has since been resolved and the other due to lower demand by a customer  and lower custom development revenue 
sales of a feed additive were also lower as a result of exiting the product line 
the company experienced higher generic api sales due to higher volumes partially offset by competitive pricing 
sales of controlled substances  which the company defines as drugs falling under schedule ii of the us drug enforcement agency s classification system  showed continued growth in gross margins in decreased slightly to from in excluding a unfavorable impact from foreign currency  gross margins increased to in versus excluding the foreign currency impact  the higher margins are due primarily to favorable product mix  lower production costs  insurance proceeds related to a business interruption claim and fees related to the cancellation of a supply contract partially offset by lower pricing during one customer  gyma  a distributor representing multiple customers  accounted for of the company s sales 
the company recorded tax expense of  in compared to  in the tax provisions in and were affected by the non recognition of tax benefits in the us where losses are incurred and the company records valuation allowances against the benefits 
the tax provision also includes a charge of approximately  for an estimate of an international tax liability related to a transaction

index critical accounting policies the company s critical accounting policies are those that require the most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management under each applicable circumstance 
actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the differences could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
a discussion of the company s critical accounting policies  the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting their application and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or us ing different assumptions  is as follows revenue recognition revenues are generally recognized when title to products and risk of loss are transferred to customers 
additional conditions for recognition of revenue are that collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and the company has no further performance obligations 
the company has certain contracts that contain multiple deliverables 
these deliverables often include process development services and commercial production and are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  and delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in the control of the company 
the consideration the company receives is allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables on the basis of their relative selling price the relative selling price method 
when applying the relative selling price method  the selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price  if it exists  otherwise  third party evidence tpe of selling price is used 
if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a deliverable  the company uses it best estimate of selling price for that deliverable 
once the accounting units are defined  applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
the above policy is in accordance with the emerging issues task force guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the company elected to early adopt the provisions of this standard  on a prospective basis  for revenue arrangements entered into our materially modified beginning january  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
for contracts that contain milestone based payments  the company recognizes revenue using the proportional performance method based on the percentage of costs incurred relative to the total costs estimated to be incurred to complete the contract 
revenue recognition computed under this methodology is compared to the amount of non refundable cash payments received or contractually receivable at the reporting date and the lesser of the two amounts is recognized as revenue at each reporting date 
the proportional performance methodology applied by the company for revenue recognition utilizes an input based measure  specifically labor costs  because the company believes the use of an input measure is a better surrogate of proportional performance than an output based me asure  such as milestones 
amounts billed in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet 
since payments received are typically non refundable  the termination of a contract by a customer prior to its completion could result in an immediate recognition of deferred revenue relating to payments already received but not previously recognized as revenue 
sales terms to certain customers include rebates if certain conditions are met 
additionally  sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions 
the company estimates these rebates and returns at the time of sale based on the terms of agreements with customers and historical experience and recognizes revenue net of these estimated costs which are classified as allowances and rebates 
the company bills a portion of freight cost incurred on shipments to customers 
amounts billed to customers are recorded within net revenues 
freight costs are reflected in cost of goods sold

index asset valuations and review for potential impairments the review of long lived assets  principally fixed assets and other amortizable intangibles  requires the company to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows generated from these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
if undiscounted cash flows are less than carrying value  the long lived assets are written down to fair value 
the review of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles is conducted annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable utilizing a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of the reporting units is determined using a discounted cash flow model and compared to the carrying value 
if such analysis indicates that impairment may exist  the company then estimates the fair value of the other assets and liabilities utilizing appraisals and discounted cash flow analyses to calculate an impairment charge 
the determination of fair value is judgmental and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including projected future cash flows primarily based on operating plans  discount rates  determination of appropriate market comparables and perpetual growth rates 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge 
environmental and litigation contingencies the company periodically assesses the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against it 
see note for a discussion of the company s current environmental and litigation matters  reserves recorded and its position with respect to any related uncertainties 
while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions  the company uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that the company will incur an expense related to a settlement for such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss  if any  can be made 
if probable and estimable  the company accrues for the costs of clean up  settlements and legal fees 
given the inherent uncertainty relat ed to the eventual outcome of litigation and environmental matters  it is possible that all or some of these matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions that the company may have made with respect to their resolution 
income taxes the company applies an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s assessment that it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated in the relevant tax jurisdictions to utilize the deferred tax assets 
in the event the company determines that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance is recorded 
the company s valuation allowances primarily relate to foreign tax credits  alternative minimum tax credits  and other net deferred balances in the us  where profitability is uncertain  and nol carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions with little or no history of generating taxable income or where future profitability is uncertain 
employee benefit plans the company provides a range of benefits to certain employees and retired employees  including pensions  post employment benefits and health care benefits 
the company records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations  which include various actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  assumed rates of return  turnover rates  and health care cost trend rates 
the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so 
the effect of the modifications is generally recorded and amortized over future periods 
the company believes that the assumptions utilized for recording obligations under its plans are re asonable 
the discount rate used to measure pension liabilities and costs is selected by projecting cash flows associated with plan obligations which are matched to a yield curve of high quality bonds 
the company then selects the single rate that produces the same present value as if each cash flow were discounted by the corresponding spot rate on the yield curve

the company will continue to record a full valuation allowance  primarily on its domestic net deferred tax assets and indefinite lived intangibles  until an appropriate level of domestic profitability is sustained or tax strategies can be developed that would enable the company to conclude that it is more likely than not that a portion of the domestic net deferred tax assets would be realized 
if the company continues to report pre tax losses in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions  income tax benefits associated with those losses will not be recognized and  therefore  those losses would not be reduced by such income tax benefits

index market risks currency risk management the company primary market risk relates to exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on transactions entered into by international operations which are primarily denominated in the us dollar  euro and swedish krona 
the company currently uses foreign currency exchange forward contracts to mitigate the effect of short term foreign exchange rate movements on the company local operating results 
as a matter of policy  the company does not hedge to protect the translated results of foreign operations 
the notional amount of these contracts as of december  was  unrealized foreign exchange contract losses do not subject the company actual results to risk as gains or losses on these contracts are undertaken to offset ga ins or losses on the transactions that are hedged 
the foreign exchange contracts have varying maturities with none exceeding twelve months 
with respect to the contracts outstanding at december   a fluctuation of the local currency over a one year period would cause  pre tax earnings to be at risk 
this is based on the notional amount of the contracts  adjusted for unrealized gains and losses  of  these calculations do not include the impact of exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would offset the gains and losses of the derivative instruments 
interest rate management the company previously employed a plan to mitigate interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap agreements to convert floating rates to fixed interest rates 
during  the company had three interest rate swaps in place with an aggregate notional value of  at an average fixed rate of 
these interest rate swaps matured in october interest expense related to these swaps totaled  for the year ended december  at december   the company did not have any interest rate swaps outstanding

the company continually assesses all known facts and circumstances as they pertain to all legal and environmental matters and evaluates the need for reserves and disclosures as deemed necessary based on these facts and circumstances 
these matters  either individually or in the aggregate  could have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition  operating results and cash flows in a future reporting period 
environmental in connection with laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment  the company and its subsidiaries are a party to several environmental proceedings and remediation investigations and cleanups and  along with other companies  have been named a prp for certain waste disposal sites superfund sites 
additionally  the company has retained the liability for certain environmental proceedings associated with discontinued operations 
it is the company s policy to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters where remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
such liabilities are based on the company s best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work 
each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties  and it is possible that some of these matters will be decided unfavorably against the company 
the resolution of such matters often spans several years and frequently involves regulatory oversight or adjudication 
additionally  many remediation requirements are not fixed and are likely to be affected by future technological  site  and regulatory developments 
consequently  the ultimate liability with respect to such matters  as well as the timing of cash disbursements cannot be determined with certainty
