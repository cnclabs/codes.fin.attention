to operate a chain of retail stores selling party goods 
on august   iparty retail acquired inventory  fixed assets and the leases of retail stores from the big party corporation the big party  a privately held company  which was operating under bankruptcy protection  in exchange for cash and the assumption of certain liabilities 
we have subsequently opened an additional nineteen stores  acquired three stores  and closed three stores

the rights will become exercisable only in the event that  with certain exceptions  an acquiring party accumulates percent or more of our voting stock or if a party announces an offer to acquire percent or more of our voting stock 
when exercisable  each right entitles the holder to purchase from us one one hundredth of a share of a new series of series g junior preferred stock at an initial purchase price of  subject to adjustment 
in addition  upon the occurrence of certain events  holders of the rights would be entitled to purchase either iparty corp 
stock or shares in an acquiring entity as defined in the rights plan at half of market value 
our rights plan  in addition to our capital structure  may have the effect of delaying  deferring  or preventing a change of control  and could discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock 
the holders of our convertible preferred stock have a liquidation preference senior to the holders of our common stock 
in the event of liquidation  which is defined in our restated certificate of incorporation to include a merger  acquisition  or a similar transaction involving the acquisition of our company  our convertible preferred stockholders would be entitled to a liquidation value  which was  at december  this amount is in excess of the carrying value of the convertible preferred stock due to amounts allocated to warrants  which were issued in connection with the original issuances of our convertible preferred stock 
the difference of approximately million will be accreted when and if a liquidation event occurs

competition the party supplies retailing business is highly competitive and fragmented 
we compete with a variety of smaller and larger retailers  including single owner operated party supply stores  specialty party supplies retailers  discount department stores  retail drug store chains  general mass merchants and supermarkets  as well as catalog  internet merchants and temporary seasonal stores  especially halloween stores 
our success depends in part on our ability to be competitive against many different competitors in each local market area we serve 
if we fail to anticipate evolving innovations and product offerings from our competitors and fail to offer products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various markets we serve  demand for our products could decline and our operating results would be adversely affected 
while the competitive importance of product quality  price  service and innovation varies from product to product  price is a factor  and we experience pricing pressures from competitors in our markets 
barriers to entry are minimal 
new competitors can open new or temporary stores and launch new catalogs and internet sites at a relatively low cost 
however  we believe that the costs to remain competitive over the longer term in the party supplies retailing business can be significant 
these costs include the hiring of human resources with industry knowledge and the marketing costs associated with building a widely recognized brand 
seasonality our business has a seasonal pattern 
in the past three years  we have realized an average of approximately of our annual revenues in our fourth quarter  which includes halloween and christmas  and an average of approximately of our annual revenues in the second quarter  which includes school graduations  and often the easter holiday 
also  during these past three years  we have had net income in our second and fourth quarters and generated losses in our first and third quarters 
suppliers and inventory the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of third party vendors 
many of the products that we offer for sale  such as paper based party goods  halloween masks and costumes  are manufactured overseas in foreign countries such as china 
global sourcing of many of the products we sell is thus an important factor in our financial performance 
the following represents suppliers from whom we purchased at least of our merchandise in either or supplier products supplied amscan  inc paper party goods kendall confectionery company candy hallmark marketing corp 
paper party goods total in august  we entered into a supply agreement with amscan  inc amscan which extended to and obligated us to purchase increased levels of merchandise from amscan  our largest supplier  in exchange for  among other things  the right to receive more favorable pricing terms over the life of the agreement than were generally available to us under our previous terms with amscan 
on december   we extended the supply agreement with amscan until december  from the original expiration date of december  the loss of any of these suppliers could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
we consider numerous factors in supplier selection  including  but not limited to  price  credit terms  product offerings and quality 
as is customary in our industry  we generally do not have long term contracts with our suppliers  other than our supply agreement  and any supplier may discontinue selling to us at any time 
intellectual property we hold trademarks for iparty issued by the us patent and trademark office 
trademark registrations for iparty were issued on february  and august  under us registration no

until august  we licensed the use of the website to a third party for the purpose of internet based product sales 
we received no significant revenue under this arrangement during our fiscal years  and the license was cancelled by iparty in august  employees as of december   we had full time employees and part time employees 
none of these employees is represented by a labor union  and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good

risk factors investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk 
in addition to the other information contained in this report  you should consider the following risk factors before investing in our securities 
our success depends on economic and other external factors  particularly in the new england region and during the halloween season  that affect consumer decisions about whether and when to purchase party goods and supplies 
our business success depends in large measure on consumer decisions to buy party goods and supplies and seek party planning advice  particularly in the new england region  where of our stores are located  as of december   and particularly during the halloween season  which is our single most important season 
demand for our products and our business results are sensitive to external factors that  directly or indirectly  affect consumer confidence  consumer spending patterns  levels of disposable consumer income  or otherwise lead consumers to host or not host parties or purchase party goods and supplies 
examples of such external factors include unseasonable weather  especially in new england  the timing  duration and effects of adverse changes in overall economic conditions  including rates of job loss or growth  fuel and energy prices  and increases or decreases in interest rates  nationally or more locally in the markets we serve  and the competitive success or failure of local sports teams  such as the new england patriots or boston red sox  particularly in post season play 
the precise impact of any of these external factors on consumer spending patterns for party goods and supplies is difficult to predict in advance  but one or more of these factors could adversely affect our business or our operating results  particularly with respect to any given fiscal period  to the extent they adversely impact the consumer spending patterns most important to our business success 
recessions and economic downtowns may lead to a loss in consumer confidence and decline and change in consumer spending that may continue beyond any recovery period 
the recent recession experienced by the us economy has contributed to a loss in consumer confidence and a decline in consumer spending that has had and may continue to have an impact on our business  which represents discretionary spending 
because purchases of our merchandise are dependent upon discretionary spending by our customers  our financial performance is sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that affect consumer spending 
consumer spending habits are affected by  among other things  prevailing economic conditions  levels of employment  salaries and wage rates  changes in commodity prices  including gas and food prices  consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions 
the united states has recently experienced a severe recession  which led to a decline in consumer spending 
although there is consensus among economists that the economy is in recovery  the strength and duration of a recovery is unpredictable 
a renewed economic downturn could further reduce consumer spending or cause a shift in consumer discretionary spending to other products  adversely affecting our liquidity and results of operations 
our failure to generate sufficient cash to meet our liquidity needs may affect our ability to service our indebtedness and grow our business 
our business requires access to capital to support growth  improve our infrastructure  respond to economic conditions  and meet our contractual commitments 
our bank line of credit with wells fargo bank  national association successor by merger to wells fargo retail finance  llc wells fargo allows us to borrow up to  subject to a limitation based on qualified inventory  receivables levels and other reserves set by wells fargo  with an option to increase that limit up to million prior to july as of december   there was  outstanding under our line of credit with additional availability of  which we believe to be sufficient to fund our operations  working capital requirements  and capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
in the event that our current operating plan or long term goals change due to changes in our strategic plans  lower than expected revenues  unanticipated expenses  increased competition  unfavorable economic conditions  other risk factors discussed in this annual report  or other unforeseen circumstances  our liquidity may be negatively impacted 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness  principally the amounts borrowed under our bank line of credit  and to fund any capital expenditures for systems upgrades  new store openings  if any  and updating existing stores  we may make in the future will depend in large part on our current and future ability to generate cash 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive and other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future  that our currently anticipated growth in revenues and cash flow will be realized on schedule  or that future borrowings will be available to us under our line of credit in an amount sufficient to enable us to undertake store openings  update existing stores and replace and upgrade our technology systems to grow our business  or to fund other liquidity needs 
if we need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness from other sources  we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so on terms and conditions acceptable to us 
our business may be adversely affected by the actions of and risks associated with our third party vendors 
the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of third party vendors 
we cannot control the supply  design  function or cost of most of the products that we offer for sale and are dependent on the availability and pricing of various products  including  without limitation  paper based party goods  halloween masks  and costumes  many of which are manufactured overseas in foreign countries such as china 
global sourcing of many of the products we sell is thus an important factor in our financial performance 
our ability to find qualified vendors and access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge  especially with respect to goods sourced outside the united states 
disruptions in the availability of raw materials used in production of these products may adversely affect our sales and result in customer dissatisfaction 
political instability  the financial instability of suppliers  merchandise quality issues  trade restrictions  tariffs  currency exchange rates  transport capacity and costs  inflation and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control 
these and other issues directly or indirectly affecting our vendors could adversely affect our business and financial performance 
in addition  if our overall performance deteriorates  or if we experience liquidity challenges  our third party suppliers and vendors may demand accelerated payment of amounts due to them or require advance payments or letters of credit before goods are shipped to us 
these demands could have a significant adverse impact on our operating cash flow and on our liquidity 
our third party suppliers and vendors have also experienced the impact of the recent recession 
if one or more of our third party suppliers fails or is unable to supply us with adequate goods  due to their own financial troubles or the financial troubles of their suppliers  including factories in china  we may experience an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our business may be adversely affected by increases in commodity prices  especially oil and gas prices  which affect the pricing and supply of our products 
volatile oil and gasoline prices impact prices of petroleum based plastic products  which are a key raw material in much of our merchandise  affect our freight costs  and affect consumer confidence and spending patterns 
additionally  we have seen shortages in helium supplies affecting the pricing of certain popular products  such as balloons 
inflation in china  where many of our products are sourced  may also be leading to increased prices from our suppliers for our products 
if we are unable to pass along to our customers any increases in prices from our suppliers  our results of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected 
we face intense competition from many sources 
the industry we serve is highly competitive and fragmented 
we face intense competition from other party supply stores and stores that merchandise and market party supplies  including big discount retailers  such as wal mart  retail drug store chains  like cvs and walgreens  dollar store chains  party goods catalogs and internet sites and temporary halloween stores 
our success thus depends on our ability to be competitive against many different competitors in each local market area we serve 
if we fail to anticipate evolving innovations and product offerings from our competitors and fail to offer products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various markets we serve  demand for our products could decline and our operating results would be adversely affected 
while the competitive importance of product quality  price  service and innovation varies from product to product  price is a factor  and we experience pricing pressures from competitors in our markets 
in  we opened four temporary halloween stores in our home new england market  in  we increased the number of temporary halloween stores to eleven  also in our home new england market 
we intend to expand our temporary halloween stores in future years  opening more such stores  some of which may be outside of new england 
in doing so  we will face intense competition from other operators of temporary halloween stores  such as spirit halloween  halloween usa and others  including party goods internet sites 
if we fail to secure a sufficient number of appropriate temporary retail locations  or if sales achieved at those locations fall below planned levels  our operating results would be adversely affected 
we face new competitive threats as a result of consolidation in our industry following amscan holdings  inc s acquisitions of party city corporation  party america and factory card and party outlet 
amscan holdings  inc ahi  the parent company of amscan  inc 
amscan our largest supplier and the largest supplier in our industry  or ahi s parent  aah holdings corporation aah  owns party city corporation  party america and factory card party outlet corp 
factory card 
through the acquisitions of these party goods companies  ahi and aah own a total of approximately corporate and franchise party supply stores nationwide 
none of these companies currently has a significant presence in the new england region 
we have a supply agreement with amscan which extends through and obligates us to purchase minimum levels of merchandise from amscan 
in addition to the supply agreement with amscan  we have a non competition agreement from party city and its affiliates that covers massachusetts  maine  new hampshire  vermont  rhode island  windsor and new london counties and a part of hartford county in connecticut  which extends through any further geographic expansion by us outside of the new england market could result in greater direct competition with one or all of party city  party america and factory card 
if so  aah and ahi s acquisitions of party city  party america and factory card  and its status as our largest supplier and the largest supplier in our industry could adversely affect our ability to compete favorably or operate successfully in a changed marketplace 
price pressures from such new sources of competition  particularly in the event of a strain or rupture in our relationship with amscan  could erode our margins and cause our financial results of operations to suffer 
our success depends on our ability to evaluate and respond to the threats arising from growing consolidation and changing marketplaces and identify ways in which we can competitively operate and strategically grow our store base 
a major failure of our information systems would harm our business 
the failure of any of our systems  including  without limitation  our point of sale system and our existing merchandise management system  the latter of which was developed by a vendor who is no longer in business and is thus currently unsupported by a third party  would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results of operations 
we depend on these information systems to operate our retail stores  process transactions  respond to customer inquiries  manage inventory  purchase and sell goods on a timely basis  and maintain cost efficient operations 
we may experience operational problems with our information systems as a result of system failures or any inability on our part to find and retain qualified personnel to monitor  maintain  and upgrade these systems  particularly with respect to our merchandise management system  or other causes 
we cannot assure you that our systems will be adequate to support future growth  either as currently configured or as we plan to possibly update them 
any material disruption or slowdown of our systems would severely interfere with the normal operation of our retail store operations and could have a materially negative impact on our business operations and financial results 
in particular  our total borrowing base under our line of credit depends  among other things  on our inventory levels  credit card receivables  customer deposits  and merchandise credits 
accordingly  any material disruption or problem affecting our point of sale or merchandise management systems could materially and adversely affect our borrowing level  our financial statements  our compliance with various covenants under our bank agreement  and our liquidity and cash resources 
our quarterly operating results are subject to significant fluctuation 
our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past  and we expect that they will continue to do so in the future 
factors that could cause these quarterly fluctuations  both sequentially and on a year over year basis  include the following extreme weather related disruptions  particularly in new england  the timing of movable holidays  such as easter  which typically falls in the second quarter but on occasion falls in the first quarter  the competitive success or failure of local sports teams  such as the new england patriots or boston red sox  particularly in post season play  which may result in fluctuations from one year to the next in our sales in the first and fourth quarters  the extent to which sales in new stores result in the loss of sales in existing stores  the mix of products sold  the sales results from period to period of merchandise categories with highly volatile demand levels such as silly bandz and webkinz  pricing and marketing actions of competitors  the level of advertising and promotional expenses  and seasonality  primarily because the sales and profitability of our stores are typically lower in the first and third quarters  when we have often operated at a loss  and are typically higher in the second quarter  which includes school graduations  and the fourth quarter  which includes halloween  our single most important selling season  as well as the christmas holiday season 
most of our operating expenses  such as rent expense  advertising expense and employee salaries  do not vary directly with the amount of sales and are difficult to adjust in the short term 
as a result  if sales in a particular quarter are below expectations for that quarter  we may not be able to proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter  and such a sales shortfall could have a disproportionate effect on our net income or loss for the quarter 
our failure to attract  retain  and motivate qualified personnel would adversely affect our business 
our success depends in large part on the efforts and abilities of our senior management team 
their skills  experience and industry contacts significantly benefit our operations and administration 
the failure to attract  retain  and properly motivate the members of our senior management team and other key employees  or to find suitable replacements for them in the event of death  ill health  or their desire to pursue other professional opportunities  could have a negative effect on our operating results 
our performance is also largely dependent on attracting and retaining quality associates that are able to make the consumer shopping experience at our stores a fun and informative experience 
we face intense competition for qualified associates  and many of our associates are in entry level or part time positions with historically high rates of turnover 
our ability to generally meet our labor needs while controlling our labor costs is subject to numerous external factors  including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force  unemployment levels  prevailing wage rates  changing demographics  health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation  particularly in the new england region 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified associates or our labor costs increase significantly  our business and financial performance may be adversely affected 
risks associated with recent and possible future new store openings could adversely affect our business 
an important part of our long range business plan is to increase our number of stores  including temporary stores  and  over time  enter new geographic markets 
we have opened new stores  acquired three stores  closed three stores and operated temporary halloween stores over the past six years  bringing our total number of stores from at the beginning of to at the end of going forward into  in addition to managing our expenses  we intend to grow through opening or acquiring new retail locations  continuing the implementation of our temporary halloween store strategy  through sales growth in our existing retail stores  and by re entering the e commerce business 
for a growth strategy to be successful  we must identify and lease or acquire favorable store sites  hire and train associates and store managers  and adapt management and operational systems to meet the needs of our expanded operations 
these tasks may be difficult to accomplish successfully 
if we are unable to open or acquire new or temporary stores in locations and on terms acceptable to us as quickly as planned  our future sales and profits may be adversely affected 
even if we succeed in opening or acquiring new stores or opening temporary stores  these stores may not achieve the same sales or profit levels as our existing stores 
also  our expansion strategy includes opening new or temporary stores in markets where we already have a presence so we can take advantage of economies of scale in marketing  distribution and supervision costs 
however  these new or temporary stores may result in the loss of sales in existing stores in nearby areas  which could adversely affect our business and financial performance 
in addition  future store openings could cause us  among other things  to incur additional debt and increased interest expense  as well as experience dilution in earnings  if any  per share 
if we are not able to service or access this additional debt for future store openings or raise additional equity  which may be difficult or costly given our stock price and the anti dilution provisions of our convertible preferred stock  our growth strategy may be impaired  adversely affecting our results of operations and liquidity 
impairment losses could also occur as a result of new store openings in the event that new store openings prove unsuccessful 
our ownership structure includes large investors who own preferred stock and whose interests and rights in our company may differ in important respects from those of our common stock investors 
as of december   there were  shares of common stock outstanding  and  potential additional common share equivalents outstanding that may be issued upon the conversion of outstanding convertible preferred stock  warrants and options to purchase our common stock 
the average weekly trading volumes in our common stock as reported on the nyse amex for the fifty two week periods ended december   december  and december  were  shares   shares and  shares  respectively 
additionally  a number of investors in our company own large concentrations of our common and convertible preferred stock making our shares more illiquid than if our ownership structure were more widely distributed 
the ownership rights of these holders of our convertible preferred stock impact the trading liquidity of our common shares  our corporate governance  and the relative economic stake that our common stock and convertible preferred stock investors have in the enterprise value of our business 
although a more active trading market may develop in the future  the limited market liquidity for our stock may affect your ability to sell at a price that is satisfactory to you 
our corporate governance is affected by our ownership structure to the extent that certain of our convertible preferred stock investors currently enjoy  among other things  contractual rights to nominate and elect two of the members of our board of directors  although neither of these board seats is currently filled 
these rights and the concentration of share ownership enjoyed by certain of our convertible preferred stock investors mean that our largest investors can influence our strategic direction and that of our senior management in ways that are different from most of our common stock investors 
our convertible preferred stock investors also enjoy certain economic rights that differentiate their ownership rights and interests from those of our common stock investors 
for instance  upon the occurrence of a merger  acquisition or a similar transaction involving the acquisition of our company  the holders of our convertible preferred stock would generally be entitled to a liquidation preference that would entitle them  collectively  to the first million of net proceeds  unless they decide to convert their shares of convertible preferred stock into common stock 
this feature of our convertible preferred stock investors rights could make the attractiveness of our company as an acquisition target differ materially from what it would be without it 
in addition  our convertible preferred stock investors enjoy certain anti dilution protections not afforded to our common stock investors  which generally means that investors in shares of our common stock could be adversely affected by subsequent dilutive financings  if any  in ways that are different from some or all of our convertible preferred stock investors 
shares that may be resold pursuant to our prospectus on form s or eligible for sale in the future could negatively affect our stock price 
certain securities may be sold in the future pursuant to registration statements filed with the sec or without registration under the securities act  to the extent permitted by rule or other exemptions under the securities act 
we may issue additional shares in the future in connection with acquisitions  compensation or otherwise  although we cannot ensure that we will be able to identify or complete any acquisition in the future  whether stock based or otherwise 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock or the perception that these sales could occur 
this may also make it more difficult for us to raise funds through the issuance of debt or the sale of equity securities 
as of december   there were  potential additional common share equivalents outstanding 
these included  shares issuable upon the conversion of immediately convertible preferred stock   shares issuable upon the exercise of a warrant with an exercise price of   shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants with a weighted average price of  and  shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options with a weighted average exercise price of 
our common stock is thinly traded  may fluctuate based on relatively small levels of trading activity  and may be adversely affected by our capital structure  which makes it more difficult for investors to value our business 
investing in shares of our common stock entails a high degree of risk 
public trading of our common stock on the nyse amex formerly known as the american stock exchange typically occurs at relatively low sales volumes and very few  if any  security analysts regularly follow our stock 
moreover  our common stock price has traded below for significant periods of time 
in addition  our capital structure  which includes various series of convertible preferred stock with various contractual rights  generally makes it more difficult for investors  or prospective acquirers of our company  to value our business on an aggregate basis or to value our shares of common stock on a trading basis 
as a result of these factors  speculative investors may have a greater effect on our common stock price than would be the case for a company with a simpler ownership structure  a larger market capitalization  or common shares that are more diffusely held or heavily traded 
accordingly  our common stock price could be subject to considerable speculative volatility and may not necessarily follow market expectations regarding our business prospects or financial performance 
in particular  our common stock price may be sensitive to non financial developments involving our company as well as market rumors disseminated on the internet or other forms of media regarding our company or our industry 
if our quarterly financial performance does not meet the expectations of investors that trade in shares of our common stock  our stock price would likely decline 
if so  the decrease in the stock price may be disproportionate to the shortfall  real or perceived  in our financial performance 
compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance  public disclosure  and accounting standards may result in additional expenses and risks 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance  public disclosure and changes to accounting standards and practices  including the sarbanes oxley act of  the dodd frank act of  new sec regulations  corporate law developments in delaware  and evolving rules applicable to publicly traded companies on the nyse amex are creating uncertainty  and hence risks  for companies such as ours 
these new or changed laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations due to the fact that they are new and there has not yet emerged a well developed body of interpretation 
as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies 
this development could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure  governance and accounting practices 
our efforts to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
in particular  we have applied significant management and financial resources to document  test  monitor and enhance our internal controls over financial reporting in order to meet the various current requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of as a smaller reporting company  we are not required to subject our internal controls to audit by our independent registered public accounting firm and only management is required to certify as to the effectiveness of our internal controls 
if we were to become subject to an audit  there can be no assurance that such an audit of our internal controls would not result in the identification of a material weakness 
additionally  any failure in the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting could have a material effect on our financial reporting or cause us to fail to meet reporting obligations  which upon disclosure  could negatively impact the market price of our common stock 
our efforts to comply with these types of new regulatory requirements regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors audit of our financial statements have required the commitment of increasing levels of financial and managerial resources 
if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws  regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies  we could face various material and adverse consequences  including a decline in our common stock price or a possible delisting of our common stock 
our stock is listed on the nyse amex and subject to a number of continued listing requirements  the failure to comply with which may result in the delisting of our common stock 
our common stock is currently listed on the nyse amex 
subject to nyse amex rules  we are required to maintain compliance with a number of continued listing standards  including but not limited to  the requirement that our stock trade above certain pricing levels for a continued period 
our common stock price has traded below for significant periods of time 
if the exchange considers our common stock to be a low priced stock  our common stock could be subject to delisting 
a delisting of our common stock could negatively impact us by reducing further the liquidity and market price of our common stock  or by reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock  which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity capital 
product liability may adversely impact our operations and merchandise offerings 
we and our vendors are subject to regulations by a variety of state and federal regulatory authorities  including the consumer product safety commission 
if one or more of our vendors fails to adhere to product safety requirements  our reputation and brands could be damaged and we could be subject to product liability suits and government fines and penalties  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
furthermore  to the extent we are unable to replace any non compliant products  we may have to reduce our merchandise offerings  resulting in a decrease in sales 
a privacy breach could adversely affect our business 
the protection of customer  employee  and company data is critical to us 
the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding  with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements 
in addition  customers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information 
a significant breach of customer  employee  or company data could damage our reputation and result in lost sales  fines  or lawsuits  which may adversely affect our results of operations  liquidity and business 
future changes in financial accounting standards may adversely affect our reported results of operations 
a change in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported financial results 
new accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future 
these new accounting pronouncements may adversely affect our reported financial results
