item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in item of this report  which include additional information about our accounting policies  practices and the transactions underlying our financial results 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits  taxes  environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business 
we apply our best judgment  our knowledge of existing fa cts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience  as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances  such as current economic conditions  and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change 
as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision  actual results may differ from these estimates 
ball corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as ball corporation  ball  the company or we or our in the following discussion and analysis 
overview business overview ball corporation is one of the world s leading suppliers of metal packaging to the beverage  food and household products industries 
our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses and are manufactured in plants around the world 
we also provide aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers 
we sell our packaging products primarily to major beverage  food and household products companies with which we have developed long term customer relationships 
this is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of long term supply contracts 
while we have a diversified customer base  we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in north america  europe  the people s republic of china prc  brazil and argentina  as do our equity joint ventures in the us and the prc 
we also purchase raw materials from relatively few suppliers 
because of our customer and supplier concentration  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss  insolvency or bankruptcy of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a majo r customer or supplier  although our contracts and long term relationships generally mitigate the risk of customer loss 
we are also subject to exposure from inflation and the rising costs of raw materials  as well as other inputs into our direct costs 
we reduce our risk to these exposures either by fixing our material costs through derivative contracts or by including provisions in our sales contracts to recover the increases from our customers 
industry trends and corporate strategy in the rigid packaging industry  sales and earnings can be improved by reducing costs  increasing prices  developing new products  expanding volumes and making strategic acquisitions 
over the past two years  we have closed a number of packaging facilities in support of our ongoing objective of matching our supply with market demand 
we have also identified and implemented plans to improve our return on invested capital through the redeployment of assets within our operations 
to better realign capacity  we announced in the closure of our richmond  british columbia  plant and decided not to place into operations a plant in lublin  poland 
in january  we also announced that we will close our torrance  california  plant and relocate a line from the torrance plant to our whitby  ontario  plant 
as part of our packaging strategy  we are focused on developing and marketing new and existing products that meet the needs of our customers and the ultimate consumer 
these innovations include new shapes  sizes  opening features and other functional benefits 
this ongoing packaging development activity helps us maintain and expand our supply positions with major beverage  food and household products customers 
page of while the north american metal beverage container manufacturing industry is relatively mature  the metal beverage container markets in other parts of the world are growing and are expected to continue to grow in the medium to long term 
we have been able to capitalize on growth by adding a plant  as well as additional capacity  in our consolidated brazilian joint venture and by increasing capacity in some of our european metal beverage container manufacturing facilities by speeding up certain lines and by expansion 
in october  we announced that we are expanding production of our lightweight alumi tek bottle in our golden  colorado  facility  and in january  we announced that we will commence specialty can production in our fort worth  t exas  plant 
in february we announced plans to construct a new metal beverage container manufacturing plant in northeast brazil  which is one of the fastest growing regions of the country 
the new plant will be located in alagoinhas and is expected to start up in early the output from the first line has been contracted under a long term agreement 
in july  we entered the aluminum slug market by acquiring a leading north american manufacturer of aluminum slugs used to make extruded aerosol cans  beverage bottles  aluminum collapsible tubes and technical impact extrusions 
to further capitalize on this new product line  in january  we completed the acquisition of a leading european supplier of aluminum aerosol cans and bottles and the aluminum slugs used to make them 
ball s consolidated earnings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and we attempt to mitigate this exposure through the use of derivative financial instruments  as discussed in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk within item a of this report 
the primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace and technologies segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors 
federal budget reductions and priorities  or changes in agency budgets  could limit future funding and new contract awards or delay or prolong contract performance 
we recognize sales under long term contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment using the cost to cost  percentage of completion method of accounting 
the contract mix consisted of approximately two thirds cost type contracts  which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon and or earned profit component  and approximately percent fixed price contracts 
the remainder represents time and material contracts  which typically provide for the sale of engineering labor at fixed hourly rates 
the backlog at december   of million consists of approximately percent fixed price contracts  indicating a trend towards more fixed price business 
throughout the period of contract performance  we regularly reevaluate and  if necessary  revise our estimates of ball aerospace technologies corp 
s total contract revenue  total contract cost and progress toward completion 
because of contract payment schedules  limitations on funding and other contract terms  our sales and accounts receivable for this segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed 
management performance measures management uses various measures to evaluate company performance such as earnings before interest and taxes ebit  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  diluted earnings per share  cash flow from operating activities  free cash flow generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property  plant and equipment  and economic value added net operating earnings after tax  as defined by the company  less a capital charge on net operating assets employed 
these financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods such as business consolidation costs and gains or losses on acquisitions and dispositions 
nonfinancial measures in the packaging businesses include production efficiency and spoilage rates  quality control figur es  environmental  health and safety statistics  production and sales volumes  asset utilization rates  and measures of sustainability 
additional measures used to evaluate financial performance in the aerospace and technologies segment include contract revenue realization  award and incentive fees realized  proposal win rates and backlog including awarded  contracted and funded backlog 
we recognize that attracting  developing and retaining highly talented employees are essential to the success of ball and  because of that  we strive to pay employees competitively and encourage their ownership of the company s common stock as part of a diversified portfolio 
for most management employees  a meaningful portion of compensation is at risk as an incentive  dependent upon economic value added operating performance 
for more senior positions  more compensation is at risk through economic value added performance and various long term cash and stock compensation plans 
through our employee stock purchase plan and k plan  which matches employee contributions with ball common stock  employees  regardless of organizational level  have opportunities to own ball stock

you are advised  however  to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our k  q and k reports to the sec

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments and risk management in the ordinary course of business  we employ established risk management policies and procedures  which seek to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices  interest rates  foreign currencies and prices of the company s common stock in respect of common share repurchases  although there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful 
although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit  market and interest risk  the counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements 
the company monitors counterparty credit risk  including that of its lenders  on a regular basis  but we cannot be certain that all risks will be discerned or that our risk management policies and procedures will always be effective 
we have estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis 
market risk exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative instruments  financial instruments and commodity positions 
to test the sensitivity of our market risk exposure  we have estimated the changes in fair value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical percent adverse change in market prices or rates 
the results of the sensitivity analyses are summarized below 
commodity price risk we manage our commodity price risk in the americas in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum ingot primarily by entering into container sales contracts that include aluminum ingot based pricing terms that generally reflect price fluctuations under our commercial supply contracts for aluminum purchases 
the terms include fixed  floating or pass through aluminum ingot component pricing 
this matched pricing affects most of our aluminum packaging related net sales in the americas 
we also  at times  use certain derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as cash flow hedges of commodity price risk where there is not a pass through arrangement in the sales contract to match underlying purchase volumes and pricing with sales volumes and pricing 
in europe and the prc  the company manages the aluminum and steel raw material commodity price risks through annual and long term contracts for the purchase of the materials  as well as certain sales contracts that reduce the company s exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices within the current year 
these contracts include fixed price  floating and or pass through pricing arrangements 
we also use forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges to manage future aluminum price risk and foreign exchange exposures to match underlying purchase volumes and pricing with sales volumes and pricing for those sales contracts where there is not a pass through arrangement to minimize the company s exposure to significant price changes 
most metal food and household products packaging  americas  steel packaging related sales contracts either include provisions permitting us to pass through some or all steel cost changes we incur  or they incorporate annually negotiated steel costs 
in and in  we were able to pass through to our customers the majority of the steel cost increases 
we anticipate at this time that we will be able to pass through the majority of the steel price increases that may occur in considering the effects of derivative instruments  the company s ability to pass through certain raw material costs through contractual provisions  the market s ability to accept price increases and the company s commodity price exposures under its contract terms  a hypothetical percent adverse change in the company s steel and aluminum prices could result in an estimated million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period 
additionally  the company has foreign currency exposures on raw materials  and the effect of a percent adverse change is included in the total foreign currency exposure discussed below 
actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 
the company is also exposed to fluctuations in prices for natural gas and electricity  as well as the cost of diesel fuel as a component of freight cost 
a hypothetical percent increase in our natural gas and electricity prices could result in an estimated million after tax reduction of net earnings over a one year period 
a hypothetical percent increase in diesel fuel prices could result in an estimated million after tax reduction of net earnings over the same period 
actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 
page of interest rate risk our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to minimize the impact of such changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we may use a variety of interest rate swaps  collars and options to manage our mix of floating and fixed rate debt 
interest rate instruments held by the company at december   included pay fixed interest rate swaps  which effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixed rate instruments 
based on our interest rate exposure at december   assumed floating rate debt levels throughout the next months and the effects of derivative instruments  a basis point increase in interest rates could result in an estimated million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period 
actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these changes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to protect foreign cash flows and earnings from changes associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes through the use of various derivative contracts 
in addition  at times we manage foreign earnings translation volatility through the use of various foreign currency option strategies  and the change in the fair value of those options is recorded in the company s earnings 
our foreign currency translation risk results from the euro  british pound  canadian dollar  polish zloty  chinese renminbi  hong kong dollar  brazilian real  argentine peso  serbian dinar and czech koruna 
we face currency exposures in our global operations as a result of purchasing raw materials in us dollars and  to a lesser extent  in other currencies 
sales contracts ar e negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and  where there is not a foreign exchange pass through arrangement  the company uses forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exposures 
we additionally use various option strategies to manage the earnings translation of the company s european operations into us dollars 
considering the company s derivative financial instruments outstanding at december   and the currency exposures  a hypothetical percent reduction us dollar strengthening in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar could result in an estimated million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period 
this hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would also reduce our forecasted average debt balance by million 
actual changes in market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes 
equity price risk the company s deferred compensation stock program is subject to variable accounting and  accordingly  is marked to market using the company s closing stock price at the end of a reporting period 
based on current share levels in the program  each change in the company s stock price has an effect of million on pretax earnings
