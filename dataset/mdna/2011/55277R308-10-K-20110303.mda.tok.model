item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth above under the caption risk factors 
you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements for the year ended december  and the related notes appearing in part ii item of this report 
overview we are a medical device company focused on the design and development of a non invasive  point of care instrument to aid in the detection of early melanoma 
our principal product  melafind  features a hand held imaging device that emits multiple wavelengths of light to capture images of suspicious pigmented skin lesions and extract data 
we currently do not have any commercialized products or any source of revenue 
all of our historical revenues have come from activities and products that have since been discontinued 
unless otherwise indicated  the following discussion relates to our continuing operations 
the melafind pre market approval pma application was submitted on june  and is under review at the us food and drug administration fda 
a pivotal trial conducted to establish the safety and effectiveness of melafind was performed under the auspices of a protocol agreement 
in addition  the melafind pma has been granted expedited review by the fda 
on november   the company s pma application for melafind was reviewed by the fda s general and plastic surgery devices panel 
the panel voted favorably on all three questions instructed by the fda 
the fda advisory panel vote is non binding on the fda 
in february  the company submitted a pma amendment containing a revised indications for use statement limiting melafind to use by dermatologists  based on discussions that ensued during the panel meeting 
the company has requested a meeting with the fda to review the panel outcome as well as the company s pma and pma amendment 
upon obtaining approval from the fda  we plan to launch melafind commercially in the united states 
also in  the company initiated steps toward being able to introduce the melafind device commercially in europe 
the company is actively planning representation  conducting market research activities and working with european regulatory agencies on achieving conformite europeenne ce marking of melafind 
our revenue for the foreseeable future will depend on the approval of melafind by the fda and or european regulatory agencies and the commercialization of melafind  and may vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter 
our operating expenses may also vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter based upon the results of the regulatory reviews 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful and should not be relied on as indicative of our future performance 
we commenced operations in december as a new york corporation and re incorporated as a delaware corporation in september since our inception  we have generated significant losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to spend significant amounts on the pma submission  fda and european approval processes and  when approved  commercialization costs of melafind 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand as of december  will be sufficient to fund our anticipated level of operations for at least the ensuing twelve months 
we will however need to raise additional funds in order to achieve significant commercialization of melafind and generate significant revenues 

table of contents most of our expenditures to date have been for research and development activities and general and administrative expenses 
research and development expenses represent costs incurred for product development  clinical trials and activities relating to regulatory filings and manufacturing development efforts 
we expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred 
our research and development expenses incurred for the year ended december  were related primarily to the development of melafind and review of the melafind pma by the fda 
we expect to continue to incur additional research and development expenses relating to melafind prior to its commercial launch in the us and selected markets outside the us these additional expenses are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with clinical trials and the fda regulatory review and approval process 
as a result  these additional expenses could exceed our estimated amounts  possibly materially  especially if the fda requires additional clinical trials to support approval of melafind 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related human resources expenses  legal expenses  including litigation expenses and general corporate activities and costs associated with our efforts toward development of a commercial infrastructure to market and sell melafind 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase as we build our sales force and marketing capabilities to support placing melafind in the us and selected markets outside the us at december   we had available income tax benefit from net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax reporting purposes of approximately million 
the net operating loss carryforwards may be available to offset future taxable income expiring at various dates through the year the company s ability to utilize its net operating losses may be significantly limited due to changes in the company s ownership as defined by federal income tax regulations 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our judgments related to accounting estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements included in this annual report  we believe that the following accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates relating to revenue recognition  stock based compensation charges  and accrued expenses are most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
revenue recognition the company has not received fda or other regulatory approval for the sale of melafind and has had no revenues from products since when it discontinued its difoti operations 
stock based compensation we account for non employee stock based awards in which goods or services are the consideration received for the equity instruments issued based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued in accordance with fasb asc  equity based payments to non employees 
we record compensation expense associated with stock options and other forms of equity compensation in accordance with fasb asc  compensation stock compensation  as interpreted by sec staff accounting bulletins no 
and no 
a compensation charge is recorded  when it is probable that performance conditions will be satisfied  over the period estimated to satisfy the performance condition 
the probability of vesting is updated at each reporting period and compensation is adjusted prospectively 
we have also granted to certain employees stock options that vest with the attainment of performance milestones over which we have no control of the timing required to satisfy 
upon the attainment of these performance milestones  there will be a significant compensation charge based on the fair value of such options on the date granted 

table of contents accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service where we have not been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include professional service fees  contract clinical and regulatory related service fees  fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of melafind components or materials  and fees paid to third party data collection organizations and investigators in conjunction with the clinical trials and fda and other regulatory review 
in connection with such service fees  our estimates are most affected by our projections of the timing of services provided relative to the actual level of services incurred by such service providers 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our actual expenses could differ from such estimates 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us and accrue for such costs in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us this is done as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
results of operations in thousands year ended december  compared to year ended december  research and development expense research and development expense increased by to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this was primarily attributable to increased costs at askion of in r d labor and in product improvements offset by a reduction of our clinical trial costs following completion of the pivotal trial related activities

as kavo has not re launched difoti as of year end  the company earned the minimum annual royalty of in both and there was a gain of on the disposal of fixed assets in 
table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  research and development expense research and development expense decreased by  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to a  reduction of our clinical trial costs following completion of the pivotal trial and a reduction in our development costs as the melafind design was finalized 
offsetting these decreases was increased spending of in quality regulatory associated with the pma submission and fda review process 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased by  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ending december  this was principally attributable to an increase of  in marketing costs

to date  we have not borrowed other than by issuing convertible notes  all of which have been converted into equity or financed our operations through equipment leases  financing loans or other debt instruments 
as of december   we had  in cash and cash equivalents as compared to  at december  the increase in from reflects the  of net cash provided by financing activities offset by  of net cash used in operating activities and  of net cash used in investing activities

operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we face certain risks and uncertainties  which are present in many emerging medical device companies 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
to date  we have not commercialized our principal product  melafind 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future as we proceed with the melafind pma approval process  expand our corporate infrastructure  and prepare for the potential commercial launch of melafind 
we do not expect to generate significant product revenue until we successfully obtain pma approval for and begin selling melafind 
in order to achieve significant commercialization of melafind  we will need to obtain additional funding 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and the interest we earn on these balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months  whether or not we achieve commercial launch of melafind 
however  if our existing cash is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  or if we develop additional products  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility  which will be even more difficult due to the lack of available capital as a result of the current global economic crisis 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities would have rights senior to those associated with our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
any additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of  delay or eliminate some or all of planned product research development and commercialization activities  which could harm our business 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of medical devices such as melafind and operating our company  we are unable to estimate the exact amounts of capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current regulatory review process 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to the schedule  costs  and results of our clinical trials  the success of our research and development efforts in product creation and enhancement  and meeting competitive services and technologies  the costs and timing of regulatory approval  reimbursement amounts for the use of melafind that we are able to obtain from medicare and third party payers  the cost of commercialization activities  including product marketing and building a domestic direct sales force  the amount of direct payments we are able to obtain from patients and or physicians utilizing melafind  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other rights  the costs involved in defending any patent infringement actions or other litigation claims brought against us by third parties  the costs of maintaining or potentially building our inventory and other manufacturing expenses  and our ability to establish and maintain any collaborative  licensing or other arrangements  and the terms and timing of any such arrangements

off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have  nor have we ever had  any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued asu  an update that improves the requirements related to fair value measurements and disclosures subtopic of the fasb accounting standards codification originally issued as fasb statement this update requires enhanced disclosures about transfers between level and level assets and the disaggregated activity in the roll forward for level fair value measurements 
except for the detailed level roll forward disclosures  these new disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
the requirement to provide detailed disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward activity for level fair value measurements is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of asu to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk at december  is confined to our cash and cash equivalents 
we invest in cash and money market accounts with commercial banks 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
while declines in interest rates do impact the amount of interest income that our cash and cash equivalents will earn  we do not believe that we have any material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments  due to the nature of our accounts
