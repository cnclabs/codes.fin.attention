results of operations for simplicity of the following analysis  when referring to offset printing paper  we include any sales revenue and cost of sales of high grade offset printing paper  writing paper  white card paper  diazo paper and copy paper into the category of offset printing paper 
comparison of the years ended december  and revenue of offset printing paper and corrugating medium paper revenue from sales of offset printing paper and corrugating medium paper for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or from  for the comparable period in nevertheless  total paper sold during the year ended december  amounted to  tons  a decrease of  tons or  compared to  tons sold in the previous year 
the changes in revenue dollar amount and in tonnage from year to year are summarized as the followings year ended year ended percentage december  december  change in change sales revenue qty

ton amount corrugating medium paper medium grade offset printing paper high grade offset printing paper n a n a writing paper n a n a white card paper n a n a diazo paper and copy paper n a n a total corrugating medium and printing paper sales revenue revenue from corrugating medium paper amounted to  or of total offset printing paper and corrugating medium paper revenue for the year ended december   representing a  or decrease over the corrugating medium paper revenue of  for the comparable period in we sold  tons of corrugating medium paper in the year ended december  versus  tons sold a year ago  representing a drop in quantities sold  due to the disposal of one of our corrugating medium paper production lines in june and the temporary loss of two boilers during the last two quarters of the year see below 
despite the decrease in sales quantity  average selling price asp for corrugating medium paper rose from ton in year to ton in  representing a increase over the comparable period 
we believe the increase in asp is primarily attributable to increasing customer demand  the overall increased market price caused by relatively high wood pulp prices in the first half of year  and most importantly a regional shortage in paper products supply  caused by mandatory closures of other smaller paper manufacturers under government mandates 
for example  the provincial government of hebei announced on june  that it was working on closing inefficient paper production lines with local paper mills by the end of the year  accounting for an elimination of annual capacity of approximately  tons this year  while the neighboring province of henan announced that it was closing more than local paper mills with an aggregate capacity of over  tons of paper production 
unless further government mandated capacity closure is implemented  we believe the asp of major paper products may stabilize in the first quarter of year beginning in late june  we shut down and later demolished one of our two corrugating medium paper production lines 
we had originally planned to build a new  ton year new corrugating medium paper production line and other facilities on some  square meters of land across the street from our current main manufacturing compound  but due to certain changes in the plan  we decided to instead build the new production line in our current manufacturing compound 
to make room for the new production line and related pulping facilities  we tore down two existing buildings and an existing corrugating medium paper production line 
we estimate the lost capacity could be approximately  tons per year 
the new corrugating medium paper production line is expected to begin production in the second quarter of in connection with the government s approval of our pending new corrugating medium paper production line  the baoding city environmental protection agency required that we replace two of our four steam boilers with new and more energy efficient models 
we removed the two old boilers in july because of the loss of steam pressure  production quantities were lowered during this quarter 
the new boilers were fully installed and inspected by the government in january and were placed in production 
as a partial remedy for the lost production  starting in august the company entered into four offset printing paper supply agreements and one corrugating medium paper supply agreement with paper manufacturers in hebei province and the neighboring shandong province the supply agreements 
these paper supply agreements are all effective through the end of year during year  revenue generated from sales of corrugating medium paper finished goods purchased from these vendors pursuant to the supply agreements was in the amount of  or  tons  representing of annual sales revenue of corrugating medium paper in the year of revenue from medium grade offset printing paper amounted to  or of total offset printing paper and corrugating medium paper revenue for the year ended december   which represents a  or increase over the medium grade offset printing paper revenue of  for the comparable period in since the fourth quarter of  our only white paper based product has been medium grade offset printing paper 
as such  though we sold high grade offset printing paper which uses wood pulp as a raw material in year  there were no sales of high grade offset printing paper or writing paper in the entire year of we sold  tons of medium grade offset printing paper in the year compared to  tons of medium grade offset printing paper in the year  an increase of  tons or 
total white paper high and medium grade  plus writing paper and white card paper sold in the year amounted to  tons  or  versus  tons and  during the same period in while production and sales activities in the second half of were negatively impacted by the loss of two boilers  the factors contributing to the year net increase of  or in total white paper sales revenue include asp for offset printing paper products increased from ton in year to ton in the year  representing an annual increase of  the increase of production in the first half of year from the writing paper production line  which was converted to production of medium grade offset printing paper in  and additional revenue from the sales of offset printing paper finished goods purchased from other paper manufacturers 
out of the total medium grade offset printing paper sales revenue in year   or  tons  or of total medium grade offset printing paper revenue was attributable to sales of medium grade offset printing paper finished goods purchased from other vendors pursuant to the above supply agreements

cost of sales total cost of sales excluding cost of sales of digital photo paper  which was not produced and sold until march for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or from  for the comparable period in the increase in total cost of sales in year is primarily due to the net increased sales revenue in the year relative to the revenue in as explained above  total sales revenue excluding revenue from sales of digital photo paper grew from  in year to  in year  representing a year over year increase 
despite a decrease in tonnage of corrugating medium and offset printing paper products sold in year relative to tonnage sold in year  cost of sales of corrugating medium and offset printing paper per unit became higher in year than in year because of the higher unit cost and therefore  lower sales mark up for the sales of finished goods products purchased from other paper manufacturers under the supply agreements  and the inflated market costs of raw materials and energy in year as opposed to year monthly average purchase costs of our major raw materials for the period of january through december are as follows

except for the purchase cost of recycled paper board  which market price fluctuates depending on various economic factors  costs for the other types of raw materials in the two year period ended december  were on an upward trend and reached the highest point over the period toward the end of year we believe that all of the raw material prices will either remain stable or fluctuate slightly in the next few periods 
electricity and coal are the two main sources of energy for our paper manufacturing activities 
coal prices have been subject to seasonal fluctuations in china  with peaks often occurring in the winter months 
historically  electricity and coal account for approximately and of our total cost of sales  or approximately and of total sales  respectively 
the monthly energy costs electricity and coal as a percentage of total monthly cost of sales excluding the cost of sales purchased from other paper product suppliers and not manufactured by us in year of our main paper products for the two years ended december  are summarized as follows

the total cost of sales of digital photo paper amounted to  for the period from inception to december  gross profit gross profit for corrugating medium paper and offset printing paper for the year ended december  was  a net increase of  or from  for the comparable period in the net increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to various factors affecting the production activities and sales revenue in the year of  including the rise in product asps and the utilization of the writing paper machine that was converted to produce medium grade offset printing paper  offset by the interruption in production for the loss of two boilers in the second half of year the overall gross profit margin for corrugating medium paper and offset printing paper for the year ended december  increased slightly by  from a year ago to  because of reasons discussed above  offset by the substantially lower gross profit margins of the sales of the purchased finished good products 
gross profit margins for the purchased finished good of corrugating medium paper and offset printing paper during the year ended december  were and  respectively 
overall annual gross profit margins for corrugating medium paper and offset printing paper including those contributed by sales of purchased finished goods for the year ended december  were and  respectively 
gross profit from the sales of digital photo paper for the year ended december  amounted to  or as a percentage to total digital photo paper sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or from  for the comparable period in the increase was primarily attributable to payments of various professional service fees  investor relations  regulatory fees and  more specifically  legal and accounting fees incurred in connection with the independent investigation into certain allegations against the company during the second half of year for more information refer to item legal proceedings and notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december   total expenses incurred or accrued for the independent investigation and legal defense cost amounted to income from operations operating income for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or from  for the comparable period in the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in sales and gross profit of our corrugating medium paper and medium grade offset printing paper products as explained above  as well as the additional operating income in the amount of  from the digital photo paper operations since march net income net income was  for the year ended december   an increase of  or from  for the comparable period in the increase was primarily attributable to the increased sales revenue and gross profit and accretive net income from the digital photo paper operations  offset by the increased legal and accounting expenses during the second half of the year ended december accounts receivable accounts receivable and trade notes receivable increased slightly by  or to  including notes receivable in the amount of  as of december   compared with  as of december  we usually collect accounts receivable within days of delivery and completion of sales 
accounts receivable turnover  based on average accounts receivable using balances at the beginning and ending dates of the year and annual sales revenue for the entire year of  increased from times in year to times in year  while days in accounts receivable decreased from days in year to days in year we  similar to many other chinese business enterprises  tend to accelerate receivable collection toward the end of the calendar year to prepare for the upcoming chinese new year holidays 
therefore  accounts receivable and to a certain extent  the accounts payable balance usually appear lower than the balance during the rest of the year 
alternatively  accounts receivable turnover calculated using the average quarterly ending balances at the end of first  second  and third quarter of year was times with days in accounts receivable at days with comparable accounts receivable turnover and days in accounts receivable being times and days for the year ended december  
we usually collect the accounts receivable within days of delivery and completion of sales 
inventory inventory consists of raw materials accounting for of total value of ending inventory as of december  and finished goods 
as of december   the recorded value of our inventory has increased to  from  as of december  a summary of changes in major inventory items is as follows december  december  change change raw materials recycled paper board pulp recycled printed paper recycled white scrap paper coal digital photo base paper and other raw materials total raw materials finished goods totals to prepare for the launch of the new  tons corrugating medium paper production line  we have begun to purchase more recycled paper boards during the fourth quarter of year although our purchase price of recycled white scrap paper increased substantially in december for approximately as compared to the beginning of the year  we anticipate the price hike to be temporary and have not replenished the recycled white scrap paper at the level similar to the end of because of the increase in ending inventory at the end of year  inventory turnover of all items of inventory of the company decreased from times during the year to times in the year number of days in inventory increased from days in year to days for the year ended december  accounts payable accounts payable excluding non inventory purchase payables and accrued expenses was  as of december   a decrease of  or from one year ago 
the accounts payable balance decreased because  among other things and as explained above under the analysis of inventory  we purchased large quantities of recycled paper boards in november but purchased no recycled paper board in the following month of december 
the large november payable balance was mostly paid down as of december  liquidity and capital resources overview we had net working capital of  at december   an increase of  over a net working capital of  at december  the company finances its daily operations mainly by cash flows generated from its business operations and loans from banking institutions and major shareholders 
major capital expenditures in year and are financed by cash flows generated from business operations and by proceeds of equity financing transactions 
as of december  we had approximately  in capital expenditure commitments that were related to the construction of a new corrugating medium paper production line and will be satisfied by payment of cash within the next months 
we also intend to complete the acquisition of some  square meters of land within the next months 
the land acquisition is expected to consume an additional  in cash to pay for the financial compensation to current land owners and for the land use rights to the government 
we expect to finance the above capital expenditures and land acquisition with the net working capital of  the net cash inflows generated from year business operations  which is estimated to be at least  and if necessary  new loans from local chinese banks 
we do not have any firm commitment from the local banks with respect to new credit facilities in addition to the current bank borrowings  which aggregated to approximately  as of december  however  based on the present loan to equity ratio which is less than as of december   we do not believe the company will have any problem securing additional bank loans as needed 
the company currently does not have any specific plan for new equity financing in the next months 
cash and cash equivalents our cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year ended december  was  an increase of  from  as of december  the increase over the year balance was primarily attributable to a number of factors  including the following i 
net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december   representing an increase of  or from  for the comparable period in the net income for the year ended december  in the amount of  represented an increase of  or from  for the comparable period in in addition to the net income  there are certain non cash charges including depreciation in the amount of  and a one time charge of  for the loss on disposition of a smaller corrugating medium paper production line and two industrial buildings that were demolished for the purpose of constructing a new plant in late june that reduced the net income but did not have the effect of reducing the balance of cash and cash equivalents 
in addition to the non cash charges  net cash flow from operating activities was also affected by a decrease in accounts payable of  as well as increases in other accrued expenses and income tax payable for a total amount of  during the year of ii 
net cash used in investing activities the company incurred  in cash expenditures for investing activities  including  in purchases of new equipment and progress payments for the construction of a new corrugating medium paper production line and ancillary facilities and  for the first phase of the acquisition of a parcel of roughly  square meters of land across the street from our current main manufacturing facilities 
the total contract price for the new corrugating medium paper production equipment  which will have an annual capacity of  tons  is  and represents an unpaid purchase commitment in the next twelve months in the amount of  in addition  cost of contracts that we entered into to build other ancillary facilities for the new corrugating medium paper production line  including a new pulping station and water treatment plant  amounted to  of which  was unpaid as of december  total unpaid capital expenditure commitment as of december  was in the amount of  which we expect to pay for with current cash and cash equivalent balance of approximately million  additional bank loans  and or cash flows from operating activities in the next twelve months 
the company made a land acquisition deposit payment in june in the amount of  to the local residents council  which is in charge of the reimbursement and relocation of the residents who occupied the parcel of subject land that is a vital part of any future expansion of our facilities 
as of september   families of local residents on the subject land have contracted to surrender their land use rights representing roughly of the total land to be acquired and have been reimbursed 
the land acquisition process will continue throughout the rest of the year for us to obtain the title through the local government 
unsatisfied with the slow progress of the acquisition  we demanded partial returns of the deposit from the local resident village council in december and received two refunds in total amount of  in addition to the remaining deposit  to complete the land acquisition we estimate that the entire land acquisition process will require an additional  based on an estimated total average cost of approximately per square meter of cash payment in the next six to twelve months  which is expected to be paid for by future cash flows generated by our operating activities 
if  however  the relocation and financial restoration phase progress continue to stall for more than six to twelve months  we may demand the full refund of whatever deposit already made from the local resident village council 
iii

our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions  assumptions for operational performance of our businesses  and possible government policy toward operating efficiency of the chinese paper manufacturing industry 
for the years ended december  and  no events or circumstances occurred for which an evaluation of the recoverability of long lived assets was required 
we are currently not aware of any events or circumstances that may indicate any need to record such impairment in the future
