item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations constitutes management s review of the factors that affected our financial and operating performance for the years ended december   and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a development stage company and began the development of the mt 
hope project on october  during the year ended december  we also completed work on a pre feasibility study of our liberty property  which we plan to update by the end of using funds received from the exercise of outstanding warrants 
the development of the mt 
hope project has a project capital estimate of  million including development costs of approximately  million in dollars and million in cash financial assurance requirements and pre payments 
these amounts do not include financing costs or amounts necessary to fund operating working capital 
through the year ended december   we have spent approximately million on the mt 
hope project 
in  because of declining molybdenum prices and unanticipated delays in the permitting process  we implemented a cash conservation plan whereby total cash utilization  other than equipment purchases  was reduced to approximately million per month 
the worldwide molybdenum price fluctuated between per pound in to over per pound in and traded in the mid s per pound prior to october  when prices fell from approximately per pound to per pound in april as a result of the global economic collapse 
subsequent to april  prices slowly rose and finished the year at per pound and continued to increase in  finishing the year at per pound  resulting in an average price of in the permitting process for the mt 
hope project has also had an impact on our activities because of delays experienced from extensive regulatory reviews and additional requests for information on environmental impacts 
nevertheless  the process continues to move toward completion  and our efforts in this regard have continued full time 
once the major operating permits and the rod from the blm are effective  and financing is available  it is expected that mt 
hope can be constructed and in production within months 
the company has maintained its orders for grinding  milling  and other specialty long lead equipment 
however  other engineering  administrative and third party work has been slowed or suspended 
we plan to restart procurement and engineering efforts during as key milestones in the permitting process are reached 
the company had cash on hand at year end of million as well as million in warrant exercise proceeds received in early to meet its funding requirements for 
table of contents restructuring and suspension of project development based on our current cash on hand and our cash conservation plan  the company expects it will have adequate liquidity for operations  as modified  through the end of without accessing new sources of financing 
engineering efforts  approximately complete  have been largely suspended pending the availability of financing 
some engineering that is critical for permitting or project restart readiness  has continued at a slower pace 
we plan to restart procurement and engineering efforts during as key milestones in the permitting process are reached 
the company issued purchase orders for two types of equipment milling process equipment and mining equipment 
most equipment orders for the custom built grinding and other milling process equipment will be completed by the manufacturers and stored 
the grinding and milling process equipment require the longest lead times and maintaining these orders is critical to the company s ability to rapidly restart the mt 
hope project development 
the company has completed final negotiations with other equipment manufacturers to suspend or terminate fabrication of other milling equipment and to determine the equipment fabrication costs incurred to date  storage costs  and the expecting timing of restarting fabrication 
as additional financing becomes available and equipment procurement is restarted  agreements that were suspended or terminated will be renegotiated under the then current market terms and conditions  as necessary 
based on our current plan  expected timetable  and the results of such negotiations  we expect to make additional payments towards purchase of this equipment of approximately million under milling process equipment orders through the end of and million in as additional financing becomes available and equipment procurement is restarted  agreements that were suspended or terminated will be renegotiated under the then current market terms and conditions  as necessary 
the drills and loaders for the mine operation have been cancelled  and discussions for the purchase of the electric shovels are complete and this order was amended and remains in effect 
an agreement has been reached with a truck manufacturer to hold production slots for timely delivery 
once financing is available  the company anticipates placing orders for this mining equipment again 
the company will continue to evaluate all options to facilitate a timely re start of the project development 
the mt 
hope llc agreement effective as of january   we contributed all of our interest in the assets related to the mt 
hope project  including our lease of the mt 
hope project into a newly formed entity  eureka moly  llc  a delaware limited liability company llc  and in february closing date entered into an agreement llc agreement for the development and operation of the mt 
hope project with pos minerals corporation pos minerals an affiliate of posco  a large korean steel company 
under the llc agreement  pos minerals owns a interest in the llc and general moly  through a wholly owned subsidiary  owns an interest 
these ownership interests and or required contributions under the llc agreement can change as discussed below 
pursuant to the terms of the llc agreement  pos minerals made its first and second cash contributions to the llc totaling million during the year ended december  initial contributions 
additional amounts will be due from pos minerals within days after the date rod contribution date that specified conditions rod contribution conditions have been satisfied 
the rod contribution conditions are the receipt of major operating permits for the project  that the rod from the blm for the project has become effective  and any administrative or judicial appeals with respect thereto are final 
we are currently targeting the effectiveness of the rod and the satisfaction of the other rod contribution conditions to occur six to nine months after publication of the deis in the federal register  but circumstances beyond our control  including reviewing agency delays or requests for additional information or studies  and requests for review or appeals of the blm decision  could cause the effectiveness of the rod and or the satisfaction of the other rod contribution conditions to be further delayed 
to maintain its interest in the llc  pos minerals will be required to make an additional million contribution plus its share of all mt 
hope project costs incurred from the closing date to the rod contribution date within days after the rod contribution date 
if pos minerals does not make its additional million contribution when due after the rod contribution date  its interest will be reduced to 
in addition  as commercial production at the mt 
hope project will not occur by december   the llc may be required to return to pos minerals million of its contributions to the llc  with no corresponding reduction in pos minerals ownership percentage 
based on our current plan and assuming pos minerals has made its additional million contribution  a payment to pos minerals of million will be due days after the commencement of 
table of contents commercial production  as defined by the llc agreement 
if pos minerals does not make its additional million contribution when due  no return of contribution is required by us 
our wholly owned subsidiary and owner of the llc  nevada moly  llc nevada moly  is obligated under the terms of the llc agreement to make capital contributions to fund the return of contributions to pos minerals  if required 
if nevada moly does not make these capital contributions  pos minerals has an election to either make a secured loan to the llc to fund the return of contributions  or receive an additional interest in the llc of approximately 
in the latter case  our interest in the llc is subject to dilution by a percentage equal to the ratio of times the amount of the unpaid contributions over the aggregate amount of deemed capital contributions as determined under the llc agreement of both parties to the llc dilution formula 
at december   the aggregate amount of deemed capital contributions of both parties was million 
furthermore  the llc agreement permits pos minerals to put its interest in the llc to nevada moly after a change of control of nevada moly or the company  as defined in the llc agreement  followed by a failure to use standard mining industry practice in connection with development and operation of the project as contemplated by the parties for a period of twelve consecutive months 
if pos minerals puts its interest  nevada moly or the transferee or surviving entity would be required to purchase the interest for of pos minerals contributions to the llc plus interest per annum 
the initial contributions of million that were made by pos minerals during were expended by the second quarter of in accordance with the program and budget requirements of the mt 
hope project 
nevada moly is required  pursuant to the terms of the llc agreement  to advance funds required to pay costs for the development of the mt 
hope project that exceed the initial contributions until the rod contribution date  at which point the contributions described above to be made by pos minerals will be applied to reimburse us for pos minerals share of such development costs 
pos minerals share of such development costs amounted to approximately million as of december  all costs incurred after the rod contribution date will be allocated and funded pro rata based on each party s ownership interest 
the interest of a party in the llc that does not make its pro rata capital contributions to fund costs incurred after the rod contribution date is subject to dilution based on the dilution formula

table of contents liquidity  capital resources and capital requirements year ended december  compared to year ended december  our total consolidated cash balance at december  was million compared to million at december  the increase in our cash balances for the year ended december  was due primarily to proceeds from the sale of tranche equity to hanlong of million  million advanced under the bridge loan  and million from the exercise of outstanding warrants offset by development costs incurred of million  deposits on property plant and equipment totaling million  and general and administrative costs of million 
deposits on property  plant and equipment relate primarily to scheduled payments for long lead time equipment for the mt 
hope project 
see contractual obligations below 
in addition  we received million in early from the exercise of outstanding warrants 
total assets as of december  increased to million compared to million as of december  primarily as a result of the cash received upon issuance of the tranche shares to hanlong and proceeds from the draw down of the tranche bridge loan 
as discussed above under permitting and water rights update  we currently anticipate the effectiveness of the rod and the satisfaction of the other rod contribution conditions to occur six to nine months after publication of the deis in the federal register  but circumstances beyond our control could cause the effectiveness of the rod and or the satisfaction of the other rod contribution conditions to be delayed 
as discussed above under securities purchase agreement with hanlong usa mining investment inc  we have signed a series of agreements with hanlong that form the basis of a significant investment by hanlong in the company that is intended to provide the company with adequate capital to develop the mt

we paid million in advance royalties in early as a result of the exercise of outstanding warrants 
based on our project capital estimate we estimate that million remains unpaid related to the construction royalty advance 
based on the current estimate of raising capital and developing and operating the mine  we believe that  or million  of the llc s remaining construction royalty advance will be paid on october  the remaining must be paid on or before october  accordingly  based on our current cash on hand and our cash conservation plan  the company expects it will have adequate liquidity for operations through the year ended december  without accessing new sources of financing 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  our cash balance at december  was million compared to million at december  the decrease in our cash balances for the year ended december  was due primarily to development costs incurred of million  deposits on property plant and equipment totaling million  and general and administrative costs of million

for the year ended december   the liberty property remained on a care and maintenance status  and  accordingly  the resulting exploration and evaluation expenses are considerably lower for the year 

table of contents for the year ended december  and  general and administrative expenses were million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december  general and administrative costs were significantly higher than in as a greater amount of equity compensation was incurred as a result of the impact of increasing share prices on equity compensation plans and additional awards granted 
for the year ended december   writedowns of development and deposits was million as a result of the company s relinquishment of a land lease held by the llc in eureka county  nevada 
the llc had invested million in preliminary development costs for the property covered by the lease 
as a result of the relinquishment  these costs were written off by the company 
interest income was nil for the years ended december  and as a result of low interest rates and cash balances in both years

contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of december  were as follows payments due by period in millions contractual obligations total beyond long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations equipment purchase contracts advance royalties and deferral fees provision for post closure reclamation and remediation total 
table of contents at december   we have a contract to purchase two electric shovels that is cancellable and has no firm schedule of payments 
we also have a non binding letter of agreement on haul trucks that establishes our priority for delivery 
both agreements provide for the then current pricing using market indices upon initiation of an order 
we have active orders with varying stages of fabrication on milling process equipment comprised of two kv primary transformers and substation  a primary crusher  a semi autogenous mill  two ball mills  and various motors for the mills 
we have suspended fabrication on flotation cells  lime slaking equipment  hydrocyclones  and other smaller milling process equipment with the ability to re initiate fabrication at any time 
we have completed negotiations with the manufacturer of two multi hearth molybdenum roasters to terminate its fabrication of this equipment and receive finished goods of the partially completed order 
we plan to re establish a new purchase order with this manufacturer as financing becomes available and equipment procurement is restarted under then current market terms and conditions 
the following table sets forth the llc s remaining cash commitments under purchase contracts at december   resulting from the re negotiation and cancelation of certain purchase contracts as discussed above in millions 
period cash commitments under equipment purchase contracts as of december  st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter total total cash commitments under purchase contracts consist of million under milling process equipment orders 
based on our current plan  we expect to make additional payments of approximately million under these milling process equipment orders through the end of  and million in as financing becomes available and equipment procurement is restarted  agreements that were suspended or terminated will be renegotiated under the then current market terms and conditions  as necessary 
if the company does not make payments required under the purchase contracts  it could be subject to claims for breach of contract or to cancellation of the purchase contract 
in addition  we may proceed to selectively suspend  cancel or attempt to renegotiate additional purchase contracts if we are forced to further conserve cash 
see liquidity and capital resources above 
if we cancel or breach any contracts  we will take all appropriate action to minimize any losses  but could be subject to claims or penalties under the contracts or applicable law 
the cancellation of certain key contracts would cause a delay in the commencement of operations  have ramifications under the llc agreement with pos minerals and would add to the cost to develop our interest in the mt 
hope project 
critical accounting policies and estimates estimates the process of preparing financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding certain types of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
such estimates primarily relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the financial statements 
accordingly  upon settlement  actual results may differ from estimated amounts 

table of contents provision for taxes income taxes are provided based upon the liability method of accounting 
under this approach  deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end 
in accordance with authoritative guidance for income taxes  a valuation allowance is recorded against the deferred tax asset if management does not believe the company has met the more likely than not standard to allow recognition of such an asset 
property  plant and equipment the company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if the sum of estimated future net cash flows on an undiscounted basis is less than the carrying amount of the related asset grouping  asset impairment is considered to exist 
the related impairment loss is measured by comparing estimated future net cash flows on a discounted basis to the carrying amount of the asset 
changes in significant assumptions underlying future cash flow estimates may have a material effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
to date no such impairments have been identified 
property and equipment are being depreciated over useful lives of three to seven years using straight line depreciation 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with authoritative guidance for share based payments 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating expected dividends and estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
contingently redeemable noncontrolling interest on january   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance related to noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  the provisions of which  among others  require the recognition of a noncontrolling interest previously referred to as minority interest  as a component of equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity for all periods presented 
in addition  the amount of net income or loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest is included in net income or loss on the face of the consolidated statement of operations 
under gaap  certain noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities meet the definition of mandatorily redeemable financial instruments if the ability to redeem the interest is outside of the control of the consolidating entity 
as described in note  the llc agreement permits pos minerals the option to put its interest in the llc to nevada moly upon a change of control  as defined in the llc agreement  followed by i failure to begin full construction at the llc by the company or the surviving entity before december   or ii failure to use standard mining industry practice in connection with development and operation of the project as contemplated by the parties for a period of twelve months after december  as such  the contingently redeemable noncontrolling interest has continued to be shown as a separate caption between liabilities and equity mezzanine section 
the carrying value of the contingently redeemable noncontrolling interest of pos minerals reflects the investment of the noncontrolling interest  less losses attributable to the interest 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we are a development stage company in the business of the exploration  development and mining of properties primarily containing molybdenum 
as a result  upon commencement of production  our financial performance could be materially affected by fluctuations in the market price of molybdenum and other metals we may mine 
the market prices of metals can fluctuate widely due to a number of factors 
these factors include fluctuations with respect to the rate of inflation  the exchange rates of the us dollar and other currencies  interest rates  global or regional political and economic conditions  banking environment  global and regional demand  production costs  and investor sentiment 
in order to better manage commodity price risk and to seek to reduce the negative impact of fluctuations in prices  we will seek to enter into long term supply contracts 
on december   we entered into a molybdenum supply 
table of contents agreement with arcelormittal that provides for arcelormittal to purchase million pounds of molybdenum per year  plus or minus  once the mt 
hope project commences commercial operations at minimum specified levels 
the supply agreement provides for a floor price along with a discount for spot prices above the floor price and expires five years after the commencement of commercial production at the mt 
hope project 
both the floor and threshold levels at which the percentage discounts change are indexed to a producer price index 
on april   arcelormittal and the company entered into an extension molybdenum supply agreement  providing arcelormittal with a five year option to make effective an agreement to purchase from the company million pounds of molybdenum per year for years following the expiration of the initial supply agreement 
the additional optional off take will be priced in alignment with the company s existing supply agreements 
in order for arcelormittal to exercise this option and make the extension agreement effective  arcelormittal must have beneficial ownership of more than million shares of company common stock on or prior to april  according to public filings  on january   the boards of directors of arcelormittal sa and aperam each approved the transfer of the assets comprising arcelormittal s stainless and specialty steels businesses from its carbon steel and mining businesses to aperam  a separate entity incorporated in the grand duchy of luxembourg 
this transfer included the off take agreement the company had in place with arcelormittal and the shares of the company s common stock previously owned by arcelormittal 
additionally  on may   we entered into a molybdenum supply agreement with seah besteel corporation seah besteel  korea s largest manufacturer of specialty steels  which provides for seah besteel to purchase million pounds of molybdenum per year  plus or minus  once the mt 
hope project commences commercial operations at minimum specified levels 
like the arcelormittal supply agreement  the supply agreement with seah besteel provides for a floor price along with staged discounts for spot prices above the floor price and expires five years from the date of first supply under the agreement 
both the floor and threshold levels at which the percentage discounts change are indexed to a producer price index 
on august   the company entered into a molybdenum supply agreement sojitz agreement with sojitz corporation 
the sojitz agreement provides for the supply of million pounds per year of molybdenum for five years  beginning once the mt 
hope project reaches certain minimum commercial production levels 
one million annual pounds sold under the sojitz agreement will be subject to a per pound molybdenum floor price and is offset by a flat discount to spot moly prices above the floor 
the remaining million annual pounds sold under the sojitz agreement will be sold with reference to spot moly prices without regard to a floor price 
the sojitz agreement includes a provision for cancellation in the event that supply from the mt 
hope project has not begun by january  on march   the company entered into a molybdenum supply agreement hanlong agreement with hanlong
