item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary our financial and operating results for declined compared with the prior year 
this included decreases in total sales and gross margins  while selling  general and administrative expenses increased 
these factors resulted in an operating loss for compared with operating income for the year marked the completion and introduction of a number of new products  the most significant of which was p trunking 
we believe that these new products position us for sales growth in the future 
total sales for decreased to approximately million compared with approximately million for the prior year 
lower sales to the us department of defense dod as well some other federal and state agencies were partially offset by sales gains with legacy customers and products 
sales of p digital products increased to approximately million in from million in improved p sales were fueled by new products and customers associated with our expanding kng line of radios  including our new p trunking products  which enabled us to enter segments of the market previously outside the scope of our capabilities 
gross margins as a percentage of sales in were compared with for the prior year 
the decline in gross margins reflects a combination of factors including additional manufacturing costs  some of which relate to new product production  and competitive pricing pressures 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased approximately million to approximately million compared with last year 
this increase is primarily the result of engineering expenses for the development of p trunking and other of our new kng products 
we also incurred additional sales and marketing expenses primarily to promote the kng line 
kng products are expected to increase our addressable markets 
we anticipate adding more new products to the kng line in the future 
we reported a pretax loss for of  compared with pretax income of approximately million last year 
for  we recognized income tax expense of approximately  compared with income tax expense of approximately million last year 
our income tax benefit and expense are largely non cash  relating to deferred items including nol carryforwards 
net loss for was approximately  per basic share  compared with net income of approximately million per basic and per diluted share for the prior year 
as of december   working capital totaled approximately million  of which million was comprised of cash and trade receivables 
as of the end of the prior year  working capital totaled approximately million  of which million was comprised of cash and trade receivables 
also  as of december   we had million in borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility  compared with no borrowings outstanding as of the end of the prior year 
we experience seasonality in our results in part due to governmental customer spending patterns that are influenced by government fiscal year end budgets and appropriations 
we also experience seasonality in our results in part due to our concentration of sales to federal and state agencies that participate in fire suppression efforts  which are typically the greatest during the summer season when forest fire activity is heightened 
in some years  these factors may cause an increase in sales for the second and third quarters compared with the first and fourth quarters of the same fiscal year 
such increases in sales may cause quarterly variances in our cash flow from operations and overall financial condition 
results of operations as an aid to understanding our operating results  the following table shows items from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percent of sales percent of sales for years ended december sales cost of products gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses net interest expense income loss income before income tax expense benefit income tax expense benefit net loss income fiscal year compared with fiscal year sales  net sales in decreased million to approximately million compared with million for the prior year 
sales of p digital products in increased million to approximately million  compared with million for the decrease in total sales compared with the prior year was attributed primarily to a decline in orders from agencies of the dod as well as some other federal and state agencies 
various agencies of the dod remain an important part of our strategic plans for growth 
the overall decrease in total sales was partially offset by increased sales with legacy customers such as the usfs and doi purchasing our d series p digital radios 
during  we added several products to our kng line of p digital radios 
most important was the fourth quarter launch of our p digital trunked products  the first such products in relm s history 
this now enables us to address a significant portion of the land mobile radio market that previously was beyond the scope of our product line 
we anticipate bringing to market additional new p products and features in coming quarters 
we believe these products will increase our addressable market and  accordingly  improve our prospects for gaining market share and sales growth 
cost of products and gross margins cost of products as a percentage of sales for was compared with in our cost of products and gross margins are primarily related to product mix  manufacturing volumes and pricing 
compared with last year  our gross margins for the year reflected reduced sales and the impact of additional manufacturing costs  some of which relate to the start of new product production 
competitive pricing considerations and a change in the mix of products sold were also contributing factors 
we continue to utilize contract manufacturing relationships to maximize production efficiencies and minimize material and labor costs 
we also regularly consider manufacturing alternatives to improve quality  speed and to reduce our product costs 
we anticipate that the current contract manufacturing relationships or comparable alternatives will be available to us in the future 
leveraging increased sales volumes and p product sales combined with improved effectiveness in the production of new products  we believe  should result in cost improvements and efficiencies 
we anticipate that product cost and competitive pricing pressures will continue in the future  however  the extent of their impact on gross margins is uncertain 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist of marketing  sales  commissions  engineering  product development  management information systems  accounting  headquarters expenses and non cash share based employee compensation expense 
for  sg a expenses increased approximately million to approximately million or of sales compared with approximately million or of sales for the prior year 
engineering and product development expenses in increased by million compared with last year 
this increase was largely the result of efforts to advance the completion and launch of our p trunking capability  as well as other p radios and features in our expanding kng product line 
additional new products in our kng line are in the development process  and are planned for introduction in the future 
marketing and selling expenses in increased by approximately  compared with last year 
during the year we increased sales staffing and incurred additional sales and marketing expenses focused on raising the profile of our new kng product line and capabilities  and penetrating new markets and customers 
general and administrative expenses in increased by approximately  compared with last year primarily due to non cash share based employee compensation expense 
operating loss income we reported an operating loss of approximately  for  compared with operating income of approximately million last year 
during  total sales decreased million  or  from the previous year and there were additional manufacturing costs  some of which were associated with production of new products 
also  the mix of product sales was less favorable 
interest expense  net for  we incurred approximately  in net interest expense compared with approximately  for the prior year 
we earn interest income on our cash balances and incur interest expense on borrowings from our revolving line of credit 
we had million in borrowings outstanding under the credit facility as of december   compared with no borrowings outstanding as of the end of the prior year 
the interest rate on such revolving credit facility as of december  was per annum 
this rate is variable based on the prime rate plus basis points 
income tax expense we recorded net income tax expense of approximately  for compared with approximately million last year 
our income tax expense is largely non cash as a result of the deferred tax asset related primarily to federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   we had deferred tax assets of approximately million  which was materially unchanged from the start of the year 
these assets are primarily composed of net operating loss carry forwards nols  which are available to offset federal and state taxable income 
the nols expire starting in through in order to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets  we will need to generate sufficient taxable income in future years to utilize our nols prior to their expiration 
asc topic  income taxes  requires us to analyze all positive and negative evidence to determine if  based on the weight of available evidence  we are more likely than not to realize the benefit of the net deferred tax assets 
the recognition of the net deferred tax assets and related tax benefits is based upon our conclusions regarding  among other considerations  estimates of future earnings based on information currently available  current and anticipated customers  contracts and product introductions  as well as recent operating results during  and  and certain tax planning strategies 
we have evaluated the available evidence and the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our net deferred tax assets 
from our evaluation we have concluded that based on the weight of available evidence  we are more likely than not to not realize a portion of the benefit of our net deferred tax assets recorded at december  accordingly  we established a valuation allowance totaling approximately  for the portion of benefit of deferred tax assets that more likely than not will not be realized 
we cannot presently estimate what  if any  changes to the valuation of our deferred tax assets may be deemed appropriate in the future 
if we incur future losses  it may be necessary to record a valuation allowance related to the deferred tax assets recognized as of december  accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method specified by asc topic income taxes  as modified by asc topic deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the period in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized 
the effect of changes in net deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income in the period in which the change is recognized 
valuation allowances are provided to the extent that impairment of tax assets are more likely than not 
in determining whether a tax asset is realizable  we consider among other things  estimates of future earnings based on information currently available  current and anticipated customers  contracts and new product introductions  as well as recent operating results during  and  and certain tax planning strategies 
if we fail to achieve the future results anticipated in the calculation and valuation of net deferred tax assets  we may be required to adjust our valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets in the future 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year sales  net sales in increased million to approximately million compared with million for the prior year 
sales of p digital products in increased million to approximately million  compared with million for orders announced in  primarily for p digital products from the us departments of defense dod  agriculture and interior during the year contributed to our sales growth 
the orders from the dod were particularly important  as they represent sales to new customers  and for products in frequencies that we historically did not offer 
these larger orders were supplemented by a strengthened flow of smaller run rate procurements and an expanded addressable market made possible by our line of kng products 
we believe our late inclusion in a blanket purchase agreement bpa from the us general services administration was a contributing factor 
the total estimated value of this bpa was million to various suppliers over a maximum term of five years  and it is being utilized by various federal government agencies for the purchase of a wide range of analog and p digital radio equipment 
we realized market share gains in with several federal agencies 
according to procurement information published by the federal government  total spending by these agencies decreased in compared to  however their purchases of relm products increased 
during the year we significantly expanded our p digital product offerings with the introduction of new radio models  some of which addressed customers and markets that were previously outside the scope of our products 
cost of products and gross margins cost of products as a percentage of sales for was compared with in our cost of products and gross margins were primarily related to product mix  manufacturing volumes and pricing 
our gross margins for the year reflected increased manufacturing volumes and an improved sales mix of higher margin p digital products 
as a consequence of higher manufacturing volumes  we more fully utilized and absorbed our base of manufacturing and support expenses  favorably impacting product unit costs and gross margins 
these improvements were partially offset by competitive pricing pressures 
we utilized contract manufacturing relationships to maximize production efficiencies and minimize material and labor costs 
we also regularly considered manufacturing alternatives to improve quality  speed and to reduce our product costs 
we anticipate that these contract manufacturing relationships or comparable alternatives will be available to us in the future 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist of marketing  sales  commissions  engineering  product development  management information systems  accounting  headquarters expenses and non cash share based employee compensation expense 
for  sg a expenses declined million to approximately million or of sales compared with approximately million or of sales for the prior year 
engineering and product development expenses in declined by  compared with last year 
the completion of several digital development initiatives and the related new product introductions enabled us to reduce the associated engineering costs compared with additional new products in our kng line were in the development process  and introduced in marketing and selling expenses in decreased by approximately  compared with last year 
during the second half of and the first quarter  we reduced selling expenses and payroll in response to sluggish sales and an uncertain forecast 
we maintained this lower expense structure during the remainder of the year 
in  we invested in selling and marketing initiatives focused on raising the profile of our new kng product line  and expanding into new markets and customers 
general and administrative expenses in decreased by approximately  compared with last year primarily due to reductions in professional fees and headquarters expenses 
operating income we reported operating income of approximately million for  compared with an operating loss of approximately million last year 
during  total sales increased from the previous year and the mix of product sales was more favorable  with a larger volume of p digital sales in additionally  operating expenses declined approximately million in compared with these factors combined to increase operating income 
interest income expense  net for  we incurred approximately  in net interest expense compared with net interest income of approximately  for the prior year 
we earned interest income on our cash balances and incurred interest expense on borrowings from our revolving line of credit 
the decline in net interest income and increase in interest expense was derived from our lower cash position in the first half of the year  and lower interest rates 
also  we incurred interest on borrowings under our revolving credit facility during the first two quarters in in we did not borrow 
we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility as of december  the interest rate on such revolving credit facility as of december  was per annum 
this rate was variable based on the prime rate plus basis points subject to a reduction of basis points anytime our quarterly net income is greater than million 
income taxes benefits we recorded net income tax expense of approximately million for compared with an income tax benefit of million last year 
our income tax expenses and benefits are largely non cash as a result of the deferred tax asset related primarily to federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   we had deferred tax assets of approximately million compared with million at the start of the year 
these assets are primarily composed of net operating loss carry forwards nols  which are available to offset federal and state taxable income 
the nols expire starting in through in order to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets  we must generate sufficient taxable income in future years to utilize our nols prior to their expiration 
asc topic  income taxes  requires us to analyze all positive and negative evidence to determine if  based on the weight of available evidence  we are more likely than not to realize the benefit of the net deferred tax assets 
the recognition of the net deferred tax assets and related tax benefits is based upon our conclusions regarding  among other considerations  estimates of future earnings based on information currently available  current and anticipated customers  contracts and product introductions  as well as recent operating results and certain tax planning strategies 
we evaluated the available evidence and the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our net deferred tax assets 
from our evaluation we concluded that based on the weight of available evidence we were more likely than not to realize the benefit of our net deferred tax assets recorded at december  accordingly  no valuation allowance was established 
we could not estimate what  if any  changes to the valuation of our deferred tax assets may be deemed appropriate in the future 
if we incur future losses  it may be necessary to record a valuation allowance related to the deferred tax assets recorded as of december  changing prices inflation for the years ended december   and did not have a material impact on our operations 
in some instances during  product unit prices were reduced to enhance our competitive position and sales prospects  which reduced gross margins 
we anticipate that competitive pricing pressure will continue in the future 
the extent of its impact is uncertain 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities totaled approximately million  compared with net cash provided by operating activities of approximately million last year 
cash used in operating activities in was primarily the result of a million increase in net inventories compared with a decrease of million last year 
net inventories increased during the year as we stocked newly introduced models in our kng product line  and total sales decreased 
also  for we realized a net loss of  compared with net income of approximately million last year 
due to a slower collection cycle  accounts receivable in increased by  compared with a million increase last year due to sales growth 
deferred tax assets for remained materially unchanged from the prior year as the tax benefit associated with our pretax loss for the year was offset by a valuation allowance of  established for the amount of deferred tax assets that more likely than not we will not realize 
last year deferred tax assets decreased by approximately million due to utilization of net operating losses to cover pretax income for the year 
depreciation and amortization totaled approximately  for  compared with  last year 
the increase was driven primarily by amortization of our p trunking software  which commenced in accounts payable increased during by approximately million related primarily to increased inventory purchases 
for the prior year  accounts payable decreased approximately million 
cash used in investing activities was primarily to fund the acquisition of assets for our new digital products 
during we incurred approximately million for capitalized software compared with approximately million for the prior year 
capital expenditures during were primarily for the purchase of test equipment and tooling for new products  totaling approximately  compared with approximately  for we anticipate that future capital expenditures will be funded through our existing cash balance  operating cash flow and our revolving credit facility 
cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately million for  representing million in borrowings from our revolving credit facility  and  in proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
last year  we used million to fully repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
we have a secured revolving credit facility with silicon valley bank svb 
on october   the loan and security agreement  which governs our revolving credit facility  was amended 
under the amended loan and security agreement  our revolving credit facility s maximum borrowing availability was increased to million from million  its maturity date was extended to december  from october   the variable rate at which borrowings bear interest was reduced to prime rate plus basis points from prime rate plus basis points and the company s minimum tangible net worth requirement was reset at million such minimum requirement still continuing to be subject to increase by i of quarterly net profits and ii of the net proceeds received from issuances of equity and issuances of subordinated debt 
the maximum that we could borrow at any given time is based on among other things  eligible accounts receivable  inventory  and cash 
we are subject to substantially the same customary borrowing terms and conditions under the svb credit facility as we were prior to amending the loan and security agreement  including the accuracy of representations and warranties  compliance with financial maintenance and restrictive covenants and the absence of events of default 
the foregoing description of our svb credit facility and the amended loan and security agreement is qualified by reference to note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we were in compliance with all covenants under the amended loan and security agreement  as of december  and the date of this report 
as of december  and the date of this report  borrowings outstanding under the svb credit facility totaled million and  as of the date of this report  we had approximately million of additional borrowing availability 
our cash balance at december  was approximately million 
we believe these funds combined with anticipated cash generated from operations and borrowing availability under our credit facility with svb are sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
however  although we believe that we have sufficient sources of liquidity  the current financial and economic conditions could limit our access to credit and impair our ability to raise capital  if needed  on acceptable terms or at all 
we also face other risks that could impact our business  liquidity and financial condition 
for a description of these risks  see item a

off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued accounting standard update asu which amended the accounting requirements under the software topic  asc revenue recognition 
the objective of this update is to address the accounting for revenue arrangements that contain tangible products and software 
specifically  products that contain software that is more than incidental to the product as a whole will be removed from the scope of accounting standard codification asc subtopic previously aicpa statement of position 
the amendments align the accounting for these revenue transaction types with the amendments under asu the guidance provided within asu is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  and allows for either prospective or retrospective application  with early adoption permitted 
the company s adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued asu  revenue recognition multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu updates the existing multiple element revenue arrangements guidance currently included in asc the revised guidance provides for two significant changes to the existing multiple element revenue arrangements guidance 
the first change relates to the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting 
this change will result in the requirement to separate more deliverables within an arrangement  ultimately leading to less revenue deferral 
the second change modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables 
together  these changes will result in earlier recognition of revenue and related costs for multiple element arrangements than under previous guidance 
this guidance expands the disclosures required for multiple element revenue arrangements and is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after june  the company adopted this guidance in in january  the fasb issued asu  which requires new fair value disclosures pertaining to significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and the reasons for the transfers and activity 
for level fair value measurements  purchases  sales  issuances and settlements must be reported on a gross basis 
further  additional disclosures are required by class of assets or liabilities  as well as inputs used to measure fair value and valuation techniques 
asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross basis  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company s adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued asu  which amends subsequent event disclosure requirements for sec filers 
an entity that is an sec filer is not required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated 
this asu was effective upon issuance and the company s adoption of this asu did not result in a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates in response to the sec s financial reporting release  fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have selected for discussion our revenue recognition process and our more subjective accounting estimation processes 
these processes affect our reported revenues and current assets and are therefore critical in assessing the financial and operating status of relm 
the processes for determining the allowance for collection of trade receivables  reserves for excess or obsolete inventory  software development and income taxes  involve certain assumptions that if incorrect could create an adverse impact on relm operations and financial position 
revenue sales revenue is recognized when the earnings process is complete and collection is reasonably assured 
the earnings process is generally complete when the product is shipped by the company or delivered to the customer  depending upon whether the title to the goods  as well as the risks and benefits of ownership are transferred to the customer at point of shipment or point of delivery 
however  sales to the federal government are recognized when the products are delivered 
for extended warranties  sales revenue associated with the warranty is deferred at the time of sale and later recognized on a straight line basis over the extended warranty period 
we periodically review our revenue recognition procedures to assure that such procedures are in accordance with asc topic revenue recognition 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately  on gross trade receivables of their approximately million as of december  this allowance is used to state trade receivables at a net realizable value or the amount that we estimate will be collected on our gross receivables as of december  because the amount that we will actually collect on the receivables outstanding as of december  cannot be known with certainty as of this report s date  we rely on prior experience 
our historical collection losses have typically been infrequent with write offs of trade receivables being less than of sales during past years 
accordingly  we have maintained a general allowance up to approximately of the gross trade receivables balance in order to allow for future collection losses that arise from customer accounts that do not indicate the inability to pay but turn out to have such an inability 
currently  our general allowance on trade receivables is approximately of gross receivables 
as revenues and total receivables increase  the allowance balance may also increase 
we also maintain a specific allowance for customer accounts that we know may not be collectible due to various reasons such as bankruptcy and other customer liquidity issues 
we analyze our trade receivable portfolio based on the age of each customer s invoice 
in this way  we can identify those accounts that are more likely than not to have collection problems 
we may reserve a portion or all of the customer s balance 
excess and obsolete inventory the allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory was approximately million at december  as compared to approximately million at december  the reserve for slow moving  excess  or obsolete inventory is used to state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
because the amount of inventory that we will actually recoup through sales cannot be known with certainty at any particular time  we rely on past sales experience  future sales forecasts  and our strategic business plans 
generally  in analyzing our inventory levels  we classify inventory as having been used or unused during the past year and establish a reserve based upon several factors  including  but not limited to  business forecasts  inventory quantities and historic usage profile 
supplemental to the aforementioned analysis  specific inventory items are reviewed individually by management 
based on the review  considering business levels  future prospects  new products and technology changes  the valuation of specific inventory items may be adjusted to reflect an accurate valuation  in the business judgment of management 
management also performs a determination of net realizable value for all finished goods with a selling price below cost 
for all such items  the inventory is valued at not more than the selling price 
software development we account for the costs of software within its products in accordance with asc topic costs of software to be sold  leased or marketed  under which certain software costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility are capitalized and amortized over the estimated lives of the related products 
we determine technological feasibility to be established upon the internal release of a detailed program design as specified by topic upon the general release of the product to customers  development costs for that product are amortized over periods not exceeding five years  based on current and future revenue of the product 
net capitalized software costs totaled approximately million as of december  income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method specified by asc topic  income taxes  as modified by asc topic deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the period in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized 
the effect of changes in net deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized on the our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the change is recognized 
valuation allowances are provided to the extent that impairment of tax assets are more likely than not 
in determining whether a tax asset is realizable  we consider among other things  estimates of future earnings based on information currently available  current and anticipated customers  contracts and new product introductions  as well as recent operating results and certain tax planning strategies 
if we fail to achieve the future results anticipated in the calculation and valuation of net deferred tax assets  we may be required to adjust the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets in the future 
forward looking statements we believe that it is important to communicate our future expectations to our security holders and to the public 
this report  therefore  contains statements about future events and expectations which are forward looking statements within the meaning of sections a of the securities act of and e of the securities exchange act of  including the statements about our plans  objectives  expectations and prospects under the heading management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

any statement contained in this report that is not a statement of historical fact may be deemed to be a forward looking statement 
although we believe that the plans  objectives  expectations and prospects reflected in or suggested by our forward looking statements are reasonable  those statements involve risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results  performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward looking statements  and we can give no assurance that our plans  objectives  expectations and prospects will be achieved 
important factors that might cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements are contained in item a

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we may be subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the ordinary course of business for borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which bear interest at a variable rate 
the lender presently charges interest at the prime rate plus basis points 
as of december   we had million in outstanding borrowings under this facility bearing interest at per annum 
interest rate changes on variable debt impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net market value of the debt instrument 
based on our variable rate debt as of december   it is estimated that a basis point increase in interest rates on our revolving line of credit would result in an additional  in interest incurred per year on its line of credit and a basis point decline would lower interest incurred by  per year
