item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical consolidated financial information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 
see the safe harbor cautionary statement above for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
overview we design  develop  market  sell and support powerful yet easy to use enterprise it infrastructure management software to it professionals in organizations of all sizes 
our offerings range from individual software tools to more comprehensive software products that solve problems faced every day by it professionals and help to enable efficient and effective management of their infrastructure  including networks  applications  storage and physical and virtual servers 
all of our products are ready to use  featuring intuitive and easily customized user interfaces and built in workflows 
our products can be downloaded directly from our websites and installed and configured by our end users in a matter of hours 
our customers include small and mid size businesses  enterprises  and local  state and federal government entities that have purchased our products 
since our founding we have provided tools for network engineers and software for managing enterprise networks  and we are a leading provider of network management software 
in  with the launch of orion application performance manager  we began to offer solutions for managing applications and servers 
in january  in response to changes in the technology environment and to meet the needs of our customers  we acquired certain assets of tek tools  inc  or tek tools  expanding the range of elements of it infrastructure that our products monitor and manage to include storage and virtualized servers 
in january  we entered into the application performance and virtualization management markets through the launch of solarwinds application performance monitor and the acquisition of hyper  inc  or hyper  a privately held virtualization management software provider based in austin  texas 
we anticipate continuing to make selective acquisitions of companies with products that complement our business model 
as a core part of our strategy  we employ a highly efficient product development process  a scalable marketing model and a high volume  transaction oriented inside sales model that have allowed us to drive and support rapid growth in our business at high operating margins while offering our products at prices that are typically significantly lower than competing frameworks 
our trailing month average transaction size for new license sales  excluding our kiwi syslog server and kiwi cattools products  during  and was less than  we manage our business with a culture and systems that are focused on metrics  helping us to achieve consistency in our execution 
to increase our international sales  we have expanded international operations by building a direct inside sales force and building a network of resellers in selected international markets 
we established operations in cork  ireland in to serve as our europe  middle east and african  or emea  sales and support center as well as our international headquarters 
we have since opened a sales and support operation in singapore  established a research and development facility in the czech republic  acquired research and development personnel in new zealand and india and  most recently  began operations in brisbane  australia to serve as our asia pacific headquarters 
we anticipate continuing our international expansion to further market  sell and develop our products 
in  we will continue to focus on the significant growth opportunities in the it infrastructure management market while expanding our customer base and brand awareness in the application  storage resource and virtualization management markets 
we believe our market penetration is low in all geographic and end user 
table of contents markets in which we sell products 
in the new markets we have entered  we will continue our strategy of delivering powerful  easy to use and affordable software along with leveraging the web as the primary method to reach potential customers 
key financial highlights key financial highlights for include the following total revenue was million for compared to million in operating income was million for compared to million in  net income was million for compared to million in  and net income was per share on a fully diluted basis for compared to per share on a fully diluted basis in key business metrics we review a number of key business metrics to help us monitor the performance of our business model and to identify trends affecting our business 
the measures that we believe are the primary indicators of our quarterly and annual performance are as follows average transaction size for new license sales 
we focus our sales  marketing and research and development efforts on it professionals in organizations of all sizes  with the goal of driving purchases of our software by these it professionals in very short sales cycles with minimal levels of approval 
in addition  many of our customers make small initial purchases of our software to manage specific components of their networks and then make additional purchases over time to expand the use of the product that they purchased or to buy additional software products from us 
we measure the average transaction size for new license sales on a frequent basis as an indicator of the success of these efforts and to ensure the effectiveness of our marketing and sales model 
we define a transaction as each invoice issued for the sale of one or more of our products 
we exclude our kiwi syslog server and kiwi cattools products from our calculation of average transaction size for new license sales because these products sell at a much lower price point than our core products  defined as transactions that include orion  an orion module or our profiler products 
despite representing a small portion of our revenue  including these kiwi products would have a significant impact on the average transaction size for new license sales in those periods in which we sold the products 
by excluding our kiwi products  we believe that management can better evaluate our core business without the variations imposed by the kiwi products 
since the average transaction size for new license sales will fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of a different mix of business and product sales  especially our us federal government business  we also review the average transaction size for new license sales on a trailing month basis to eliminate the quarterly variability in our transaction mix 
non gaap operating income 
our management uses non gaap operating income to measure our performance 
because non gaap operating income excludes certain non cash expenses such as amortization  stock based compensation and certain expenses that may not be indicative of our core business  we believe that this measure provides us with additional useful information to measure and understand our performance on a consistent basis  particularly with respect to changes in performance from period to period 
we use non gaap operating income in the preparation of our budgets and to measure and monitor our performance 
non gaap operating income is not determined in accordance with gaap and is not a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures determined in accordance with gaap 
for further discussion regarding non gaap operating income and a reconciliation of non gaap operating income to operating income  see the discussion under the caption non gaap financial measures included elsewhere in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report 

table of contents revenue growth 
we have employed a differentiated business model for marketing and selling high volumes of enterprise class software  which is focused on rapid revenue growth at high operating margins 
we regularly review our total revenue growth to measure our success 
we have built a pricing model for our products that aims to maximize our recurring revenue and the value of a customer over time and not upfront license revenue 
this is an important component of our financial model 
this model is based on the premise that we will be able to deliver ongoing value to our customers and maintain a long term financial relationship with the users of our core enterprise class network and it management products 
opportunities and trends businesses  governments and other organizations are increasingly relying on data networks and it infrastructures to execute their operations  facilitate their internal and external communications and transact business with their customers and partners 
the size of these networks  the number of applications and servers  and the complexity of physical and virtual server environments are increasing as organizations place more reliance on them 
we believe that the increasing challenges of it infrastructure management and the limitations of existing offerings present a market opportunity for our products 
in addition to the network management products that we have offered since  we also offer products that we have developed or acquired that manage servers and applications and monitor and manage storage and virtualized servers 
we believe that these products allow us to compete effectively in the adjacent markets of application management  storage resource management and virtual server management 
we expect our revenue to continue to grow as we capitalize on these and other market opportunities 
we expect our trailing month average transaction size for new license sales to increase in the to range over the next several quarters as we anticipate increasing our sales to enterprise customers who tend to enter into larger transactions and continue to pursue our strategy of offering stand alone products as well as attaching more modules to the sales of our flagship product  orion network performance monitor 
in addition  sales of the storage and virtualization products we acquired from tek tools and hyper may also contribute to this growth as the average transaction size for new license sales on these products is currently higher than our orion family of products 
recent statistics indicate that the united states and certain international economies are showing some signs of stabilization 
a larger number of current and potential customers seem to be more confident in making purchases of it software and we expect that confidence to continue into the future and we hope to capitalize on this opportunity 
however  we believe there remains significant uncertainty regarding the extent and timing of an economic recovery in certain geographic regions 
in these regions  we believe that difficult economic conditions offer us an opportunity to market and sell our products to mid size businesses and enterprise customers at compelling prices compared to the prices of many competing products 
we expect the us federal government to continue to be a significant market opportunity as we believe the ease of deployment  power and scalability of our products give us an enhanced opportunity to sell to various agencies and departments of the us federal government 
we continue to expect inconsistency in the buying pattern of the us federal government for larger transactions with our products 
in addition  our sales to the us federal government are largely dependent on systems integrators  distributors and resellers whose purchases from us have been difficult to predict 
we may  therefore  be unable to predict accurately when and if the purchase orders from the us federal government will be received 
key components of our results of operations sources of revenue our revenue is primarily comprised of license and maintenance revenue 
we license our software under perpetual licenses  which ordinarily includes one year of maintenance as part of the initial purchase price of the product 
license revenue reflects the revenue recognized from sales of new licenses and upgrades to our software 
we have experienced annual and quarterly growth in license revenue 
customers can renew  and 
table of contents generally have renewed  their maintenance agreements for annual periods at our standard list maintenance renewal pricing for their software products 
current customers with maintenance agreements are entitled to receive unspecified upgrades or enhancements when and if they become available 
maintenance revenue is an important source of our future revenue 
we have experienced strong and consistent annual and quarterly growth in maintenance and other revenue 
because our maintenance base grew during  and due to new license sales and high customer retention  we expect maintenance revenue to continue to increase in future periods 
cost of revenue cost of revenue primarily consists of personnel costs related to providing technical support services and amortization of acquired developed product technologies 
personnel costs include salaries  bonuses and stock based compensation and related employer paid payroll taxes for technical support personnel  as well as an allocation of our facilities  information technology and other overhead costs and our employee benefit costs 
we allocate stock based compensation expense and related employer paid payroll taxes to personnel costs based on the expense category in which the option holder works 
we allocate overhead  such as rent  computer and other technology costs  and employee benefit costs to personnel costs in each expense category based on worldwide headcount in that category 
we expect our cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars but to remain relatively stable as a percentage of revenue in future periods 
operating expenses we classify our operating expenses into three categories sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative 
our operating expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  contract research and development costs  marketing program costs and legal  accounting  consulting and other professional service fees 
personnel costs for each category of operating expenses include salaries  bonuses and stock based compensation and related employer paid payroll taxes for personnel in that category  as well as an allocation of our facilities  information technology and other overhead costs and our employee benefit costs 
we allocate stock based compensation expense resulting from the amortization of the fair value of options granted based on how we categorize the department in which the optionholder works 
we allocate overhead  such as rent  computer and other technology costs and employee benefit costs  to each expense category based on worldwide headcount in that category 
our operating expenses increased as a percentage of revenue and in absolute dollars in each of and as we have continued to build infrastructure and add employees through acquisitions and internal growth across all departments in order to accelerate and support our growth and to expand into international markets 
the number of employees increased from in to in and in in  our operating expenses increased in absolute dollars and decreased as a percentage of revenue as we continue to make investments in our business by expanding our direct inside sales force domestically and internationally  increasing our marketing operations and programs and adding research and development personnel worldwide 
we expect our operating expenses in future periods to continue to increase in absolute dollars and to be higher as a percentage of revenue if we acquire additional companies and as we integrate the businesses 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel costs for our sales  marketing and business development employees and executives  commissions earned by our sales personnel  the cost of marketing programs such as paid search  search engine optimization and management  trade shows  webinars and the cost of business development programs 
we expect to continue to hire sales personnel in the united states and in our international sales offices 
research and development 
research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel costs for our product development employees and executives and fees to our contract development vendors in eastern 
table of contents europe 
we have devoted our development efforts primarily to expanding our product line  increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our software products 
in  we opened a development center in the czech republic to take advantage of low labor rates and strong technical talent 
we also acquired research and development personnel in new zealand and india as part of our acquisitions 
since establishing our research and development center in the czech republic and as a result of our acquisitions  we have significantly increased our research and development employee headcount and relied less on our eastern european contract development vendors for research and development personnel 
we expect to continue to invest in our research and development activities by hiring engineers in the us and in our international locations 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs for our executive  finance  legal  human resources and administrative personnel  as well as legal  accounting and other professional service fees and other corporate expenses 
our general and administrative expenses were higher in than as we incurred lawsuit settlement costs and related legal fees and additional costs related to a public offering completed in the fourth quarter of we expect to incur additional costs in future periods as our business continues to grow both organically and through acquisitions 
in addition  we intend to continue to grant equity awards which would result in additional stock based compensation expense 
other income expense other income expense primarily consists of interest income  interest expense  foreign exchange gains losses  government grant income and acquisition related contingent consideration fair value adjustments 
interest income represents interest received on our cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense was associated with our outstanding long term debt  the outstanding principal of which was million on december  and was paid in full on may  the amortization and write off of debt issuance costs of million  million and million were included in interest expense for the years ended december   and  respectively 
foreign exchange gains losses relate to expenses and billing transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the associated company 
government grant income is related to grants received by our irish and czech republic entities for the creation of job positions and related training costs 
acquisition related contingent consideration fair value adjustments are related to the change in fair value due to the passage of time 
income tax expense income tax expense primarily consists of corporate income taxes related to profits resulting from the sale of our software offerings by our united states and irish entities 
we expect our income tax expense to increase in absolute dollars as our profits continue to increase  however  we expect our effective tax rate to decline slowly  due to the lower corporate tax rate in ireland  as our international earnings increase as a percentage of total earnings 
we benefit from the tax credit incentives under the us research and experimentation tax credit extended to taxpayers engaged in qualified research and experimental activities while carrying on a trade or business 
the tax credit is currently set to expire on december   and if not renewed under similar terms as in prior years  the result could have a material impact on our financial results 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in many instances  we could reasonably use different accounting estimates  and in some instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ 
table of contents significantly from the estimates made by our management 
to the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will be affected 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application  while in other cases  management s judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting standards that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions 
we believe that these accounting policies requiring significant management judgment are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
these critical accounting policies are valuation of goodwill  intangibles  long lived assets and contingent consideration  revenue recognition  stock based compensation  and income taxes 
valuation of goodwill  intangibles  long lived assets and contingent consideration when we acquire businesses  we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill 
we must also estimate the fair value of contingent consideration 
the allocation of the purchase price and valuation of contingent consideration requires management to make significant estimates in determining fair values  especially with respect to intangible assets and contingent consideration 
these estimates are based on historical experience  information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and relevant market and industry data 
these estimates can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future  the appropriate discount rate  the useful lives of intangible assets and probabilities of achievement of financial targets under contingent consideration arrangements 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur  which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
we test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each year in accordance with the authoritative guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets 
additionally  we test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the interim if events and circumstances indicate that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives may be impaired 
the events and circumstances that we consider include the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators and competition 
we evaluate impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives using a two step process 
the first step involves a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the process involves a comparison of the fair value and carrying amount of the goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives of that reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  we would recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value 
if an event occurs that would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  the revision could result in a non cash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial results 
long lived assets and finite lived intangibles 
we evaluate long lived assets and finite lived intangibles held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their net book values may not be recoverable 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate 
table of contents the balance of our property and equipment and finite lived intangible assets may not be recoverable 
this evaluation is significantly impacted by estimates and assumptions of future revenue  expenses and other factors  which are affected by changes in the business climate  legal matters and competition 
if an event occurs that would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our property and equipment or our finite lived intangible assets  that revision could result in a non cash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial results 
when these factors and circumstances exist  we compare the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts 
we base the impairment  if any  on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value  based on market value when available  or discounted expected cash flows of those assets  and record it in the period in which we make the determination 
contingent consideration 
our acquisitions may include contingent consideration payments based on future sales or product milestones of an acquired company 
we make estimates regarding the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities at the acquisition date and at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved 
we estimate the fair value of these liabilities based on financial projection of the acquired companies and estimated probabilities of achievement 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  there is significant judgment involved 
changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities subsequent to the acquisition are recorded in other income expense in our consolidated statement of income and could cause a material impact to our operating results 
revenue recognition we derive substantially all of our revenue from the licensing of our software products and from the sale of maintenance agreements 
we typically include one year of maintenance as part of the initial purchase price of each software offering and then sell annual renewals of this maintenance agreement 
in accordance with current guidance  we recognize revenue for software  maintenance and other services when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable 
license revenue 
we consider delivery of our software to have occurred and recognize revenue from the sale of perpetual licenses to our software when risk of loss transfers to the customer or reseller  which is generally upon electronic transfer of the license key that provides immediate availability of the product to the purchaser 
we sell licenses to our software products through our direct inside sales force and through our distributors and other resellers 
our distributors do not carry inventory of our software  we generally require resellers to specify the end user of the software at the time of the order 
if the reseller does not provide end user information  then we will generally not fulfill the order 
our distributors and resellers have no rights of return or exchange for software that they purchase from us and payment for these purchases is due to us without regard to whether the distributors or resellers collect payment from their customers 
we generally use a purchase order  an authorized credit card  an electronic or manually signed license agreement  or the receipt of a cash payment as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through resellers are typically evidenced by a reseller agreement  together with purchase orders or authorized credit cards on a transaction by transaction basis 
we account for sales incentives to customers or resellers as a reduction of revenue at the time we recognize the revenue from the related product sale 
we report revenue net of any sales tax collected 
our return policy generally does not allow our customers to return software offerings 
because our software is generally sold with maintenance  we calculate the amount of revenue allocated to the software license by determining the fair value of the maintenance and subtracting it from the total invoice or 
table of contents contract amount 
we establish vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of the fair value of maintenance services by the standard published list pricing for our maintenance renewals since we generally charge list prices for our maintenance renewals 
maintenance and other revenue 
we derive maintenance revenue from fees for software maintenance services 
we recognize maintenance revenue ratably on a daily basis over the contract period 
customers with maintenance agreements are entitled to receive unspecified upgrades or enhancements to new versions of their software products on a when and if available basis 
other revenue consists of training  consulting and product development services  which is recognized upon delivery of the training or consulting services to the end customer or when the development work is performed 
other revenue is not currently significant nor do we expect it to be significant in future periods 
stock based compensation we have granted our employees and directors stock based incentive awards 
these awards are in the form of stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units 
we measure stock based compensation expense for all share based awards granted based on the estimated fair value of those awards on the date of grant 
the fair values of stock option awards are estimated using a black scholes valuation model 
the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards is determined using the fair market value of our common stock based on the quoted market price on the date of grant 
stock based compensation reduced income before income taxes by million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the income tax benefit related to stock based compensation was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in june  our former executive chairman retired and entered into a severance agreement and release which provided for  among other things  an acceleration of the vesting of certain options  resulting in an additional one time stock based compensation expense of million 
the income tax benefit related to this additional one time stock based compensation expense was million 
an excess tax benefit arises when the tax deduction related to a stock option award is greater than the award s original grant date fair value pursuant to the authoritative guidance 
for financial reporting purposes  this excess tax benefit is not recorded as a tax benefit in our consolidated statements of income and is instead treated as additional paid in capital in our consolidated balance sheets 
tax benefits and excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock option awards were as follows year ended december  in thousands tax benefit from the exercise of stock option awards excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock option awards these excess tax benefits are a reduction to our cash payments related to income taxes and must be reported as cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
income taxes we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in the authoritative guidance for accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the respective carrying amounts and tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
the guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
at december  and  we had million and million of unrecognized tax benefits  respectively  all of which  if recognized  would affect our effective tax rate 

table of contents we accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
as of december  and  there was an insignificant amount accrued for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits 
in calculating our effective tax rate  we make judgments regarding certain tax positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions 
this guidance requires us to identify  evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of these positions that may not be sustained  or may only partially be sustained  upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities 
although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable  actual results may differ from these estimates 
some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities 
we establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the need for  and the adequacy of  valuation allowances based on the expected realization of our deferred tax assets 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include our latest forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
we intend either to invest our non us earnings permanently in foreign operations or to remit these earnings to our us entities in a tax free manner 
for this reason  we do not record federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries

table of contents revenue revenue was million in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase was comprised of a million increase in maintenance and other revenue  which resulted from a continued growing maintenance base due to new sales  new customers through acquisitions and high customer retention  and a million increase in license revenue due to an increase in sales transaction volumes of our core enterprise class network and it management products and a increase in our trailing month average transaction size for new license sales 
through the year ended december   the trailing month average transaction size for new license sales was approximately  as compared to approximately  for the month period through the year ended december  we believe that the increase in new license sales and our average transaction size for new license sales resulted from better awareness of our products  an increase in the number of products that we sell primarily as a result of our product development and our acquisitions 
new license sales in our commercial business increased globally while new license sales in our us federal government business decreased in compared to the decline in us federal sales was primarily driven by a reduction in the value of orders received from agencies and groups associated with the department of defense 
our revenue from our foreign subsidiaries was and of total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively

the decrease was also offset by an increase in other costs such as consulting  director fees  severance costs related to the retirement of our former executive chairman  employee meetings and other miscellaneous administrative and employee expenses 
the increase in stock based compensation expense of million included a one time expense of million from the acceleration of the vesting of certain options related to the retirement of our former executive chairman on june  other income expense interest expense in decreased by million from due to principal payments made in and the outstanding principal balance under our indebtedness  which was comprised of a first lien note and a second lien note  was as follows at december  in thousands outstanding debt balance our outstanding principal balance on the notes was million as of december  in march  we prepaid million of principal to repay all of the outstanding principal balance on the first lien note

these increases were offset by a million decrease in management fees and a million decrease in bad debt expense from to other income expense interest expense in decreased by million from due to a lower amount of outstanding indebtedness because of our principal prepayments in  a lower effective interest rate on our outstanding debt and a million fee  paid to our lenders in march as consideration for an amendment to our credit agreements  that was treated as an additional interest expense 
in march  we prepaid million of principal pursuant to our first lien credit agreement 
these decreases were offset by a million write off of debt issuance costs included in interest expense for associated with the mandatory repayment of million of principal with the net proceeds of our ipo in may  reducing our principal balance on our outstanding debt to million as of december  pursuant to the terms of our former credit agreements  our interest rate was reset periodically 
our effective interest rate in was 
our effective interest rate in  excluding the million write off of debt issuance costs  was 
the outstanding principal balance under our indebtedness was as follows at december  in thousands outstanding debt balance income tax expense our income tax expense in decreased by million from and our effective tax rate decreased from in to in our effective tax rate decreased primarily as a result of an increase in research and development tax credits generated in the united states and an increase in the percentage of our earnings that are generated by our international operations  which are generally taxed at lower corporate tax rates than in the united states 

table of contents non gaap financial measures we believe non gaap financial measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons non gaap financial measures are widely used by investors to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items  such as interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation and related employer paid payroll taxes  that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing and accounting methods  the book value of their assets  their capital structures and the method by which their assets were acquired and certain expenses and expenditures  such as lawsuit settlement costs and related legal fees  that may not be indicative of a company s core business operations  securities analysts use non gaap financial measures as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies  and by comparing our non gaap financial measures in different historical periods  our investors can evaluate our operating results without the additional variations of stock based compensation expense  which is a non cash expense that is not a key measure of our operations 
our management uses non gaap financial measures as a measure of operating performance  because it does not include the impact of items not directly resulting from our core operations  for planning purposes  including the preparation of our annual operating budget  to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business  to determine employee incentive compensation  to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies  and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance 
we understand that  although non gaap financial measures are frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluation of companies  non gaap financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool 
non gaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap  do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting and may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation between companies 
certain items that are excluded from non gaap financial measures  such as the amortization of intangible assets  stock based compensation expense and related employer paid payroll taxes and acquisition related costs  can have a material impact on net earnings 
as a result  you should not consider non gaap financial measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported under gaap 

table of contents we have provided reconciliations of the non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures below 
non gaap operating income we define non gaap operating income as gaap operating income plus stock based compensation expense and related employer paid payroll taxes  amortization of intangible assets  lawsuit settlement costs and related legal fees  public offering costs  certain acquisition related costs and severance costs related to the retirement of our former executive chairman 
the table below provides a reconciliation of non gaap operating income to gaap operating income 
year ended december  in thousands gaap operating income stock based compensation expense and related employer paid payroll taxes amortization of intangible assets lawsuit settlement costs and related legal fees reimbursements public offering costs acquisition related costs severance costs related to retirement of former executive chairman non gaap operating income non gaap net income we define non gaap net income as gaap net income excluding those items excluded above in the calculation of non gaap operating income  the write off of debt issuance costs  fair value adjustments related to contingent consideration included in acquisition related costs and the tax benefits associated with the excluded items 
year ended december  in thousands gaap net income stock based compensation expense and related employer paid payroll taxes amortization of intangible assets lawsuit settlement costs and related legal fees reimbursements public offering costs acquisition related costs severance costs related to retirement of former executive chairman debt issuance costs write off tax benefits associated with above adjustments non gaap net income 
table of contents non gaap earnings per share non gaap diluted earnings per share is equal to non gaap net income divided by non gaap weighted average shares outstanding  which adjusts gaap weighted average shares outstanding for the years ended december  and to assume the conversion of our preferred stock in may occurred as of the beginning of the indicated period 
year ended december  in thousands numerator non gaap net income denominator reconciliation between gaap and non gaap weighted average shares used in computing diluted earnings per share weighted average number of shares used in computing diluted earnings per share pro forma adjustments to reflect assumed weighted average effect of conversion of preferred stock a non gaap weighted average shares used in computing non gaap diluted earnings per share b diluted earnings per share non gaap diluted earnings per share a represents common shares from the conversion of convertible preferred shares as if the shares were converted as of the beginning of the indicated period 
b if the company assumed the common shares issued in its initial public offering in may were issued as of the beginning of the comparable period  or january   then the weighted average shares used in computing non gaap diluted earnings per share and the non gaap diluted earnings per share would have been  shares and per share  respectively  and  shares and per share  respectively  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
free cash flow we define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities plus excess tax benefit from stock based compensation less purchases of property and equipment 
we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides important information to management  investors and security analysts regarding the cash generated by the business after the purchase of property and equipment that can then be used for  among other things  strategic acquisitions and investments  share repurchases and ongoing operations 
free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period 
the table below presents a reconciliation of free cash flow to gaap cash flows from operating activities 
year ended december  in thousands gaap cash flows from operating activities excess tax benefit from stock based compensation purchases of property and equipment free cash flow the increase in free cash flow from to and to is primarily due to the increase in operating income that converted to cash flow  tax benefits associated with the unusually large number of option exercises due to the ipo in and executive exercises in 
table of contents acquisitions in december  we acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of trilenium for million in cash 
in january  we acquired certain assets from tek tools for an aggregate purchase price of million  consisting of cash and shares of our common stock 
we have included the operating results of these acquisitions in our consolidated results from the effective date of each acquisition 
we accounted for each of those acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
in each case  we allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired  including intangible assets  and liabilities assumed  based on estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition 
we derived the value of intangible assets of million for the trilenium acquisition and million for the tek tools acquisition from the present value of estimated future benefits from the various intangible assets acquired 
at the time of the acquisitions  we recorded goodwill of million for the trilenium acquisition and million for the tek tools acquisition  representing in each case the excess of the purchase price over the aggregate fair values of the net identifiable assets acquired 
in  the trilenium acquisition goodwill decreased by million based on the final valuation offset by additional direct acquisition costs 
in  the goodwill associated with the tek tools acquisition decreased by million due to exchange rate fluctuations upon consolidation of goodwill recorded in our foreign subsidiaries 
in january  we acquired hyper for approximately million in cash 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources the following table presents our key measures of liquidity for the years ended december  and year ended december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents end of period accounts receivable  net working capital net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities cash and cash equivalents at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital 
our available cash and cash equivalents are held in bank deposits and money market funds 
our money market mutual funds invest in high quality  short term securities  many of which are issued or guaranteed by the us government or by us government agencies 
we also hold a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in bank deposits located in ireland that are fully guaranteed by the irish government 
we actively monitor the third party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents 
our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal while secondarily maximizing yield on those funds 
the balances held in the united states may exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation  or fdic  insurance limits or may not be insured by the fdic 
while we monitor the balances in our accounts and adjust the balances as appropriate  these balances could be impacted if the underlying depository institutions or the guarantors fail or could be subject to adverse conditions in the financial markets 
we strive to maintain our cash deposits and invest our money market funds with multiple financial institutions of reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk 
to date  we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our invested cash and cash equivalents  however  we can provide no assurances that access to our funds will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 

table of contents accounts receivable  net our accounts receivable balance fluctuates from period to period  which affects our cash flow from operating activities 
the fluctuations vary depending on the timing of our sales  cash collections and changes to our allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable represent trade receivables from customers when we have provided software licenses and or annual software maintenance agreements and we have not yet received payment 
we have historically had insignificant write offs related to bad debts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million at december  and million at december  we use days sales outstanding  or dso  calculated on a quarterly basis  as a measurement of the quality and status of our receivables 
we define dso as a accounts receivable divided by b total revenue for the most recent quarter  multiplied by c the number of days in the quarter 
our dso was days at december  operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we had a net non cash benefit of million in and incurred net non cash expenses of million and million in and  respectively 
non cash benefits or expenses primarily consisted of stock based compensation expense of million  million and million  excess tax benefits related to employee stock option exercises of million  million and  and depreciation and amortization expense of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in addition  non cash expenses in included million of expenses paid by a stockholder in connection with the settlement of our lawsuit with a former employee 
the change in certain assets and liabilities resulted in a net source of cash of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities is driven by sales of our software offerings and maintenance renewals 
collection of accounts receivable from the sales of our software offerings and maintenance renewals is a significant component of our cash flows from operating activities  as is the change in deferred revenue related to these sales 
changes in our income tax receivable and payable balances are also significant components of our cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was increased by a us federal income tax refund of million in and reduced by income tax payments of million and million in and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities was reduced by interest payments of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities was also reduced in by million in legal fees and settlement expenses  net of insurance reimbursements  paid by us in connection with the settlement of our lawsuit with a former employee 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities in was primarily due to the million of cash used in our purchase of certain assets of tek tools and million of purchases of property and equipment for operations 
cash used in investing activities in was primarily for purchase of software licenses and tools  computers and equipment  furniture and fixtures as we expanded our infrastructure and workforce 
in  we acquired certain assets and liabilities of trilenium for an aggregate of million in cash 
we also incurred additional costs primarily consisting of payments in an aggregate amount of million upon the achievement of certain performance criteria related to the neon acquisition in and costs associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters and opening of our czech republic development center 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million in net cash provided by financing activities was million in net cash used in financing activities was million in net cash used in financing activities in was due to a million repayment of long term debt partially offset by 
table of contents million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and a million excess tax benefit related to stock based compensation 
this excess tax benefit is a reduction in cash payments for us federal income taxes due to tax deductions related to stock option exercises 
the debt payments in paid off our entire outstanding principal under our first lien note and second lien note 
on august   our board of directors approved a share repurchase program  authorizing us to purchase up to million of our outstanding common stock 
the share repurchase program was completed in august  and we repurchased and retired million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the repurchase was authorized to reflect the confidence of management and the board of directors in our business 
we believed the share repurchase program would generate a positive return to our shareholders by reducing the number of shares outstanding 
given the low rates of return on cash and short term investments and as there was no outstanding debt at the time of the share repurchase  we believed the share repurchase program was a proper use of our available cash 
net cash provided by financing activities in was due to the net cash proceeds from our ipo of million  after deducting underwriter discounts and commissions but before other offering costs  million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and the excess tax benefit related to employee stock option exercises of million 
we made a one time earnout payment pursuant to an agreement with our original stockholders of million in november this million payment  which was treated as a dividend payment pursuant to applicable accounting rules  was reflected in our consolidated statements of changes in convertible preferred stock and stockholders equity deficit as a reduction of additional paid in capital 
in march  we repurchased  shares of our common stock and  shares of our preferred stock from our lender and certain of its affiliated entities for an aggregate purchase price of million  or per share 
we then sold  shares of our common stock and  shares of our preferred stock to the rest of our stockholders based on their pro rata ownership of our common and preferred stock for per share  which resulted in total proceeds to us of million 
anticipated cash flows we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditures for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion into new territories  the timing of introductions of new software products and enhancements to existing software products  and the continuing market acceptance of our software offerings 
although we are not currently a party to any agreement or letter of intent regarding potential investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  applications or technologies  we may enter into these types of arrangements  which could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
capital expenditures we estimate our capital expenditures for to be approximately million  comprised primarily of additional leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures and computer equipment 
acquisition related costs in january  we acquired hyper for approximately million in cash and contingent consideration up to million 
the fair value of the contingent consideration will be recorded in our consolidated balance sheet at march  as an accrued earnout 
the accrued earnout is based on sales milestones and could range from to million 
the accrued earnout will be paid in the first quarter of the acquisition was financed with cash flows from operations 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments we generally do not enter into long term minimum purchase commitments 
our principal commitments as of december   consisted of obligations under facility leases for office space in austin  texas  tulsa  oklahoma  dallas  texas  herndon  virginia  the republic of ireland  new zealand  singapore  india  australia  and the czech republic 
the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of december   that require us to make future cash payments payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating leases purchase obligations accrued earnout total purchase obligations represent purchases of software license and support fees  marketing activities  accounting fees  corporate health insurance costs and computer hardware and software 
we entered into an agreement to purchase certain assets of tek tools in january the purchase agreement included two earnout payments as follows i up to million of cash to be paid upon the achievement of sales milestones for and ii up to million of cash to be paid upon the receipt of certain third party consents 
the payments are recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet at december  as an accrued acquisition earnout of million 
the million earnout was paid in february in january  we acquired hyper for approximately million of cash plus or minus the closing working capital amount as calculated from the closing balance sheet 
in addition to the purchase price  an earnout payment ranging from to million will be paid in the first quarter of based on sales milestones for fiscal year we have excluded long term tax liabilities of million at december  related to uncertain tax positions from the amounts presented as the amounts that will be settled in cash are not known 
off balance sheet arrangements during  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships  such as structured finance or special purpose entities  that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
recently adopted accounting principles in january  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb issued a standard that requires new disclosures about significant transfers in and out of levels and fair value measurements and separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements relating to level fair value measurements 
this standard also clarifies existing disclosure requirements regarding inputs and valuation techniques  as well as the level of disaggregation for each class of assets and liabilities for which separate fair value measurements should be disclosed 
we adopted this standard in the quarter ended march   except for the separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements relating to level measurements  which became effective for us at the beginning of fiscal year the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact  and the deferred provisions of this standard are not expected to have a material impact  on our financial statements 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued amended guidance regarding pro forma information for a business combination 
the amendment clarifies that pro forma information of the combined entity should be presented as though the business combination had occurred only as of the beginning of the comparable year 
the amendment also requires additional supplemental pro forma information concerning non recurring pro forma adjustments 
the new and updated disclosures should be applied prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december   with earlier application permitted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain financial market risks  the most predominate being foreign exchange rate risk 
interest rate risk we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  we held these amounts primarily in cash or money market funds 
we hold cash and cash equivalents for working capital purposes 
we do not have material exposure to market risk with respect to investments  as our investments consist primarily of highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes  however  we may adopt specific hedging strategies in the future 
any declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future interest income 
foreign currency risk as a global company  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our revenue from our foreign subsidiaries was approximately of our total revenue for the year ended december  the primary foreign currencies that we invoice and on which we collect are the euro and british pound sterling and to a lesser extent the australian dollar 
expenses incurred by our international subsidiaries are generally denominated in the local currency of the subsidiary 
our consolidated statements of income are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period 
to the extent the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in reduced revenues  operating expense  and net income for our international operations 
similarly  our revenues  operating expenses  and net income will increase for our international operations if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts or any other similar contracts to hedge exposure denominated in foreign currencies or any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  although we may do so in the future 
thus  fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars in consolidation 
if there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates  the conversion of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars will lead to a translation gain or loss which is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity deficit
