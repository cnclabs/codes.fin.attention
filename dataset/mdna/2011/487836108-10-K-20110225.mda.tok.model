md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in item of this report 
kellogg company is the world s leading producer of cereal and a leading producer of convenience foods  including cookies  crackers  toaster pastries  cereal bars  fruit flavored snacks  frozen waffles  and veggie foods 
kellogg products are manufactured and marketed globally 
we currently manage our operations in four geographic operating segments  comprised of north america and the three international operating segments of europe  latin america  and asia pacific 
we manage our company for sustainable performance defined by our long term annual growth targets 
these targets are to for internal net sales  mid single digit to for internal operating profit  and high single digit to for diluted net earnings per share eps on a currency neutral basis

while was a difficult year  we have taken actions to regain momentum in we believe we can achieve our objectives through increased innovation and investments in brand building initiatives 
kellogg has over a year heritage with strong brands 
in combination with an attractive dividend yield  we believe our business model will provide a strong total return to our shareholders

b we measure the volume impact tonnage on revenues based on the stated weight of our product shipments 
our consolidated net sales were down on both a reported and internal basis 
there were four major issues that affected our results 
first  our categories respond to innovation and brand building 
we did not have sufficient cereal innovations in rather  we focused on renovating our existing cereal products 
we invested in renovation to improve the nutritional profile of our products 
for  we have a stronger innovation pipeline to drive top line growth 
secondly  we experienced supply chain disruptions in our waffle business and had a second quarter recall of select packages of breakfast cereals 
as a result  we have increased investment in our supply chain to mitigate potential risks 
next  we experienced weakness in our core cereal businesses in both measured and non measured channels 
lastly  the competitive environment drove price deflation into the cereal category 
in late we announced price increases driven by higher input costs on many products across our categories around the world 
internal net sales for our north america operating segment declined 
north america has three product groups retail cereal  retail snacks and frozen and specialty channels 
retail cereal s internal net sales declined by on a full year basis 
our consumption was negatively impacted by the impact of the cereal recall that occurred in the second quarter of the brands involved in the recall were the cornerstone of our back to school promotions in the third quarter 
promotional pricing drove deflation into the category  but did not drive higher category volumes as would be expected 
the us cereal category responds well to innovation 
while there were lower levels of innovation across the category in  our innovations performed well 
we have also been impacted by less support from non measured channels this year 
trade inventory levels at the end of were higher than normal 
as a result  our sales were negatively impacted as retailers sold through their inventory  reducing their purchases from us 
the retail snack product group cookies  crackers  toaster pastries  cereal bars  and fruit flavored snacks grew by 
the modest growth was driven by pop tarts and strong wholesome snack sales including our bar innovations such as fiberplus and special k fruit crisps 
the strong performance in wholesome snacks was masked by weaker performance in cookies and to a lesser extent crackers 
we were able to maintain our cracker category share in measured channels despite increased competitive promotional activity 
consumption in the cookie category was down for the year 
our cookie performance was also impacted by the loss of shelf space in non measured channels  which we were able to regain during the fourth quarter of internal net sales in the frozen and specialty channels frozen foods  food service and vending decreased by 
our sales were negatively impacted during the year due to the waffle supply disruption that began late in we have returned to full capacity and have introduced new innovations 
while the business rebounded slower than expected during as it took longer to rebuild and reset retailer shelves  we have reinstated brand building and the business is responding positively 
our veggie business continues to perform well  particularly morningstar farms burgers and entrees 
our food service business grew during the year  continuing to outperform the industry 
our international operating segments internal net sales were flat compared to the prior year 
europe s internal net sales declined for the year 
the cereal category as measured by consumption declined in our core european countries such as the uk additionally  we saw price deflation in many food categories across europe  especially in the uk continued weakness in the russia snack business drove lower volumes and contributed to europe s lower top line results 
we worked to stabilize the bulk business while introducing packaged snacks in russia 
latin america s internal net sales growth was 
the growth in cereal masked the decline in snacks 
our decline in snacks was largely driven by venezuela where we import some products from mexico 
the imports were impacted by exchange rate controls and it is no longer cost efficient to import goods 
internal net sales in asia pacific grew driven by strong performance across most of asia  as well as south africa 
this was muted by a decline in australia where the cereal category faced price deflation 
consolidated operating profit declined by on an as reported basis and was flat on an internal basis  when excluding the impact of foreign currency translation 
operating profit for the year was negatively impacted by the cereal recall  higher than expected commodity inflation and investments in our supply chain 
operating profit benefited from lower incentive compensation expense 
incentive compensation is based upon the company s actual results compared to our target 
given results were lower than our targets  which were set at the beginning of  incentive compensation decreased significantly compared to the prior year 
despite s operating performance  we recognized the need to invest in advertising 
accordingly  we increased our spending in advertising by  excluding the impact of foreign currency translation 
internal operating profit in north america decreased by  europe s grew by  latin america s declined by and asia pacific s declined by 
north america s decline was attributable to lower sales in our us cereal business 
competitive activity drove lower cereal sales as did the second quarter cereal recall 
these negative drivers were partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense and decreased spending on cost reduction initiatives 
europe s operating profit increased due to lower commodity costs and less spending on cost reduction initiatives 
the decline in latin america s operating profit is primarily a result of higher commodity costs 
asia pacific s operating profit was negatively impacted by the impairment charges related to our business in china

c impact of results for the year to date period ended january  from the acquisitions of united bakers  navigable foods  specialty cereal and certain assets and liabilities of indybake 
d impact of rd shipping week in our consolidated reported net sales were down compared to the prior year  driven by a negative impact from foreign currency translation and an extra shipping week in excluding this negative impact  internal net sales grew by  lapping s strong growth 
while overall volume declined  we achieved internal net sales growth driven by a particularly strong year in retail cereal and a solid year in retail snacks resulting from our pricing and mix 
there were several factors contributing to the volume decline 
in north america  we experienced a supply disruption in our waffle plants 
in both russia and china  we started moving our businesses away from lower margin products to higher margin branded products  which resulted in a decline in volume during the year 
our north america operating segment had internal net sales growth of almost against a difficult comparative in we experienced growth in retail cereal of and growth in retail snacks  which includes cookies  crackers  toaster pastries  cereal bars and fruit snacks 
weakness in frozen and specialty channels  which includes frozen foods  food service and vending  dampened net sales for the year  with a decline in net sales of 
we experienced broad based growth in retail snacks  with sales growth of 
pop tarts performed well as the category leader in north america toaster pastries 
a strong performance by cheez it as well as innovation  drove growth in crackers 
cookies posted a slight gain for the year led by mother s brand cookies 
our growth was negatively impacted by heavy competitor activity 
our best performing category within retail snacks was wholesome snacks 
the introduction of fiber plus  special k chocolaty pretzel and cinnabon bars drove growth in this category 
our frozen and specialty channels business was down due to a few discrete issues 
our food service business is mostly non commercial  serving institutions such as schools  hospitals and prisons 
this sector of the industry was not immediately impacted by the economic downturn that started in while we started to see recovery in  it was slower than the commercial sectors such as hotels and restaurants 
we were also experiencing a supply disruption in our waffle facilities 
we made improvements in our facilities and worked with regulatory agencies 
a combination of extensive enhancements and repairs at our facilities and a flood at one facility  significantly impacted production in the second half of while our plants were operational at the end of  they were not running at their previous level of capacity 
demand continued to exceed supply 
our international operating segments collectively achieved net sales growth of on an internal basis 
europe s internal net sales increased year over year 
europe was a tough environment for us during the year 
we encountered some retailer disputes earlier in that were resolved in the second half of the year  helping us to achieve cereal volume growth 
latin america s internal net sales growth was attributable to both volume and price increases driven by retail cereal in mexico and venezuela 
internal net sales in asia pacific grew  driven by strong cereal performances in australia and india 
our consolidated operating profit increased by on an internal basis and by on a reported basis 
reported operating profit in each of our operating segments was negatively impacted by foreign exchange as well as the absence of a rd week in in  we continued to experience cost pressures  increased our spending on cost reduction initiatives  and invested in advertising 
we were able to more than offset these increased costs by savings from our cost reduction and productivity initiatives as well as pricing and mix 
during the full year of up front costs were million  which were million higher than the previous year 
up front costs represent both exit or disposal activities as well as other cost reduction initiatives 
north america s internal operating profit growth of was driven by price and savings from our cost reduction initiatives  which was partially offset by significantly higher up front costs and increased advertising 
up front costs reduced north america s operating profit by 
europe s internal operating profit increased benefiting from media deflation and operating efficiencies while absorbing higher up front costs which reduced reported operating profit by 
internal operating profit decreased in latin america due to significantly higher material costs and increased advertising 
internal operating profit growth in asia pacific was due to sales growth  while reported operating profit was negatively impacted by the acquisition of navigable foods 
for further information on our acquisitions  see note within notes to consolidated financial statements 
margin performance margin performance was as follows change vs 
prior year pts 
gross margin a sga b operating margin a gross profit as a percentage of net sales 
gross profit is equal to net sales less cost of goods sold 
b selling  general  and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales 
as illustrated in the preceding table  our consolidated gross margin declined by basis points in due to the cereal recall  increased cost pressures for fuel  energy  commodities and employee benefits and supply chain investments  which were more than offset by savings from cost reduction initiatives and lower up front costs recorded in cost of sales cogs 
our selling  general and administrative sga expense as a percentage of net sales decreased by basis points primarily due to a reduction in incentive compensation expense and lower costs for cost reduction initiatives  which more than offset increased advertising investment and a goodwill impairment 
our consolidated gross margin increased by basis points in acquisitions lowered gross margin by approximately basis points 
we experienced inflationary cost pressures for fuel  energy  commodities and employee benefits 
during  higher costs  including increased investment in up front costs recorded in cogs  were more than offset by savings from cost reduction initiatives and price increases 
our sga expense as a percentage of net sales increased slightly due to higher costs for cost reduction initiatives of million recorded in overhead as well as an increase in advertising spend 
foreign currency translation the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar 
certain of our assets  liabilities  expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily in the euro  british pound  mexican peso  australian dollar and canadian dollar 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements  we must translate those assets  liabilities  expenses and revenues into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates 
as a result  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements  even if their value has not changed in their original currency 
this could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar is substantial 
volatility in the foreign exchange markets has limited our ability to forecast future us dollar reported earnings 
as such  we are measuring diluted earnings per share growth and providing guidance on future earnings on a currency neutral basis  assuming earnings are translated at the prior year s exchange rates 
this non gaap financial measure is being used to focus management and investors on local currency business results  thereby providing visibility to the underlying trends of the company 
management believes that excluding the impact of foreign currency from eps provides a useful measurement of comparability given the volatility in foreign exchange markets 
below is a reconciliation of reported eps to currency neutral eps for the fiscal years  and consolidated results diluted net earnings per share eps translational impact a currency neutral eps currency neutral eps growth b a translation impact is the difference between reported eps and the translation of current year net profits at prior year exchange rates  adjusted for gains losses on translational hedges  if applicable 
b calculated as a percentage of growth from the prior year s reported eps 
exit or disposal activities we view our continued spending on cost reduction initiatives as part of our ongoing operating principles to provide greater visibility in achieving our long term profit growth targets 
initiatives undertaken are currently expected to recover cash implementation costs within a five year period of completion 
upon completion or as each major stage is completed in the case of multi year programs  the project begins to deliver cash savings and or reduced depreciation 
we incurred costs that qualify as exit costs under us generally accepted accounting principles 
refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements for further detail on our exit or disposal plans 
we include these charges in our measure of operating segment profitability 
management announced its intention to achieve billion of annual cost savings in three years 
the savings challenge began in with a goal of achieving billion of savings by the end of these initiatives are integral to meeting our savings challenge 
other cost reduction initiatives activities in addition to exit costs  we incurred costs related to our cost reduction initiatives which do not qualify as exit costs under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
these represent cash costs for consulting and other charges for our cogs and sga programs that are discussed in further detail in note within notes to consolidated financial statements 
costs incurred in fiscal year as well as total program costs are as follows millions for the year ended january  total program costs through january  cogs programs sga programs total cogs programs sga programs total north america europe latin america asia pacific corporate total the additional cost and cash outlay in for these programs  excluding exit costs  is estimated to be to million 
sap reimplementation we are reimplementing sap which will result in process and productivity improvements 
the program is expected to require approximately million of expense  in addition to capital investments 
we are incurring incremental consulting costs associated with the reimplementation  which will begin in during  we incurred approximately million of cash consulting costs associated with the sap reimplementation 
the costs were recorded in sga expense within the north america operating segment for million and the latin america operating segment for million 
the additional cost and cash outlay in and for this program  is estimated to be million 
this program is not included in the table above 
prior year activities during  we incurred million of costs related to our on going cogs and sga programs 
these represent cash costs for consulting and other charges 
the costs by program and segment were as follows in millions millions for the year ended  january  cogs programs sga programs total north america europe latin america asia pacific total interest expense as illustrated in the following table  annual interest expense for the to periods has trended downward 
the decline in was due primarily to costs incurred in for early redemption of long term debt and lower interest rates on our long term debt 
interest income recorded in other income expense  net was in millions    the decline for was primarily due to a drop in average interest rates 
we currently expect that our gross interest expense will be approximately to million 
change vs 
prior year dollars in millions reported interest expense a amounts capitalized gross interest expense a reported interest expense for includes charges of approximately million related to the early redemption of long term debt 
income taxes our reported effective tax rates for  and were  and respectively 
the impact of discrete adjustments and the cost of remitted and unremitted foreign earnings reduced our effective income tax rate by percentage points for for and  the impact was a reduction of and respectively 
refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
for  we expect our consolidated effective income tax rate to be approximately 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact the expected effective income tax rate as it is dependent upon us dollar earnings of foreign subsidiaries doing business in various countries with differing statutory tax rates 
additionally  the rate could be impacted if pending uncertain tax matters  including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives  are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect 
product withdrawal refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions 
our cash generating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs 
we believe that our operating cash flows  together with our credit facilities and other available debt financing  will be adequate to meet our operating  investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that volatility and or disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows millions net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities the principal source of our operating cash flows is net earnings  meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products  net of costs to manufacture and market our products 
our net cash provided by operating activities for amounted to  million  a decrease of million compared with the reduction in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to higher pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions and increased payments for advertising and promotion in our net cash provided by operating activities for amounted to  million  an increase of million compared with  reflecting lower pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions and the impact of lower payments for advertising and promotion in our cash conversion cycle defined as days of inventory and trade receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding  based on a trailing month average is relatively short  equating to approximately days for  days for  and days for during  the impact of higher days of inventory outstanding was offset by an increase in days of trade payables outstanding 
days of inventory outstanding reflected the higher levels needed to improve order fill levels  along with the impact of lower reported sales in core working capital in averaged of net sales  compared to in the prior year 
the increase in s cash conversion cycle was the result of a decrease in days of trade payables outstanding  which led to a basis point increase in core working capital as an average of net sales in compared with our total pension and postretirement benefit plan funding amounted to million  million and million  in  and  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of  we made incremental contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans amounting to million million  net of tax 
we also made additional plan contributions amounting to million in the fourth quarter of  after adverse conditions in the equity markets caused the actual rate of return on our pension and postretirement plan assets to be significantly below our assumed long term rate of return of 
the pension protection act ppa  and subsequent regulations  determines defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements in the united states 
we believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under ppa requirements until or beyond 
our projections concerning timing of ppa funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance  future discount rates based on average yields of high quality corporate bonds and our decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa 
we currently project that we will make total us and foreign benefit plan contributions in of approximately million 
actual contributions could be different from our current projections  as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities  future changes in government requirements  trust asset performance  renewals of union contracts  or higher than expected health care claims cost experience 
we measure cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions 
we use this non gaap financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment  dividend distributions  acquisition opportunities  and share repurchases 
our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure  as follows dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities additions to properties cash flow year over year change year over year changes in cash flow as defined were driven by variations in the amount of contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans and changes in the level of capital expenditures during the three year period 
for  we are expecting cash flow as defined to be billion to billion  which reflects the impact of expected pension contributions  net of tax 
investing activities our net cash used in investing activities for amounted to million  an increase of million compared with due to a higher level of capital expenditures in capital spending in included investments in our information technology infrastructure related to the reimplementation and upgrade of our sap platform and investments in our supply chain 
in  we spent capital for a new facility to manufacture ready to eat cereal in mexico and completed the expansion of the global research center located in battle creek  michigan  the w 
k 
kellogg institute for food and nutrition research 
the investment in our global research center  which began in  reflects our commitment to innovation which is a key driver to the growth of our business 
in  we also incurred construction costs to increase manufacturing capacity in europe 
net cash used in investing activities of million in decreased by million compared with  reflecting a reduction in business acquisition activity  and to a lesser extent  lower capital spending 
during  we used cash to expand our platform for future growth with acquisitions in russia  china  the us and australia 
acquisitions are discussed in note within notes to consolidated financial statements 
cash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales amounted to in  in  and in we anticipate spending approximately of net sales for additions to properties in in addition to continuing to invest in our supply chain and information technology infrastructure  our spending will also focus on increasing capacity to facilitate growth and innovation 
financing activities our net cash used in financing activities for  and amounted to million   million  and million  respectively 
total debt was billion at year end and billion at year end in december  we issued billion of ten year fixed rate us dollar notes  using a portion of the million net proceeds to make incremental pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions 
the proceeds were also used to retire commercial paper 
taking into consideration the impact of hedge settlements and the issuance discount  the effective interest rate on the notes issued in december is 
in november  we issued million of ten year fixed rate us dollar notes  and used proceeds of million to retire a portion of our us dollar notes due we retired million of the debt  which had an effective interest rate of  through a tender offer 
in connection with the debt retirement  we recognized million of interest expense and an acceleration of million loss on an interest rate swap  which was previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
these charges were included in cash flows from operating activities 
in may  we issued million of seven year fixed rate us dollar notes  and used proceeds of million to pay down commercial paper 
in may  we also entered into interest rate swaps on  million of our debt 
interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling million effectively converted our us dollar notes due from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation for the remainder of the five year term 
in addition  interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling million effectively converted a portion of our us dollar notes due from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation for the remaining term 
in march  we issued million of five year fixed rate us dollar notes under an existing shelf registration statement 
we used proceeds of million from issuance of this long term debt to retire a portion of our commercial paper 
in conjunction with this debt issuance  we entered into interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling million  which effectively converted this debt from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation for the duration of the five year term 
in  we had cash outflows of million in connection with the repayment of five year us dollar notes at maturity in june that debt had an effective interest rate of we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock in for billion under a share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in april this program authorized repurchases of our common stock amounting to billion during through this three year authorization replaced a previous share buyback program which had authorized stock repurchases of up to billion for during and  we plan to execute the remaining repurchases under the authorization  with projected purchases of million in and the balance in we expect average shares outstanding to decline by percent compared with actual repurchases could be different from our current projections  as influenced by factors such as changes in our stock price and other competing priorities 
during  we spent million to repurchase million of our shares while in we spent million to repurchase million shares 
our board of directors had authorized annual stock repurchases of up to million for and in addition  a separate million share repurchase authorization received board approval in we made no repurchases under this authorization  which was later terminated  because we decided to use cash to fund pension and postretirement benefit plans and reduce commercial paper 
we paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling per share in  per share in and per share in total cash paid for dividends increased by in and in our objective is to maintain our dividend pay out ratio between and of reported net earnings 
our long term debt agreements contain customary covenants that limit the company and some of its subsidiaries from incurring certain liens or from entering into certain sale and lease back transactions 
some agreements also contain change in control provisions 
however  they do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings 
a change in the company s credit ratings could limit our access to the us short term debt market and or increase the cost of refinancing long term debt in the future 
however  even under these circumstances  we would continue to have access to our five year credit agreement  which expires in november under this facility  we can borrow up to billion on a revolving credit basis 
this source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis  although we do not currently plan to use it 
we are in the process of entering into a new credit agreement that will replace the existing agreement 
we plan to use commercial paper to refinance our million of debt maturing in the first quarter of during the third quarter of and thereafter  capital and credit markets  including commercial paper markets  experienced increased instability and disruption as the us and global economies underwent a period of extreme uncertainty 
throughout this period of uncertainty  we continued to have access to the us and canadian commercial paper markets 
our commercial paper and term debt credit ratings were not affected by the changes in the credit environment 
we monitor the financial strength of our third party financial institutions  including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities  our derivative financial instruments  and other arrangements 
we continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future  while still meeting our operational needs  including the pursuit of selected bolt on acquisitions 
this will be accomplished through our strong cash flow  our short term borrowings  and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements as of january  and january  we did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at january  contractual obligations payments due by period millions total and beyond long term debt principal interest a capital leases b operating leases c purchase obligations d uncertain tax positions e other long term obligations f total a includes interest payments on our long term debt and payments on our interest rate swaps 
interest calculated on our variable rate debt was forecasted using the libor forward rate curve as of january  b the total expected cash payments on our capital leases include interest expense totaling approximately million over the periods presented above 
c operating leases represent the minimum rental commitments under non cancelable operating leases 
d purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments for raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business and for marketing  advertising and other services 
the amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or other current liabilities at year end  nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans  but are not obligated to incur 
therefore  it should be noted that the exclusion of these items from the table could be a limitation in assessing our total future cash flows under contracts 
e as of january   our total liability for uncertain tax positions was million  of which million  is expected to be paid in the next twelve months 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the remaining million 
f other long term obligations are those associated with noncurrent liabilities recorded within the consolidated balance sheet at year end and consist principally of projected commitments under deferred compensation arrangements  multiemployer plans  and supplemental employee retirement benefits 
the table also includes our current estimate of minimum contributions to defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans through as follows      while the table reflects the estimated minimum plan contributions  it does not include the total planned contributions to us and foreign benefit plans 
for  we are currently projecting that we will make total benefit plan contributions of approximately million 
critical accounting estimates promotional expenditures our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as in store displays and events  feature price discounts  consumer coupons  contests and loyalty programs 
the costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded  which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure 
the recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer 
these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs 
differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period 
on a full year basis  these subsequent period adjustments have rarely represented more than of our company s net sales 
however  our company s total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a revenue reduction represented approximately of net sales  therefore  it is likely that our results would be materially different if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 
property long lived assets such as property  plant and equipment are tested for impairment when conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
management evaluates several conditions  including  but not limited to  the following a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or an asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used  including an extended period of idleness  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
for assets to be held and used  we project the expected future undiscounted cash flows generated by the long lived asset or asset group over the remaining useful life of the primary asset 
if the cash flow analysis yields an amount less than the carrying amount we determine the fair value of the asset or asset group by using comparable market data 
there are inherent uncertainties associated with the judgments and estimates we use in these analyses 
at january   we have property plant and equipment of billion  net of accumulated depreciation  on our balance sheet 
included in this amount are approximately million of idle assets 
the largest individual idle asset is a facility outside the united states which we tested for impairment on a held and used basis 
the estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceeded the net book value of the facility as of january  management estimates the plant will be deployed within the next several years 
should management s plan for deployment change  this could result in an impairment charge of up to million based on the current carrying value 
goodwill and other intangible assets we perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process 
goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill 
carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit  which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units 
for the goodwill impairment test  the fair value of the reporting units was estimated based on market multiples 
our approach employs market multiples based on earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  earnings for companies comparable to our reporting units and discounted cash flows 
management believes the assumptions used for the impairment test are consistent with those utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for our reporting units 
similarly  impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset 
fair values of non goodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset 
for instance  cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales discounted at rates consistent with rates used by market participants 
these estimates are made using various inputs including historical data  current and anticipated market conditions  management plans  and market comparables 
we also evaluate the useful life over which a non goodwill intangible asset with a finite life is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the cash flows of the company 
reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence  demand  competition  other economic factors such as the stability of the industry  known technological advances  legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment  and expected changes in distribution channels  the level of required maintenance expenditures  and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 
at january   goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to billion  consisting primarily of goodwill and trademarks associated with the acquisition of keebler foods company 
within this total  approximately billion of non goodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinite lived  comprised principally of keebler trademarks 
we currently believe that the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds their carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to the cash flows of the company 
at january   the fair value of our north america snacks reporting unit was almost twice its book value 
however  if we had used materially different assumptions  which we do not believe are reasonably possible  regarding the future performance of our business or a different weighted average cost of capital in the valuation  this could have resulted in significant impairment losses 
additionally  we have million of goodwill related to our acquisition of united bakers in russia 
the percentage of excess fair value over carrying value of the russian reporting unit declined in from an excess of to an excess of 
the year over year decline was attributable to lower margins resulting from our strategy to stabilize the bulk snack business  while introducing packaged snacks  as well as reintroducing cereal into the market 
if we used modestly different assumptions regarding sales multiples and earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda in the valuation  this could have resulted in an impairment loss 
for example  if our projection of ebitda margins had been lower by basis points  this change in assumption may have resulted in impairment of some or all of the goodwill in the russian reporting unit 
management will continue to monitor the situation closely 
retirement benefits our company sponsors a number of us and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the united states and canada 
plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations and asset return performance 
a substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments 
we recognize the cost of benefits provided during retirement over the employees active working life to determine the obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans 
inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date 
major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the long term rates of return on plan assets  the health care cost trend rates  and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans  which cover employees in the united states  united kingdom and canada 
to conduct our annual review of the long term rate of return on plan assets  we model expected returns over a year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans 
the return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forward looking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on long term bonds  price earnings ratios of the major stock market indices  and long term inflation 
our us plan model  corresponding to approximately of our trust assets globally  currently incorporates a long term inflation assumption of and an active management premium of net of fees validated by historical analysis 
although we review our expected long term rates of return annually  our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not  by itself  significantly influence our evaluation 
our expected rates of return are generally not revised  provided these rates continue to fall within a more likely than not corridor of between the th and th percentile of expected long term returns  as determined by our modeling process 
our assumed rate of return for us plans in of equated to approximately the nd percentile expectation of our model 
similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets  reflecting local economic conditions 
foreign trust investments represent approximately of our global benefit plan assets 
based on consolidated benefit plan assets at january   a basis point reduction in the assumed rate of return would increase benefits expense by approximately million 
correspondingly  a basis point shortfall between the assumed and actual rate of return on plan assets for would result in a similar amount of arising experience loss 
any arising asset related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated value of plan assets over a five year period 
once recognized  experience gains and losses are amortized using a declining balance method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants  which for us plans is presently about years 
under this recognition method  a basis point shortfall in actual versus assumed performance of all of our plan assets in would reduce pre tax earnings by approximately million in  increasing to approximately million in for each of the three fiscal years  our actual return on plan assets exceeded was less than the recognized assumed return by the following amounts in millions   
to conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates  we model our actual claims cost data over a five year historical period  including an analysis of pre versus post age groups and other important demographic components in our covered retiree population 
this data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends 
our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding short term future trends 
in comparison to our actual five year compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately  our initial trend rate for of reflects the expected future impact of faster growing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population 
our initial rate is trended downward by per year  until the ultimate trend rate of is reached 
the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually  as necessary  to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium 
based on consolidated obligations at january   a basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase benefits expense by approximately million 
a basis point excess of actual health care claims cost over that calculated from the assumed trend rate would result in an arising experience loss of approximately million 
any arising health care claims cost related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated amount of claims experience over a four year period 
once recognized  experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method over years 
the net experience gain arising from recognition of claims experience was approximately million 
to conduct our annual review of discount rates  we selected the discount based on a cash flow matching analysis using towers watson s proprietary rate link tool and projections of the future benefit payments constituting the projected benefit obligation for the plans 
prior to  we employed a similar methodology  but used the spot yield curve underlying the citigroup index 
there was no material difference in the discount rate resulting from the change 
rate link establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments  as is generated by discounting each year s benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year 
the spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the th to th percentile of us high quality bonds 
a similar methodology is applied in canada and europe  except the smaller bond markets imply that yields between the th and th percentiles are preferable 
the measurement dates for our defined benefit plans are consistent with our fiscal year end 
accordingly  we select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during december of each year 
based on consolidated obligations at january   a basis point decline in the weighted average discount rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would increase benefits expense by approximately million 
all obligation related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants 
despite the previously described rigorous policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions  we periodically experience material differences between assumed and actual experience 
as of january   we had consolidated unamortized prior service cost and net experience losses of approximately billion  similar to approximately billion at january  of the total unamortized amounts at january   approximately billion was related to asset losses that occurred during  offset by billion in asset gains during and  with the remainder largely related to discount rate reductions and net unfavorable health care claims experience including upward revisions in the assumed trend rate prior to for  we currently expect total amortization of prior service cost and net experience losses to be approximately million higher than the actual amount of approximately million 
total employee benefit expense for is expected to be higher than due to lower discount rates  a further phase in of the investment losses  offset by better than expected and investment performance 
based on our current actuarial assumptions  we expect pension expense to increase primarily due to further phase in of investment losses 
during we made contributions in the amount of million to kellogg s global tax qualified pension programs 
this amount was mostly discretionary 
additionally we contributed million to our retiree medical programs  most of this contribution was also discretionary and largely used to fund benefit obligations related to our union retiree healthcare benefits 
assuming actual future experience is consistent with our current assumptions  annual amortization of accumulated prior service cost and net experience losses during each of the next several years would increase versus the amount 
income taxes our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
the calculation of our income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment 
income taxes are provided on the portion of foreign earnings that is expected to be remitted to and taxable in the united states 
we recognize tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions when  in our judgment  it is more likely than not that the positions will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority 
for tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold  we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefits as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances  such as the progress of tax audits  new or emerging legislation and tax planning 
the tax position will be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained 
significant adjustments to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits impacting our effective tax rate are separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of note within notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounting standards to be adopted in future periods in december  the financial accounting standards board issued a new accounting standard related to application of the goodwill impairment model when a reporting unit has a carrying amount that is zero or a negative value 
the new standard clarifies that when this is the case  a goodwill impairment test should be performed if qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill impairment exists 
we will adopt this new accounting standard in the first quarter of we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
future outlook we have taken actions to regain momentum in through increased innovation and by investing in our brands and our supply chain 
we have strong innovations and expect improved trends in our core categories 
we expect our internal net sales will grow by to percent 
internal operating profit is expected to be flat to down percent  resulting from the increase in cost pressures as well as a comparison issue related to incentive compensation which was significantly lower in due to our results 
earnings per share on a currency neutral basis is expected to grow low single digits 
gross profit margin is expected to be down slightly for the year 
gross interest expense is expected to be to million 
we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 
lastly  we expect our cash flow performance to remain strong and are currently expecting s cash flow to be between and billion 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our company is exposed to certain market risks  which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations 
we use derivative financial and commodity instruments  where appropriate  to manage these risks 
as a matter of policy  we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions 
refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our derivative financial and commodity instruments 
foreign exchange risk our company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related primarily to third party purchases  intercompany transactions  and when applicable  nonfunctional currency denominated third party debt 
our company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments 
additionally  our company is exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency denominated earnings to us dollars 
primary exposures include the us dollar versus the british pound  euro  australian dollar  canadian dollar  and mexican peso  and in the case of inter subsidiary transactions  the british pound versus the euro 
we assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and may enter into forward contracts  options  and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in long or short currency positions 
forward contracts and options are generally less than months duration 
currency swap agreements are established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issuances 
the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year end was  million  representing a settlement obligation of million 
the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year end was  million  representing a settlement obligation of million 
all of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions  translational exposure  or existing assets or liabilities  and mature within months 
assuming an unfavorable change in year end exchange rates  the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately million at year end and million at year end these unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures 
venezuela was designated as a highly inflationary economy as of the beginning of our fiscal year 
gains and losses resulting from the translation of the financial statements of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in earnings 
as of the end of our fiscal year  we used the parallel rate to translate our venezuelan subsidiary s financial statements to us dollars 
in may  the venezuelan government effectively eliminated the parallel market 
in june  several large venezuelan commercial banks began operating the transaction system for foreign currency denominated securities sitme 
we intend to use sitme to settle us dollar denominated assets and liabilities 
accordingly  we are using the sitme rate at january  to translate our venezuelan subsidiary s financial statements to us dollars 
during the second quarter of  we recorded an million foreign exchange gain in other income expense  net  associated with the translation of our subsidiary s financials into us dollars  with the net impact for full year amounting to a million gain 
on a consolidated basis  venezuela represents only to of our business  therefore  any ongoing impact is expected to be immaterial 
interest rate risk our company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt 
primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates  london interbank offered rates libor  and commercial paper rates 
we periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated with certain debt issues  and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt  based on current and projected market conditions 
during and  we entered into interest rate swaps in connection with certain us dollar notes 
refer to disclosures contained in note within notes to consolidated financial statements 
the total notional amount of interest rate swaps at year end was  million  representing a settlement receivable of million 
the total notional amount of interest rate swaps at year end was  million  representing a settlement receivable of million 
assuming average variable rate debt levels during the year  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately million at year end and million at year end price risk our company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials  fuel  and energy 
primary exposures include corn  wheat  soybean oil  sugar  cocoa  paperboard  natural gas  and diesel fuel 
we have historically used the combination of long term contracts with suppliers  and exchange traded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted raw material purchases over a duration of generally less than months 
during  we entered into two separate year over the counter commodity swap transactions to reduce fluctuations in the price of natural gas used principally in our manufacturing processes 
the notional amount of the swaps totaled million as of january  and equates to approximately of our north america manufacturing needs over the remaining hedge period 
at year end january  the notional amount was million 
the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at year end  including the north america natural gas swaps  was million  representing a settlement obligation of approximately million 
the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at year end  including the natural gas swaps  was million  representing a settlement obligation of approximately million 
assuming a decrease in year end commodity prices  the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately million at year end  and million at year end  generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases 
in some instances the company has reciprocal collateralization agreements with counterparties regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds 
these agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash  treasury securities or letters of credit if a fair value loss position to the company or our counterparties exceeds a certain amount 
there were no collateral balance requirements at january  or january  in addition to the commodity derivative instruments discussed above  we use long term contracts with suppliers to manage a portion of the price exposure associated with future purchases of certain raw materials  including rice  sugar  cartonboard  and corrugated boxes 
it should be noted the exclusion of these contracts from the analysis above could be a limitation in assessing the net market risk of our company
