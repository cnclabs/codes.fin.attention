overview widepoint corporation is a technology based provider of product and services to both the government sector and commercial markets 
widepoint corporation was incorporated in delaware on may  we have grown through the merger with and acquisition of highly specialized regional it consulting companies 
our expertise lies in the following three business segments wireless mobility management  cybersecurity solutions  and consulting services and products 
these business segments offer unique solutions in wireless mobility  cybersecurity and other associated it consulting services and products in which we provide specific subject matter expertise in it architecture and planning  software implementation services  it outsourcing  and forensic informatics 
for additional information related to our three business segments  see note to our financial statements in this annual report on form k 
widepoint has four material operational entities  which specialize in providing the following products and services orc specializes in cybersecurity solutions with a focus in it integration and secure authentication processes and software  and providing services to the federal government 
orc has been at the forefront of implementing public key infrastructure pki technologies 
pki technology uses a class of algorithms in which a user can receive two electronic keys  consisting of a public key and a private key  to encrypt any information and or communication being transmitted to or from the user within a computer network and between different computer networks 
pki technology is rapidly becoming the technology of choice to enable security services within and between different computer systems utilized by various agencies and departments of the federal government 
isys specializes in wireless mobility solutions  forensic informatics  and ia services  predominantly to various agencies and departments of the federal government 
widepoint  il specializes in it consulting services predominately in the chicago  illinois regional area and cross sells various services of our other operating subsidiaries 
arcc specializes in providing identity assurance and priority resource management solutions  crime scene management and information protection  and other activities related or incidental thereto  and the development  maintenance  enhancement and provision of software  services  products and operations for identity management and information protection  which are offered primarily to state and local government agency markets 
protexx  which is a development stage company  specializes in identity assurance  and mobile and wireless data protection products and services 
we intend to continue to market and sell our technical capabilities into the governmental and commercial marketplace 
further  we are continuing to actively search out new synergistic acquisitions that we believe may further enhance our present base of business and service offerings 
this effort has already been evidenced by our acquisitions of orc and isys  our asset purchases of protexx and arcc  as well as our internal growth initiatives 
with the addition of the customer base and the increase in revenues attributable to our isys acquisition  widepoint s opportunity to leverage and expand further into the federal marketplace has improved substantially 
isys s past client successes  top security clearances for their personnel  and additional breadth of management talent have expanded the company s reach into markets that previously were not fully accessible to widepoint 
the company intends to continue to leverage the synergies between itself and isys  and cross sell its technical capabilities into each separate marketplace serviced by our respective subsidiaries 
our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter  due to revenues earned on contracts  the number of billable days in a quarter  the timing of the pass through of other direct costs  the commencement and completion of contracts during any particular quarter  the schedule of the government agencies for awarding contracts  the term of each contract that we have been awarded and general economic conditions 
because a significant portion of our expenses  such as personnel and facilities costs  are fixed in the short term  successful contract performance and variation in the volume of activity as well as in the number of contracts commenced or completed during any quarter may cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
as a result of our acquisitions  which predominantly operate in the us federal marketplace  we rely upon a larger portion of our revenues from the federal government directly  or as a subcontractor 
the federal government s fiscal year ends september if a budget for the next fiscal year has not been approved by that date  our clients may have to suspend engagements that we are working on until a budget has been approved 
such suspensions may cause us to realize lower revenues in the fourth calendar quarter ie  the first quarter of the government s fiscal year 
also  congressional budget continuing resolutions  which provide for funding of federal agencies at prior year spending levels may impact new awards and cause us to realize lower revenues until such time as the federal budget process for the fiscal period has been completed 
further  a change in senior government officials may negatively affect the rate at which the federal government purchases the services that we offer 
as a result of the factors above  period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful 
these comparisons are not indicators of future performance and no assurances can be given that quarterly results will not fluctuate  causing a possible material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  most of widepoint s current costs consist primarily of the salaries and benefits paid to widepoint s technical  marketing and administrative personnel as well as vendor related costs in connection with our mobile telecom managed services segment 
as a result of our plan to expand widepoint s operations through a combination of internal growth initiatives and merger and acquisition opportunities  widepoint expects such costs to increase 
widepoint s profitability also depends upon both the volume of services performed and the company s ability to manage costs 
as a significant portion of the company s cost is labor related  widepoint must effectively manage these costs to achieve and grow its profitability 
the company must also manage our airtime plans and other vendor related offerings under our mobile telecom managed services provided to our customers as they also represent a significant portion of our costs 
to date  the company has attempted to maximize its operating margins through efficiencies achieved by the use of its proprietary methodologies  and by offsetting increases in consultant compensation with increases in consultant fees received from its clients 
the uncertainties relating to the ability to achieve and maintain profitability  obtain additional funding to partially fund the company s growth strategy and provide the necessary investment to continue to upgrade its management reporting systems to meet the continuing demands of the present regulatory changes affect the comparability of the information reflected in the financial information presented above 
our staff consists of business process and computer specialists who help our government and civilian customers augment and expand their resident technologic skills and competencies  drive technical innovation  and help develop and maintain a competitive edge in today s rapidly changing technological environment in business 
our organization emphasizes an intense commitment to our people  our customers  and the quality of our solutions offerings 
as a services organization  our customers are our primary focus 
critical accounting policies and estimates fasb codification on july   the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc became the single authoritative source for nongovernmental us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the asc supersedes all previous authoritative gaap applicable to the company and is effective for interim and annual periods ended after september  the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or us gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
widepoint believes that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which the company relies are reasonably based upon information available to it at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments and assumptions and actual results  the company s financial statements will be affected 
the significant accounting policies that widepoint believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  stock based compensation  goodwill value  intangible assets value  and accounting for income taxes 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
the company s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with its audit committee 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  which contain additional information regarding accounting policies and other disclosures required by us gaap 
revenue recognition a material portion of the company s revenue arrangements are derived from cost plus fixed fee  cost plus award fee  firm fixed price or time and materials contracts with federal and state governments and their agencies 
customer orders are generally submitted through task orders or purchase requisitions under a master contract or under an individual purchase requisition 
tangible goods and services provided under customer contracts are generally not interdependent 
the company s revenue streams and related revenue recognition are as follows wireless mobility management solutions consist of managed service arrangement under which we may provide mobile telecommunications expense management  billing services and mobile device management generally under a fixed price contract 
revenue is recognized on managed services arrangements when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the contract price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes revenues and related costs on a gross basis as we have discretion in choosing providers  rate plans  and devices in providing the services to our customers and we bear risk of performance in these arrangements due to our obligations under the contract 
cybersecurity solutions consist of public key infrastructure pki identity credentialing software certificates and identity credentialing software certificate consoles and other software is recognized upon issuance and there are no undelivered elements 
revenue is recognized from the sales of credentials and consoles upon issuance 
there is no obligation to provide post contract services in relation to certificates issued and consoles delivered 
for other software  which is part of an integrated solution  revenue is recognized using percentage of completion as the individual component parts have no value until the solution has been delivered 
consulting services and products include the purchase and sale of third party hardware software and maintenance services are billed under cost reimbursable contracts 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the contract price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured

revenue is recognized to the extent of billable rates times hours delivered plus material and other reimbursable costs incurred to provide services 
goodwill goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets acquired 
the company assigns goodwill to its reporting units 
the company considers a combination of factors when evaluating the composition of its reportable operating segments  including the results reviewed by the chief operating decision maker  economic characteristics  products and services offered  classes of customers  and regulatory environment considerations 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of products and services by segment 
results of the business segments essentially treat each segment as a stand alone business 
authoritative guidance on accounting for business combinations indicates that goodwill is not subject to amortization and annual review is required for impairment 
the impairment test under current guidance is based on a two step process involving i comparing the estimated fair value of the related reporting unit to its net book value and ii comparing the estimated implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value 
goodwill impairment testing involves management judgment  requiring an assessment of whether the carrying value of the reporting unit can be supported by the fair value of the individual reporting unit using widely accepted valuation techniques  such as the market approach earnings multiples or transaction multiples or income approach discounted cash flow methods 
the fair values of the reporting units were determined using a combination of valuation techniques consistent with the income approach and the market approach 
when preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach  the company uses internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting units 
actual results may differ from forecasted results 
the company uses the expected cost of equity financing  estimated using a capital asset pricing model  to discount future cash flows for each reporting unit 
the company believes the discount rates used appropriately reflect the risks and uncertainties in the financial markets generally and specifically in the company s internally developed forecasts 
further  to assess the reasonableness of the valuations derived from the discounted cash flow models  the company also analyzes market based multiples for similar industries of the reporting unit  where available 
impairment losses are recognized whenever the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value 
the allocation of goodwill to our three business segments is based upon the original purchase price allocations when those subsidiaries were acquired 
the company s annual impairment testing date is december goodwill is a significant item on the company s balance sheet and represents approximately of our total assets as of december  goodwill is identified on the face of the consolidated balance sheet included with the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
intangibles purchase accounting intangibles the application of purchase accounting to a business acquisition requires that the company identify the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed and estimate the fair value of each 
the company recognizes the fair value of an acquired intangible apart from goodwill whenever the intangible arises from contractual or other legal rights  or when it can be separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged  either individually or in combination with a related contract  asset or liability 
acquired intangibles reported on the consolidated balance sheets consist of customer relationships  internal use software and trade names 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure 
the intangibles recognized in the acquisition are amortized over the company s estimate of their useful lives 
impairment losses are recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible subject to amortization is not recoverable from expected future cash flows and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
internally developed intangibles the company recognizes an internally developed software whenever the costs of the internally generated software are beyond the research and development stage and is provable for which the costs of such efforts are specifically identifiable  has a determinate life  is not inherent in a continuing business and is not related to a reporting entity as a whole 
internally developed software principally relates to orc s pki software supporting the sales of identity management solutions 
the software development costs recognized as internally developed are amortized over the company s estimate of their useful lives 
impairment losses are recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible subject to amortization is not recoverable from the expected future cash flows and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
long lived assets the company reviews its long lived assets  including property and equipment and identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
to determine recoverability of its long lived assets  the company evaluates the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows will be less than the carrying amount of the assets 
as of december   the company is not aware of any known trends  demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to occur and materially affect the methodology or the assumptions the company has used to value long lived assets with the exception that  in the event a disruption in federal government funding as a result of a lack of sufficient congressional budget funding results in material reductions in spending  such reductions could negatively effect the value of our long lived assets 
any impairment as a result of the estimate utilizing undiscounted net cash flows to determine the assumed value of long lived assets could have a significant impact on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations 
long lived assets are identified on the face of the consolidated balance sheet as intangibles 
amortization of intangibles is identified on the face of the consolidated statement of operations within cost of sales 
accounting for income taxes widepoint accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method whereby deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts  and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
based upon the level of profitability over the past two fiscal years and the outlook for continued profitability  management believes it will utilize some portion or all of the company s total unutilized nols  which expire in years through based upon the realization of our recent historical profitability and our outlook for continued positive prospects for these profits to continue in the future  management believes most of these net deferred tax assets will be utilized in future periods 
we continue to place a full valuation allowance on our state nols and some federal nols which the company determined will expire prior to utilization 
as such  the company reversed a substantial portion of its valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of  resulting in a net deferred tax asset of approximately million as of december  and an income tax benefit of approximately million for the year ended december  the company has been audited by the internal revenue service in and we have performed an internal revenue code section analysis and we have determined that approximately million of the company s net operating losses may be limited as a result of expirations that may occur prior to the utilization of those net operating losses under the limitations from certain changes of control that have occurred 
accounting standards updates revenue recognition in october  the fasb issued guidance to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit as these products or services often are provided at different points in time or over different time periods 
this guidance establishes how to separate deliverables and how to measure and allocate arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting and expands the disclosures related to a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangement 
the guidance will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have any significant impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
business combinations and identification of reporting units on january   the company adopted new authoritative guidance on accounting for business combinations 
the guidance establishes principles and requirements for determining how an enterprise recognizes and measures the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination  including non controlling interests  contingent consideration  and certain acquired contingent liabilities 
the guidance also requires acquisition related transaction and restructuring costs be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized as a component of the business combination 
any changes in the company s valuation allowances for acquired deferred tax assets attributable to prior business combinations will generally be reflected in income tax expense in the period in which the change occurs 
at december   there was no deferred tax asset valuation allowance that was attributable to prior business combinations 
additionally  the newly adopted authoritative guidance changes the definition of a business which can have impacts on the identification of reporting units used to measure goodwill for impairment 
the company has assessed this impact and has determined there are no material impacts to the identified reporting units to which goodwill is assigned and the related impairment testing of such goodwill 
goodwill is more fully described in note to the financial statements 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the following table sets forth selected segment and consolidated operating results and other operating data for the periods indicated 
segment operating income consists of the revenues generated by a segment  less the direct costs of revenue and selling  general and administrative costs that are incurred directly by the segment 
unallocated corporate costs include costs related to administrative functions that are performed in a centralized manner that are not attributable to a particular segment 
management does not analyze assets for decision making purposes as it relates to the segments below 
accordingly  information is not available for long lived assets or total assets 
wireless cyber consulting corp consol revenue operating income including amortization and depreciation expense interest income expense  net other income expense  net pretax income income tax benefit net income wireless cyber consulting corp consol revenue operating income including amortization and depreciation expense interest income expense  net other income expense  net pretax income income tax expense net income revenues 
revenues for the year ended december   were approximately million  an increase of million  as compared to revenues of approximately million for the year ended december  this increase was materially attributable to growth in our cybersecurity solutions segment and consulting services and products segment  offset by a slight reduction in revenues in our wireless mobility management segment 
our wireless mobility management segment experienced decreased revenue of approximately with revenues decreasing approximately million  from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  the reduction in our wireless mobility management segment was largely attributable to the decision made by washington headquarters services whs in the second half of to no longer purchase billable minutes along with the wireless management services that we presently provide to whs  which reduction was not fully offset by new agency awards we received during in the long term we anticipate our wireless mobility management segment should expand as we witness further adoption by federal government agencies and departments  and as we reach out and continue to expand our marketing to state and local municipalities and large commercial enterprises 
our cybersecurity solutions segment experienced revenue growth of approximately with revenues increasing approximately million  from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues in our cybersecurity solutions segment was primarily the result of software console sales to the department of the navy of approximately million  and the rollout of a first responder solution in the state of delaware funded by a grant made by the department of justice to delaware state university of approximately million  and continued increases in federal contractors and federal agencies adopting various credentialing programs we support 
in the long term we anticipate that our cybersecurity solutions segment should continue to grow as various us federal government and state agencies continue to sponsor and expand programs that strengthen their ability to monitor and maintain identity management solutions and as commercial enterprises adopt similar goals 
our consulting services and products segment experienced revenue growth of approximately million  from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  this growth in revenues for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase in consulting services in support of federal agencies and an increase in our reselling activities  offset slightly by a reduction in commercial consulting services 
in the long term we anticipate our consulting services and products segment should continue to grow as we expand sales and marketing efforts in support of targeting new federal agencies and other potential targets and as we cross sell our other service offerings 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues for the year ended december   was approximately million or of revenues  an increase of approximately million above cost of revenues of approximately million or of revenues  for the year ended december  this increase was materially due to a greater mix of higher margin services that were sold in our cybersecurity solutions segment in our fiscal year as compared to our fiscal year the absolute dollar increase in cost of revenues was substantially attributable to higher revenues  combined with wireless mobility management segment service offerings  including an option that provides for the payments of carrier charges on behalf of some of the customer base 
these charges are embedded into the service fees associated with the cost of providing some of our mobile telecom offerings to certain customers 
we do not separately measure our profit margins for contracts with this feature 
depreciation and amortization applied to cost of revenues decreased approximately  from  for the year ended december  to approximately  for the year ended december  this decrease was substantially a result of expiring internally generated software amortization expense in support of our cybersecurity solutions segment 
we believe that as our percentage of business from our higher margin services expands in relationship to our lower margin services  our overall cost of sales as a percentage may continue to decrease in future periods 
the cost elements related to consultant salaries  benefits and expenses at all of our subsidiaries are substantially similar 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  was approximately million or of revenues  an increase of million as compared to gross profit of approximately million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  gross profit expanded as a result of a percentage revenues due to the company s overall revenue mix 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million or of revenues  as compared to approximately million or of revenues  for the year ended december  the increase in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december   was primarily attributable to an increase in sales and marketing expenditures for new personnel  consultants  and tradeshows and conferences as we increased our efforts to expand our sales and marketing infrastructure as part of our strategy to further increase our presence into the federal marketplace 
as we expand our sales and marketing efforts these costs may increase 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million or of revenues  as compared to million or of revenues  for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to increasing general and administrative labor  fringe and overhead costs associated with operating a larger business 
as we expand the business these costs may increase on an absolute dollar basis  but on a percentage basis these costs should stabilize and or fall 
depreciation expense 
depreciation expense  net of depreciation in cost of revenues  for the year ended december  was approximately  or less than of revenues  an increase of approximately  as compared to approximately  of such expenses or less than of revenues  recorded by the company for the year ended december  the increase in depreciation expenses for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the increased pool of depreciable assets 
as we expand the business these costs may increase on an absolute dollar basis  but on a percentage basis these costs should stabilize and or fall 
interest income expense 
interest income for the year ended december  was approximately  or less than of revenues  decreased approximately  as compared to approximately  or less than of revenues for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest rates payable on bank accounts in comparison to interest expense for the year ended december  was approximately  or less than of revenues  a decrease of approximately  as compared to approximately  or less than of revenues of interest expense for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense in was primarily attributable to lesser expenses associated with the debt instruments issued by the company in connection with the acquisition of isys 
income taxes 
income taxes benefit for the year ended december  was approximately million or approximately of revenues as compared to an income tax expense of approximately  or less than of revenues for the year ended december  the company analyzed its ability to utilize net operating losses currently recorded as deferred tax assets and based on this analysis determined that it was more likely than not that the company would be able to utilize a substantial portion of its federal net operating losses in future periods 
the company reversed a substantial portion of its previous valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of  except certain federal and state net operating losses which the company determined will expire prior to utilization 
net income 
as a result of the above  the net income for the year ended december  was approximately million  an increase of million  as compared to the net income of approximately million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital the company has  since inception  financed its operations and capital expenditures through the sale of preferred and common stock  seller notes  convertible notes  convertible exchangeable debentures  senior secured loans and the proceeds from the exercise of the warrants related to a convertible exchangeable debenture 
during and  operations were primarily financed with working capital and senior debt 
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was approximately million  as compared to cash provided by operating activities of approximately million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash generated from operating activities for the year ended december  was primarily a result of higher accounts receivable and unbilled accounts receivable  offset somewhat by an increase in accounts payable 
the and cash portions of the earnout payable to the former owner of isys of approximately  and  are included in the accrued expenses at december  and  respectively 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
investing activities consisted of cash used in acquisitions  software development and purchases of property and equipment 
the increase in software development reflects completion of our latest pki authority to operate 
the increase in cash used for property and equipment reflects the down payment made to purchase the isys ohio facility in and other hardware purchased for orc s secured data facility 
capital expenditures in property and equipment were approximately  excluding any capital leases for the year ended december   as compared to capital expenditures in property and equipment of approximately  excluding capital leases for the year ended december  cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was approximately  compared to cash used in financing activities of approximately million 
the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the payoff of a sellers note in relating to the acquisition of isys 
in addition  cash received from exercised stock options in was approximately  compared to approximately  in substantially all of the increases in assets and liabilities in the company s balance sheet were attributable to the company s greater revenues and profitability in  which increased current assets and liabilities 
this was augmented by increases in goodwill as the result of the realization of the earnout by isys  llc in fiscal year  and further augmented by the continuing payoff of debt related to the company s term note in connection with the purchase of isys  llc in fiscal year and the creation of a tax asset in fiscal year the company requires substantial working capital to fund the future growth of its business  particularly to finance accounts receivable  sales and marketing efforts  and capital expenditures 
there are currently no material commitments for capital expenditures  but that could change with the addition of material contract awards 
as of december   the company had net working capital of approximately million 
the company s primary source of liquidity consists of approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately million of accounts receivable and unbilled accounts receivable 
current liabilities include approximately million in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the company believes that its current cash position is sufficient to meet capital expenditure and working capital requirements through future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of revenue growth  if any  the timing and extent of spending for new product and service development  technological changes and market acceptance of the company s services 
however  constant growth and technological change in our market makes it difficult to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty 
over the longer term  the company must successfully execute its plans to increase revenue and income streams that will generate significant positive cash flows if it is to sustain adequate liquidity without impairing growth or requiring the infusion of additional funds from external sources 
the company must also continue to generate positive cash flows to support our debt service and the continued paydown of our outstanding term note 
additionally  a major expansion might require external financing that could include additional debt or equity capital 
there can be no assurance that additional financing  if required  will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  for future acquisitions and or growth initiatives 
the company s business environment is characterized by rapid technological change  experiencing times of high growth and contraction  and is influenced by material events such as mergers and acquisitions that can substantially change the company s performance and outlook 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no existing off balance sheet arrangements as defined under sec regulations 
other inflation has not had a significant effect on the company s operations  as increased costs to the company have generally been offset by increased prices of products and services sold 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could substantially differ from those estimates 
this report contains forward looking statements setting forth the company s beliefs or expectations relating to future revenues and profitability 
actual results may differ materially from projected or expected results due to changes in the demand for the company s products and services  uncertainties relating to the results of operations  dependence on its major customers  risks associated with rapid technological change and the emerging services market  potential fluctuations in quarterly results  and its dependence on key employees and other risks and uncertainties affecting the technology industry generally 
the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update publicly these forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise
