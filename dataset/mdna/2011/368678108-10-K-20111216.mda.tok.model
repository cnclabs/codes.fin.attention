overview gencor industries  inc  the company is a leading manufacturer of heavy machinery used in the production of highway construction materials  synthetic fuels  and environmental control equipment 
the company s core products include asphalt plants  combustion systems and fluid heat transfer systems 
the company s products are manufactured in two facilities in the united states 
because the company s products are sold primarily to the highway construction industry  the business is seasonal in nature 
traditionally  the company s customers do not purchase new equipment for shipment during the summer and fall months to avoid disrupting their peak season for highway construction and repair work 
the majority of orders for the company s products are thus received between october and february  with a significant volume of shipments occurring prior to may 
due to the late start in customer orders in fiscal  and as compared to fiscal  the company experienced improved shipments in its third fiscal quarter and into the start of the fourth fiscal quarter 
the principal factors driving demand for the company s products are the overall economic conditions  the level of government funding for domestic highway construction and repair  infrastructure development in emerging economies  the need for spare parts  fluctuations in the price of crude oil liquid asphalt as well as fuel costs  and a trend towards larger plants resulting from industry consolidation 
in august  the federal government passed the safe  accountable  flexible and efficient transportation equity act a legacy for users safetea lu 
this bill appropriated a multi year guaranteed funding of billion for federal highway  transit and safety programs that expired on september  on february   president obama signed into law the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra  which included approximately billion for highway and bridge construction activities 
the arra and any future legislation approved by congress could reduce infrastructure funding levels 
in addition  funding restrictions can be imposed on states that do not comply with certain federal policies 
on march   president obama signed into law the hiring incentives to restore employment hire act 
this law extended authorization of the surface transportation programs previously funded under safetea lu through december  at levels 
in addition  the hire act authorized a one time transfer of billion from the general fund to the highway trust fund related to previously foregone interest payments 
on december   president obama signed into law the continuing appropriations and surface transportation extensions act  extending funding for federal surface transportation programs authorized under safetea lu through march  on march   president obama signed into law the surface transportation extension act of providing an extension of federal aid highway  transit and other programs funded out of the highway trust fund through september  on september   obama signed an eighth extension of safetea lu which authorizes funding at levels through march   pending enactment of a multi year law reauthorizing such programs 
although these extensions help stabilize the federal highway program  the company believes a new multiyear highway program would have the greatest positive impact on the road construction industry and allow its customers to plan and execute longer term projects 

table of contents in january  the canadian government announced its economic action plan to stimulate economic growth which included a billion two year investment in new infrastructure including roads  bridges and other infrastructure 
the company s financial performance over the past two years has benefited from programs associated with this funding 
the economic downturn over the past several years and the lack of a multiyear federal highway bill have resulted in reduced purchasing within the company s served markets and thus have had a direct impact on sales and pricing pressures on the company s products resulting in lower pricing and margins 
the company s typical sales of asphalt plants are in the to million range and may require the company s customers to obtain financing 
on the positive side  the reduced value of the us dollar has resulted in more interest and continued sales from international markets 
in addition to government funding and the overall economic conditions  fluctuations in the price of oil  which is a major component of asphalt mix  may affect the company s financial performance 
an increase in the price of oil increases the cost of liquid asphalt and could therefore decrease demand for asphalt and certain of the company s products 
the increase in oil prices over the past year has also driven up the cost of gasoline which has resulted in increased freight costs 
where possible  the company will pass these increased freight costs onto its customers 
however  the company may not be able to recapture all of the increased costs and thus which could have a negative impact on the company s financial performance 
the magnitude of that impact cannot be determined 
steel is a major component used in manufacturing the company s equipment 
during the first nine months of fiscal  the company has experienced increases in prices for the steel beam and plate used in its products 
where possible  the company will pass these increased steel costs onto its customers 
however  the company may not be able to recapture all of the increased steel costs and thus its financial results could be negatively affected 
for the long term  the company believes the strategy of continuing to invest in product engineering and development and its focus on delivering a high quality product and superior service will strengthen the company s market position when demand for its products rebound 
in response to the short term outlook  the company has taken aggressive actions to conserve cash  right size it s operations and cost structure  and will continue to do so based on its forecasts 
these actions included adjustments to workforce and staffing  reduced purchases of raw materials and reductions in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
the company continues to review its internal processes to identify inefficiencies and cost reductions and will continue scrutinizing its relationships with external suppliers to ensure the company is achieving the highest quality products and services at the most competitive cost

gross margin dollars increased in due to the higher revenues

critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions the company believes the following discussion addresses it s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
accounting policies  in addition to the critical accounting policies referenced below  are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements  accounting policies 
estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company uses certain estimates and assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures

assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated events may occur 
the company is subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from estimated results 
revenues expenses revenues from contracts for the design  manufacture and sale of asphalt plants are recognized under the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method of accounting for these contracts recognizes revenue  net of any promotional discounts  and costs in proportion to actual labor costs incurred as compared with total estimated labor costs expected to be incurred during the entire contract 
pre contract costs are expensed as incurred 
changes to total estimated contract costs or losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which they are determined 
revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed is classified as current assets under costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings 
the company anticipates that all incurred costs associated with these contracts at september   will be billed and collected within one year 
revenues from all other contracts for the design and manufacture of custom equipment  for service and for parts sales  net of any discounts and return allowances  are recorded when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met product is delivered or service is performed  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured

provision is made for any anticipated contract losses in the period that the loss becomes evident 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by performing a specific review of all account balances greater than days past due and other higher risk amounts to determine collectability and also adjusting for any known customer payment issues with account balances in the less than day past due aging buckets 
account balances are charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when they are determined to be uncollectable 
any recoveries of account balances previously considered in the allowance for doubtful accounts reduce future additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts
