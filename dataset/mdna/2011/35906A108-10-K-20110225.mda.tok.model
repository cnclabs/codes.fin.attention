the following information is unaudited and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report 
we have no obligation to update or revise these forward looking statements and do not undertake to do so 
expected cost savings resulting from the merger based on current estimates and assumptions  we expect to achieve significant cost savings as a result of the merger  principally by leveraging the scalability of our existing corporate administrative functions and information technology and network systems to cover certain former acquired business functions and systems and by internalizing certain functions formerly provided by third party service providers to the acquired business 
we estimate that our annualized cost savings will reach approximately million by the end of as we implement a targeted list of initiatives 
during  we realized cost savings of approximately million from this target list  primarily by the elimination of costs related to the previous owner centralized services applicable to the acquired business  in addition to a number of other cost reduction initiatives like the elimination of outside contractors 
our fourth quarter savings from the targeted initiatives list was approximately million and equates to an annualized run rate of approximately million 
we expect to achieve annualized cost savings of approximately million by the end of and million by the end of the realization of the additional annual cost savin gs is expected to be fully achieved by the end of  when the acquired business s network and information technology systems and processes will be fully integrated with those of frontier 
the foregoing future cost savings are based on our estimates and assumptions that  although we consider them reasonable  are inherently uncertain 
these expected cost savings are subject to significant business  economic  competitive and regulatory uncertainties and contingencies  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control 
see forward looking statements above 
as a result  there can be no assurance that these or any other cost savings or synergies will actually be realized 
frontier communications corporation and subsidiaries a liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents aggregating million excluding restricted cash of million  representing funds set aside for future broadband expansion and service quality initiatives 
our primary source of funds continued to be cash generated from operations 
for the year ended december   we used cash flow from operations and cash on hand to fund all of our cash investing and financing activities 
at december   we had a working capital deficiency of million 
we believe our operating cash flows  existing cash balances  and new revolving credit facility will be adequate to finance our working capital requirements  fund capital expenditures  make required debt payments  pay taxes  pay dividends to our stockholders in accordance with our dividend policy  pay our acquisition and integration costs and capital expenditures  and support our short term and long term operating strategies through however  a number of factors  including but not limited to  losses of access lines  pricing pressure from increased competition  lower subsidy and switched access revenues and the impact of the current economic environment are expected to reduce our cash generated from operations 
in addition  altho ugh we believe  based on information available to us  that the financial institutions syndicated under our revolving credit facility would be able to fulfill their commitments to us  given the current economic environment  this could change in the future 
further  our below investment grade credit ratings may also make it more difficult and expensive to refinance our maturing debt 
as of december   we have approximately million and million of debt maturing in and  respectively 
the consummation of the transaction resulted in a combined company with significantly larger business operations and  consequently  greater working capital  capital expenditure and other liquidity needs 
upon consummation of the transaction  we assumed approximately billion principal amount of debt 
as a result of our greater liquidity requirements  we entered into a new revolving credit facility which increased our line of credit to million to provide sufficient flexibility to meet our liquidity needs 
based on the level of debt incurred and the additional cash flows resulting from the transaction  our capacity to service our debt has been significantly enhanced as compared to our capacity immediately prior to the merger  although our overall debt increased 
at december   the ratio of our net debt to adjusted operating cash flow leverage ratio was times 
in addition  the fcc and certain state regulatory commissions  in connection with granting their approvals of the transaction  specified certain capital expenditure and operating requirements for our business for specified periods of time post closing 
these requirements focus primarily on certain capital investment commitments to three state regulatory commissions to expand broadband availability and speeds to at least of the households throughout the acquired territories with minimum speeds of mbps by the end of and mbps by the end of to satisfy all or part of certain capital investment commitments  we placed an aggregate amount of million in cash into escrow accounts and obtained a letter of credit for million in the third quarter of another million of cash in an escrow account  with an a ssociated liability for the same amount  was acquired in connection with the merger to be used for service quality initiatives in the state of west virginia 
the aggregate amount of these escrow accounts and the letter of credit will decrease over time as frontier makes the required capital expenditures in the respective states 
the transaction provides for a post closing calculation of working capital 
frontier and verizon have not finalized the results of this calculation nor the post closing adjustment  if any 
the final resolution of this process will not negatively impact frontier s balance sheet or working capital 
cash flow provided by operating activities cash flow provided by operating activities improved million  or  in as compared to the improvement was primarily the result of incremental cash flow from the acquired business 
cash paid for taxes was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our cash taxes were lower than due to the impact of bonus depreciation in accordance with the tax relief act 
we expect that in our cash taxes will be approximately million to million 
our cash tax estimate reflects the continued impact of bonus depreciation under the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization  and job creation act of frontier communications corporation and subsidiaries in connection with the transaction  the company undertook activities to plan and implement information systems conversions and other initiatives necessary to effectuate the merger  which occurred on july  as a result  the company incurred million of acquisition and integration costs related to integration activities during cash flow used by investing activities acquisitions on july   frontier issued common shares with a value of billion and made payments of million in cash as consideration for the acquired business 
in addition  as part of the transaction  frontier assumed approximately billion in debt 
capital expenditures in  and  our capital expenditures were million including million of integration related capital expenditures  million including million of integration related capital expenditures and million  respectively 
capital expenditures in included million associated with the acquired business 
we continue to closely scrutinize all of our capital projects  emphasize return on investment and focus our capital expenditures on areas and services that have the greatest opportunities with respect to revenue growth and cost reduction 
we anticipate total capital expenditures of approximately million to million for related to our frontier legacy properties and the acquired business 
in connection with the transaction  the company undertook activities to plan and implement systems conversions and other initiatives necessary to effectuate the closing  which occurred on july  as a result  the company incurred million and million of capital expenditures related to these integration activities in and  respectively 
cash flow used by and provided from financing activities issuance of debt securities on april   and in anticipation of the merger  the verizon subsidiary then holding the assets of the acquired business completed a private offering of billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes 
the gross proceeds of the offering  plus million the transaction escrow contributed by frontier  were deposited into an escrow account 
immediately prior to the merger  the proceeds of the notes offering less the initial purchasers discount were released from the escrow account and used to make a special cash payment to verizon  as contemplated by the transaction  with amounts in excess of the special cash payment and the initial purchasers discount received by the company approximately million 
in addition  the million transaction escrow was returned to the company 
upon completion of the merger  we entered into a supplemental indenture with the bank of new york mellon  as trustee  pursuant to which we assumed the obligations under the senior notes 
the senior notes consist of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the notes  billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the notes  billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the notes and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the notes 
the notes have an interest rate of per annum  the notes have an interest rate of per annum  the notes have an interest rate of per annum and the notes have an interest rate of per annum 
the senior notes were issued at a price equal to of their face value

we used the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase outstanding debt  as described below 
on march   we borrowed million under a senior unsecured term loan facility that was established on march  the loan matures in and bears interest based on the prime rate or london interbank offered rate libor  at our election  plus a margin which varies depending on our debt leverage ratio 
we used the proceeds to repurchase  during the first quarter of  million principal amount of the notes and to pay for the million of premium on early retirement of those notes

during the fourth quarter of  the company purchased and retired  in accordance with the terms of the tender offer referred to above  approximately million aggregate principal amount of the notes and approximately million aggregate principal amount of the notes 
the aggregate consideration for these debt repurchases was million  which was financed with the proceeds of the october debt offering and a portion of the proceeds of the april debt offering  each as described above 
the repurchases in the tender offer resulted in a loss on the early retirement of debt of approximately million  which we recognized in the fourth quarter of in addition to the debt tender offer  we used million of the april debt offering proceeds to repurchase in million principal amount of debt  consisting of million of the notes  million of our senior notes due january   million of the notes  million of our senior notes due march  and million of our debentures due august  an additional million net gain was recognized and included in other income loss  net in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  as a result of these other debt repurchases

a letter of credit for million was issued to the west virginia public service commission to guarantee certain of our capital investment commitments in west virginia in connection with the transaction 
frontier communications corporation and subsidiaries credit facility on march   we entered into a million revolving credit facility the credit facility that became effective on july   concurrently with the closing of the merger and the termination of the company s previously existing revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had not made any borrowings utilizing this facility 
the terms of the credit facility are set forth in the credit agreement  dated as of march   among the company  the lenders party thereto  and jpmorgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent the credit agreement 
associated facility fees under the credit facility will vary from time to time depending on the company s credit rating as defined in the credit agreement and were per annum as of december  the credit facility is scheduled to terminate on janua ry  during the term of the credit facility  the company may borrow  repay and reborrow funds  and may obtain letters of credit  subject to customary borrowing conditions

frontier communications corporation and subsidiaries off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements  transactions  obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial statements 
future commitments a summary of our future contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  is as follows contractual obligations in thousands payment due by period total thereafter long term debt obligations  excluding interest interest on long term debt operating lease obligations purchase obligations liability for uncertain tax positions total at december   we have outstanding performance letters of credit totaling million 
critical accounting policies and estimates we review all significant estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and record the effect of any necessary adjustment prior to their publication 
uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements  accordingly  it is possible that actual results could differ from those estimates and changes to estimates could occur in the near term 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
estimates and judg ments are used when accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets  impairment of intangible assets  depreciation and amortization  pension and other postretirement benefits  income taxes  contingencies and purchase price allocations  among others 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to such estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for estimated bad debts based on our estimate of our ability to collect accounts receivable through a review of aging categories and specific customer accounts 
in and  we had no critical estimates related to bankruptcies of telecommunications companies or any other customers 
asset impairment we review long lived assets to be held and used and long lived assets to be disposed of  including customer lists  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
recoverability of assets held for sale is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to their estimated fair market value 
if any assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value 
also  we periodically reassess the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets to determine whether any changes are required 
in and  we had no critical estimates related to asset impairments 
frontier communications corporation and subsidiaries intangibles our indefinite lived intangibles consist of goodwill and trade name  which resulted from the purchase of ilec properties 
we test for impairment of these assets annually  or more frequently  as circumstances warrant 
we test for goodwill impairment at the operating segment level  as that term is defined in us gaap 
as of july  and as a result of the completion of the transaction  our operating segments reporting units increased from at december  to effective as of july  
this structure is consistent with how our chief operating decision makers ceo  cfo  coo review our results on a daily  weekly and monthly basis 
after making the change in our operating segments  we reviewed our goodwill impairment test by comparing the ebitda multiples for ea ch reporting unit to their carrying values noting that no impairment indicator was present 
no potential impairment was indicated and no further analysis was deemed necessary 
all of our ilec properties share similar economic characteristics and as a result  we aggregate our five operating segments into one reportable segment 
each of the below noted reporting units is an operating segment 
the first step in the goodwill impairment test compares the carrying value of net assets of the reporting unit to its fair value 
in determining fair value of goodwill at december   we compared the net book value of the reporting units to current trading multiples of ilec properties as well as reconciled these values to the trading values of our publicly traded common stock 
additionally  we utilized a range of prices to gauge sensitivity 
the result of this first step indicated that fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of such r eporting units 
as a result  the second step of the goodwill impairment test was not required 
goodwill by reporting unit operating segment at december  is as follows reporting units in thousands northeast southeast west central midwest goodwill prior to the transaction  and the related increase in operating segments  we reorganized our management and operating structure during the first quarter of to include our rochester market with our existing new york state properties and the rest of the east region 
at that time  we determined that no impairment was indicated at both december  and march  for either the east or rochester reporting units and combining them did not alter the conclusion at either date 
we estimate fair value in two ways marketplace company comparison based and equity based utilizing our share price 
enterprise values for rural ilec properties are typically quoted as a multiple of cash flow or ebitda 
marketplace company comparisons and analyst reports support a range of values around a multiple of to times annualized ebitda 
for the purpose of the goodwill impairment test we define ebitda as operating income plus depreciation and amortization 
we determined the fair value estimates using times ebitda but also used lower ebitda multiples to gauge the sensitivity of the estimate and its effect on the margin of excess of fair value over the carrying values of the reporting units 
additionally  a second test was performed using our public market equity value or market capitalization 
market capitalization current market stock price times total shares outstanding is a public market indicator of equity value and is useful in corroborating the times ebitda valuation because we are singularly engaged in rural ilec operating activities 
our stock price on december  was and when compared to the fair value using the ebitda multiple obtained above  exceeded such value before consideration of any applicable control premium 
we also used lower per share stock prices to gauge the sensitivity of the estimate and its effect on the margin of excess fair value over the carrying value 
total market capitalization determined in this manner is then allocated to the reporting units based upon each unit s relative share of consolidated ebitda 
our method of determining fair value has been consistently applied for the three years ending december  depreciation and amortization the calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic useful lives of the underlying property  plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets 
an independent study updating the estimated remaining useful lives of our property  plant and equipment assets is performed annually 
we revised our useful lives for frontier legacy plant assets  and the plant assets of the acquired business  based on the study effective october  for the plant assets of the acquired business  an independent study was performed to develop the appropriate depreciation rates based on frontier existing rates  while also incorporating factors unique to the plant assets of the acquired business 
the composite depreciation rate for our plant assets is as a result of the study 
intangible assets acquired in the transaction were recorded based on an estimated fair value of billion and an estimated useful life of nine years for the residential customer list  as distinguished from the years used for the business customer list 
for both classes of assets  the sum of the years digits method was used to amortize the intangible assets  which tracks more closely with the projected revenue stream of each asset class 
our frontier legacy customer list intangible assets do not distinguish between residential and business classes and the amortization period is five years on the straight line method 
we periodically reassess the useful life of our intangible assets to determine whether any changes to those lives are required 
we anticipate depreciation expense of approximately million to million and amortization expense of approximately million for frontier communications corporation and subsidiaries pension and other postretirement benefits our estimates of pension expense  other postretirement benefits including retiree medical benefits and related liabilities are critical accounting estimates 
in connection with the completion of the merger on july   certain employees were transferred from various verizon pension plans into pension plans that were then merged with the frontier communications pension plan the plan effective august  assets of million  including approximately million that represents a receivable of the plan as of december   were transferred into the plan during the second half of  with the receivable to be settled by the transfer of assets by the end of the third quarter of we sponsor a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering a significant num ber of our current and former frontier legacy employees and other postretirement benefit plans that provide medical  dental  life insurance and other benefits for covered retired employees and their beneficiaries and covered dependents 
all of the employees who are still accruing pension benefits are represented employees 
the accounting results for pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions applied in the determination of such amounts 
these actuarial assumptions include the following discount rates  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  future compensation increases  employee turnover  healthcare cost trend rates  expected retirement age  optional form of benefit and mortality 
we review these assumptions for changes annually with our independent actuaries 
we consider our discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets to be our most critical assumptions 
the discount rate is used to value  on a present value basis  our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as of the balance sheet date 
the same rate is also used in the interest cost component of the pension and postretirement benefit cost determination for the following year 
the measurement date used in the selection of our discount rate is the balance sheet date 
our discount rate assumption is determined annually with assistance from our actuaries based on the pattern of expected future benefit payments and the prevailing rates available on long term  high quality corporate bonds that approximate the benefit obligation 
in making this determination we consider  among other things  the yields on the citigroup pension discount curve  the citigroup above median pension curve  t he towers watson index  the general movement of interest rates and the changes in those rates from one period to the next 
this rate can change from year to year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields 
our discount rate was at year end  and at year end the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is applied in the determination of periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost as a reduction in the computation of the expense 
in developing the expected long term rate of return assumption  we considered published surveys of expected market returns  and year actual returns of various major indices  and our own historical year  year and year investment returns 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of to in fixed income securities  to in equity securities and to in alternative investments 
we review our asset allocation at least annually and make changes when considered appropriate 
our asset return assumption is made at the beginning of ou r fiscal year 
in and  our expected long term rate of return on plan assets was 
our actual return on plan assets in was 
for  we will continue to assume a rate of return of 
our pension plan assets are valued at fair value as of the measurement date 
we expect that our pension and other postretirement benefit expenses for will be approximately million to million before amounts capitalized into the cost of capital expenditures they were million in before amounts capitalized into the cost of capital expenditures  including the plan expenses of the acquired business for the second half of  and that we will make a cash contribution to our pension plan of approximately million in we made cash contributions of million in no contributions were made to our pension plan during or income taxes our effective tax rate in increased to  primarily related to the write off of certain deferred tax assets of approximately million related to merger transaction costs which were not tax deductible 
prior to the closing of the merger  these costs were deemed to be tax deductible as the transaction had not yet been successfully completed 
these costs were incurred to facilitate the merger and once the merger closed  these costs must be capitalized for tax purposes 
our effective tax rates in and were approximately at the statutory rates 
contingencies we currently do not have any contingencies in excess of million recorded on our books  except for items preliminarily estimated in purchase accounting 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
frontier communications corporation and subsidiaries purchase price allocation the transaction the allocation of the approximate billion in total consideration to the fair market value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired business is a critical estimate 
the estimates of the fair values assigned to plant  customer list and goodwill  are more fully described in notes  and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
additionally  the estimated expected life of a customer used to amortize the customer list is a critical estimate 
new accounting pronouncements there were no new accounting standards that were adopted by the company in  or that would be adopted in future years  with any material financial statement impact 
frontier communications corporation and subsidiaries b results of operations effective july   the company s scope of operations and balance sheet capitalization changed materially as a result of the completion of the transaction 
historical financial and operating data presented for frontier is not indicative of future results and includes the results of operations of the acquired business from the date of acquisition on july  the financial discussion and tables below include a comparative analysis of our results of operations on a historical basis for our frontier operations as of and for the years ended december   and we have also presented an analysis of each category of revenue and operating expenses for for the results of frontier legacy operations excluding the acquired business and the results of the acquired business for the second half of  as included in the consolidated results of operations 
all variance explanations discussed below are based upon an analysis of the financial data for frontier legacy operations excluding the acquired business in comparison to  except that the first two sentences in each category of revenue or operating expenses below shows the revenue  operating expenses and or variances based upon an analysis of frontier including the acquired business 
frontier has shown these adjustments to its financial presentations to exclude the effects of the acquired business because of the magnitude of the transaction and its impact to our financial results in  as compared to revenue revenue is generated primarily through the provision of local  network access  long distance  and data and internet services 
such revenues are generated through either a monthly recurring fee or a fee based on usage at a tariffed rate and revenue recognition is not dependent upon significant judgments by management  with the exception of a determination of a provision for uncollectible amounts 
consolidated revenue for increased  million  or  to  million as compared to excluding additional revenue of  million attributable to the acquired business  our revenue decreased million  or as compared to revenues from data and internet services such as hsi grew and increased for our frontier legacy properties as a percentage of total revenues and revenues from voice services like local and long distance services and from switched access and subsidy including federal and state subsidies declined and decreased as a percentage of our total revenues 
this decline for our frontier legacy operations in is a result of decreases in the number of residential and business customers  switched access revenue  long distance services revenue and directory revenue  pa rtially offset by a million  or  increase in data and internet services revenue  each as described in more detail below 
consolidated revenue for decreased million  or  to  million as compared to this decline is a result of lower local services revenue  switched access revenue  long distance services revenue and subsidy revenue  partially offset by a million  or  increase in data and internet services revenue  each as described in more detail below 
change in the number of our access lines is one metric that is important to our revenue and profitability 
our frontier legacy operations lost access lines primarily because of changing consumer behavior including wireless substitution  economic conditions  changing technology  competition  and by the loss of second lines upon the addition of hsi or cable modem service 
our frontier legacy operations lost approximately  access lines net during  or on an annual basis  comparable to the  access lines net  or on an annual basis  lost during the acquired business lost approximately  access lines net during the six months ended december  economic conditions and or increasing competition could make it more difficult to sell our bundles  and cause us to increase our promotions and or lowe r our prices for our products and services  which would adversely affect our revenue  profitability and cash flow 
during  our frontier legacy operations added approximately  hsi subscribers 
during  we added approximately  hsi subscribers  primarily due to our rolling thunder promotion 
the acquired business experienced a loss of approximately  hsi subscribers during the six months ended december  we expect to continue to increase hsi subscribers in our frontier legacy operations in and expect to increase the number of hsi subscribers in the acquired business during while the number of access lines is an important metric to gauge certain revenue trends  it is not necessarily the best or only measure to evaluate our business 
management believes that customer counts and understanding different components of revenue is most important 
for this reason  presented in the table titled other financial and operating data below is a breakdown that presents customer counts  average monthly revenue  products per customer  percentage of customers on price protection plans and churn 
it also categorizes revenue into customer revenue residential and business and regulatory revenue switched access and subsidy revenue 
despite the decline in residential customers and the decline in total access lines  customer revenue  which is all revenue except switched access and subsidy revenue  for our frontier legacy operations declined in by only percent as compared to the prior year period 
the decline in customers and access lines for our frontier legacy operations was partially offset by increased penetration of additional products sold to both residential and business customers  which has increased our average monthly revenue per customer 
a substantial further loss of customers and access lines  combined with increased competition and the other factors discussed herein may cause our revenue  profitability and cash flows to decrease in other financial and operating data as of increase as of as of increase as of december  decrease july  december  decrease december  access lines residential business total access lines hsi subscribers video subscribers for the year ended december  increase increase increase increase decrease decrease decrease decrease revenue in s residential business total customer revenue regulatory switched access and subsidy total revenue switched access minutes of use in millions average monthly total revenue per access line frontier legacy average monthly customer revenue per access line frontier legacy as of or for the as of or for the as of or for the year ended increase year ended increase year ended december  decrease december  decrease december  residential customer metrics customers revenue in s products per residential customer frontier legacy average monthly residential revenue per customer frontier legacy percent of customers on price protection plans frontier legacy customer monthly churn frontier legacy business customer metrics customers revenue in s average monthly business revenue per customer frontier legacy products per residential customer primary residential voice line  hsi and video products have a value of long distance  frontier peace of mind  second lines  feature packages and dial up have a value of frontier communications corporation and subsidiaries revenue in thousands as acquired frontier increase increase increase increase reported business legacy decrease decrease amount decrease decrease amount local and long distance services data and internet services switched access and subsidy directory services other local and long distance services local and long distance services revenue for increased million  or  to  million  as compared with local and long distance services revenue for increased million as a result of the acquired business

long distance services revenue for our frontier legacy operations for increased million as compared with  primarily due to an increase in the number of long distance customers using our bundled service offerings partially offset by lower minutes of use and a lower average revenue per minute of use 
we have actively marketed a package of unlimited long distance minutes with our digital phone and state unlimited bundled service offerings 
these offerings have resulted in an increase in long distance customers and an increase in the minutes used by these customers 
this has lowered our overall average rate per minute billed

on march   the fcc released  as required under the american recovery and reinvestment act arra  its national broadband plan 
the national broadband plan proposes a series of actions that could result in additional regulatory requirements for broadband services as well as a series of other regulatory reforms 
as a follow up to the national broadband plan  on february   the fcc adopted a notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment from the industry on both short and long term reforms to intercarrier compensation and the federal universal service high cost fund 
the notice asks for comment on a broad range of possible outcomes and frontier cannot predict whether or when the fcc will take additional actions or the effect of any such actions on the company s subsidy revenues

subsidy revenue  including surcharges billed to customers of million  for of million decreased million  or  as compared with  primarily due to lower receipts under the federal high cost fund fhcf program resulting from o ur reduced cost structure and an increase in the program s national average cost per local loop nacpl used by the fcc to allocate funds among all recipients 
federal and state subsidy revenue including surcharges which are billed to customers and remitted to the fcc were million  million and million  respectively  for the federal and state subsidy revenue for represents of our consolidated revenues 
federal subsidies are driven by many factors  including the nacpl 
many factors may lead to further increases in the nacpl  thereby resulting in decreases in our federal subsidy revenue in the future 
the fcc and state regulatory agencies are currently considering a number of proposals for changing the manner in which eligibility for subsidies is determined as well as the amounts of such subsidies 
in addition  some of the reform proposals direct additional support for broadband deployment which could create an opportunity for additional federal subsidy support 
certain states also have their own open proceedings to address reform to intrastate access charges and other intercarrier compensation 
in addition  we have been approached by  and or are involved in formal state proceedings with  various carriers seeking reductions in intrastate access rates in certain states 
we cannot predict when or how these matters will be decided or the effect on our subsidy or switched access revenues 
however  future reductions in our subsidy or switched access revenues will directly affect our profitability and cash flows as those regulatory revenues do not have an equal level of associated variable expenses

frontier communications corporation and subsidiaries item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk disclosure of primary market risks and how they are managed we are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to ongoing investing and funding activities  including those associated with our pension assets 
market risk refers to the potential change in fair value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and equity prices 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
as a result  we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to market risks  and we are not party to any market risk management agreements other than in the normal course of business 
our primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk and equity price risk as follows interest rate exposure our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the interest bearing portion of our investment portfolio 
our long term debt as of december  was approximately fixed rate debt with minimal exposure to interest rate changes 
we had no interest rate swap agreements related to our fixed rate debt in effect at december  and our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  all but million of our outstanding borrowings at december  have fixed interest rates 
in addition  our undrawn million revolving credit facility has interest rates that float with libor  as defined 
consequently  we have limited material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on our long term debt 
an adverse change in interest rates would increase the amount that we pay on our variable obligations and could result in fluctuations in the fair value of our fixed rate obligations 
based upon our overall interest rate exposure at december   a near term change in interest rates would not materially affect our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
sensitivity analysis of interest rate exposure at december   the fair value of our long term debt was estimated to be approximately billion  based on our overall weighted average borrowing rate of and our overall weighted average maturity of approximately years 
as of december   the weighted average maturity applicable to our obligations has been reduced from the weighted average maturity as of december  by approximately years due to the billion of debt that was assumed by frontier upon consummation of the transaction 
equity price exposure our exposure to market risks for changes in security prices as of december  is limited to our pension assets 
we have no other security investments of any material amount 
during and  the diminished availability of credit and liquidity in the united states and throughout the global financial system resulted in substantial volatility in financial markets and the banking system 
these and other economic events have had an adverse impact on investment portfolios 
the decline in the value of our pension plan assets during resulted in an increase in our pension expense in and the company s pension plan assets have increased from million at december  to  million at december   an increase of million  or 
this increase is a result of asset transfers from the verizon pension plan trusts of million  including approximately million that represents a receivable of the plan as of december   less ongoing benefit payments of million  offset by million of positive investment returns and cash contributions of million during we expect that we will make cash contributions to our pension plan of approximately million in frontier communications corporation and subsidiaries
