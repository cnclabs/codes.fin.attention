item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors  including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview recent developments revenues for fiscal were billion  with net income of billion  which were impacted by the following key items we shipped approximately million mobile station modem msm integrated circuits for cdma and ofdma based wireless devices  an increase of  compared to approximately million msm integrated circuits in fiscal total reported device sales were approximately billion  an increase of approximately  compared to approximately billion in fiscal on may   we acquired atheros communications  inc  which was renamed qualcomm atheros  inc atheros  for total cash consideration of billion  net of cash acquired  and the exchange of equity awards 
atheros was integrated into the qualcomm cdma technologies qct segment 
we executed a restructuring plan under which the flo tv business and network were shut down  and we are no longer pursing our mediaflo technologies business 
we recorded net restructuring and restructuring related charges of million in fiscal our results of operations reflect the presentation of the flo tv business as discontinued operations  and all prior period amounts have been adjusted accordingly 
against this backdrop  the following recent developments occurred during fiscal with respect to key elements of our business or our industry worldwide wireless connections grew by approximately to reach approximately billion 
worldwide g connections all cdma based grew to approximately billion  approximately of total wireless connections  including approximately million cdma x xev do connections and approximately million wcdma hspa td scdma connections 
unit shipments of cdma based handsets grew an estimated year over year  compared to an estimated increase of year over year across all wireless technologies 
during fiscal  some customers built devices that incorporated two msms 
in such cases  which represent less than of our gross volume  we count only one msm in reporting the msm shipments 
total reported device sales is the sum of all reported sales in us dollars as reported to us by our licensees of all licensed cdma based subscriber devices including handsets  modules  modem cards and other subscriber devices by our licensees during a particular period 
not all licensees report sales the same way eg  some licensees report sales net of permitted deductions  such as transportation  insurance and packing costs  while other licensees report sales and then identify the amount of permitted deductions in their reports  and the way in which licensees report such information may change from time to time 
total reported device sales for a particular period may include prior period activity that was not reported by the licensee until such particular period 
according to wireless intelligence estimates as of october   for the quarter ending september  wireless intelligence estimates for cdma x xev do connections do not include wireless local loop 
based on current reports by strategy analytics  a global research and consulting firm  in their august global handset market share update 
our business and operating segments we design  manufacture  have manufactured on our behalf and market digital communications products and services based on cdma  ofdma and other technologies 
we derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products  fixed license fees payable in one or more installments and ongoing royalties for use of our intellectual property  messaging and other services and related hardware sales  software development and licensing and related services and software hosting services 
operating expenses primarily consist of cost of equipment and services  research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses 
we conduct business primarily through four reportable segments 
these segments are qualcomm cdma technologies  or qct  qualcomm technology licensing  or qtl  qualcomm wireless internet  or qwi  and qualcomm strategic initiatives  or qsi 
qct is a leading developer and supplier of integrated circuits and system software based on cdma  ofdma and other technologies for use in voice and data communications  networking  application processing  multimedia and global positioning system products 
qct s integrated circuit products and system software are sold to or licensed to manufacturers that use our products in wireless devices  particularly mobile phones  tablets  laptops  data modules  handheld wireless computers and gaming devices  access points and routers  data cards and infrastructure equipment  and in wired devices  particularly broadband gateway equipment  desktop computers  televisions and blu ray players 
the msm integrated circuits  which include the mobile data modem  qualcomm single chip and qualcomm snapdragon devices  perform the core baseband modem functionality in wireless devices providing voice and data communications  as well as multimedia applications and global positioning functions 
in addition  our snapdragon enabled integrated circuits provide advanced application processing capabilities 
qct s system software enables the other device components to interface with the integrated circuit products and is the foundation software enabling manufacturers to develop devices utilizing the functionality within the integrated circuits 
qct revenues comprised  and of total consolidated revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
qct utilizes a fabless production business model  which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made 
integrated circuits are die  cut from silicon wafers  that have been assembled into packages or modules and have completed the final test manufacturing processes 
we rely on independent third party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly  and most of the testing  of our integrated circuits 
our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits 
we employ both turnkey and two stage manufacturing business models to purchase our integrated circuits 
turnkey is when our foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits 
under the two stage manufacturing business model  we purchase wafers and die from semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract with separate third party manufacturers for probe  assembly and final test services 
qtl grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio  which includes certain patent rights essential to and or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products  including  without limitation  products implementing cdmaone  cdma  wcdma  cdma tdd including td scdma  gsm gprs edge and or ofdma standards and their derivatives 
qtl licensing revenues are comprised of license fees as well as royalties based on worldwide sales by licensees of products incorporating or using our intellectual property 
license fees are fixed amounts paid in one or more installments 
royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale ie  licensee s selling price of licensed products  net of certain permissible deductions eg  certain shipping costs  packing costs  vat  etc qtl revenues comprised  and of total consolidated revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the vast majority of such revenues were generated through our licensees sales of cdmaone  cdma and wcdma subscriber equipment products 
qwi  which includes qualcomm enterprise services qes  qualcomm internet services qis  qualcomm government technologies qgov and firethorn  generates revenues primarily through mobile information products and services and software and software development aimed at support and delivery of wireless applications 
qes sells equipment  software and services used by transportation and other companies to connect wirelessly with their assets and workforce 
through september  qes has shipped approximately  terrestrial based and satellite based mobile information units 
qis provides content enablement services for the wireless industry  including brew  the plaza suite and other services 
qis also provides qchat push to talk and other products for wireless operators 
qgov provides development  hardware  analytical expertise and services involving wireless communications technologies to united states government agencies 
firethorn builds and manages software applications that enable mobile commerce services 
qwi revenues comprised  and of total consolidated revenues fiscal  and  respectively 
qsi makes strategic investments that we believe will open new opportunities for our technologies  support the design and introduction of new products and services for voice and data communications or possess unique capabilities or technology 
many of these strategic investments are in early stage companies 
qsi also holds wireless spectrum 
as part of our strategic investment activities  we intend to pursue various exit strategies at some point in the future 
the results of qsi s flo tv business is presented as discontinued operations 
since the shut down of the flo tv business and network on march   we have been working to sell our remaining assets and exit contracts 
on december   we announced that we have agreed to sell substantially all of our mhz spectrum for billion  subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions  including approval by the us fcc 
nonreportable segments include the qualcomm mems technologies division  which continues to develop an imod display technology based on micro electro mechanical system mems structure combined with thin film optics  and other product initiatives 
discontinued operations on december   we agreed to sell substantially all of our mhz spectrum for billion  subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions  including approval by the us federal communications commission fcc 
the agreement terminates on january   however  either party can extend the agreement for another days thereafter if the fcc approval has not been received by then 
the agreement followed our previously announced plan to restructure and evaluate strategic options related to the flo tv business and network 
the flo tv business and network were shut down on march  since then  we have been working to sell the remaining assets and exit contracts 
the mhz spectrum with a carrying value of million that we have agreed to sell was classified as held for sale  and all other assets were considered disposed of  at september  accordingly  the results of operations of the flo tv business were presented as discontinued operations at september  loss from discontinued operations includes share based payments and excludes certain general corporate expenses allocated to the flo tv business during the periods presented 
our statements of operations for all prior periods have been adjusted to conform 
summarized results from discontinued operations were as follows in millions year ended september  september  september  revenues loss from discontinued operations income tax benefit discontinued operations  net of income taxes restructuring and restructuring related activities under our plan related to discontinued operations were initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal as we continue to negotiate the exit of certain contracts and remove certain of our equipment from the network sites 
during fiscal  we recorded million in restructuring related charges  primarily consisting of asset impairments and accelerated depreciation  and net restructuring charges of million  including million in contract termination costs 
we estimate that we will incur future restructuring and restructuring related charges of up to million  primarily related to lease exit costs 
we may also realize certain gains  primarily due to the potential release of liabilities associated with ongoing efforts to exit certain contracts  the amount of which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
future cash expenditures are expected to be in the range of million to million 
looking forward the deployment of g networks enables increased voice capacity and higher data rates than prior generation networks  thereby supporting more minutes of use and a wide range of mobile broadband data applications for handsets  g connected computing devices and other consumer electronics 
many wireless operators have or are planning to complement their existing g networks by deploying ofdma based technology  often called g  in new spectrum to gain additional capacity for data services 
as a result  we expect continued growth in the coming years in consumer demand for g and g g multimode products and services around the world 
in addition  we expect an increasing number of devices  such as computers  consumer electronics and networking equipment  to require multiple communications technologies to support a variety of connected applications 
as we look forward to the next several months  the following items are likely to have an impact on our business the worldwide transition from g to g cdma based networks is expected to continue  including the further expansion of g in china  india and other emerging regions 
we expect consumer demand for advanced g based and g g multimode devices  including smartphones and data centric devices  such as tablets and e readers  to continue at a strong pace 
we also expect growth in lower end g devices as g expands in emerging regions 
we expect that cdma based device prices will continue to vary broadly due to the increased penetration of smartphones combined with active competition throughout the world at all price tiers 
this  along with varying rates of economic growth by region and stronger than average growth in emerging regions  is expected to continue to impact the average and range of selling prices of cdma based devices 
we continue to invest significant resources toward the development of technologies and products for voice and data communications  primarily in the wireless industry  including advancements to g cdma and g lte networks  wireless baseband chips  our converged computing communications snapdragon chips  multimedia products  software and services  as well as our imod display technology 
we have agreed to sell substantially all of our mhz spectrum for billion  subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions  including approval from the us federal communications commission 
if the closing conditions are met  we expect to recognize a gain in discontinued operations of billion 
in addition to the foregoing business and market based matters  we continue to devote resources to working with and educating participants in the wireless value chain as to the benefits of our business model in promoting a highly competitive and innovative wireless industry 
however  we expect that certain companies may continue to be dissatisfied with the need to pay reasonable royalties for the use of our technology and not welcome the success of our business model in enabling new  highly cost effective competitors to their products 
we expect that such companies will continue to challenge our business model in various forums throughout the world 
further discussion of risks related to our business is presented in the risk factors included in this annual report 
revenue concentrations revenues from customers in china  south korea  taiwan and japan comprised   and  respectively  of total consolidated revenues for fiscal  as compared to   and  respectively  for fiscal  and   and  respectively  for fiscal we distinguish revenues from external customers by geographic areas based on the location to which our products  software or services are delivered and  for qtl s licensing and royalty revenues  the invoiced addresses of our licensees 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation of intangible assets and investments  share based payments  income taxes and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 
we believe that the following significant accounting estimates may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products  licensing of our intellectual property and software  and sales of messaging  software hosting  software development and other services and related hardware 
the timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors  including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations 
determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable  but actual results may differ from our estimates 
we license or otherwise provide rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio  which includes certain patent rights essential to and or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products 
licensing revenues include license fees payable in one or more installments and ongoing royalties based on licensees sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property 
license fees are recognized over the estimated period of benefit of the license to the licensee  typically to years 
we recognize royalty revenues based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter and when other revenue recognition criteria are met 
from time to time  licensees will not report royalties timely due to legal disputes or other reasons  and when this occurs  the timing and comparability of royalty revenues could be affected 
valuation of intangible assets and investments 
our business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets  and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future 
we also acquire intangible assets in other types of transactions 
at september   our goodwill and other intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  were billion and billion  respectively 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
for intangible assets purchased in a business combination or received in a non monetary exchange  the estimated fair values of the assets received or  for non monetary exchanges  the estimated fair values of the assets transferred if more clearly evident are used to establish their recorded values  except when neither the values of the assets received or the assets transferred in non monetary exchanges are determinable within reasonable limits 
valuation techniques consistent with the market approach  income approach and or cost approach are used to measure fair value 
an estimate of fair value can be affected by many assumptions that require significant judgment 
for example  the income approach generally requires assumptions related to the appropriate business model to be used to estimate cash flows  total addressable market  pricing and share forecasts  competition  technology obsolescence  future tax rates and discount rates 
our estimate of the fair value of certain assets  or our conclusion that the value of certain assets is not reliably estimable  may differ materially from that determined by others who use different assumptions or utilize different business models 
new information may arise in the future that affects our fair value estimates and could result in adjustments to our estimates in the future  which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying amounts may be impaired 
long lived assets  such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to goodwill and other intangible assets are based on operational performance of our businesses  market conditions and other factors 
although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process  the estimates and assumptions we use  including estimates of future cash flows  volumes  market penetration and discount rates  are consistent with our internal planning 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of our goodwill and other intangible assets 
furthermore  we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
during fiscal  we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge related to our firethorn division due to the operating performance of a new product application falling significantly short of expectations 
we hold investments in marketable securities  including equity securities  non investment grade debt securities  equity and debt mutual and exchange traded funds  corporate bonds and notes  auction rate securities and mortgage and asset backed securities 
the fair value of these investments totaled billion at september   with increases and decreases in fair value generally recorded through stockholders equity as other comprehensive income or loss 
we record impairment charges through the statement of operations when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary 
the determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors 
in addition  the fair values of our strategic investments may be subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to significant market volatility 
adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby requiring impairment charges 
when assessing these investments for an other than temporary decline in value  we consider such factors as  among other things  how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost  how long the market value of the investment has been below its original cost  the extent of the general decline in prices or an increase in the default or recovery rates of securities in an asset class  negative events such as a bankruptcy filing or a need to raise capital or seek financial support from the government or others  the performance and pricing of the investee s securities in relation to the securities of its competitors within the industry and the market in general  and analyst recommendations  as applicable 
we also review the financial statements of the investee to determine if the investee is experiencing financial difficulties 
if we determine that a security price decline is other than temporary  we may record an impairment loss  which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
during fiscal  and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively  in net impairment losses on our investments in marketable securities 
share based compensation 
share based compensation expense recognized during fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
share based compensation is measured at the grant date  or at the acquisition date for assumed awards  based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards granted using a lattice binomial option pricing model and the fair value of stock option awards assumed using the black scholes option pricing model 
accordingly  the fair value of an option award as determined using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price on the valuation date as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rates and expected dividends 
for purposes of estimating the fair value of stock options  we used the implied volatility of market traded options in our stock for the expected volatility assumption input to the option pricing model 
the assumption inputs related to employee exercise behavior include estimates of the post vest forfeiture rate and suboptimal exercise factors  which are based on historical experience 
beginning in fiscal  we began to issue restricted stock units rsus to employees 
since such time  the number of stock options granted to employees has decreased  and we expect this trend to continue into the foreseeable future 
we estimate the fair value of rsus based on the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant or date the awards are assumed 
if rsus do not have the right to participate in dividends  the fair value is discounted by the dividend yield 
judgment is required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience 
to the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate  share based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly 
income taxes 
our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
while we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns  we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision  income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 
although we believe that the estimates and assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable  adjustments could be materially different from those that are reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities 
we are participating in the irs compliance assurance process program whereby we endeavor to agree with the irs on the treatment of all issues prior to filing our federal return 
a benefit of participation in this program is that post filing adjustments by the irs are less likely to occur 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
at september   net deferred tax assets were billion  which included a valuation allowance of million 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  or if there is a material change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to increase the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets which could result in an increase in our effective tax rate and an adverse impact on operating results 
we can only use net operating losses to offset taxable income of certain legal entities in certain tax jurisdictions 
at september   we had unused federal  state and foreign net operating losses of million  million and million  respectively 
based upon our assessments of projected future taxable income and losses and historical losses incurred by these entities  we expect that the future taxable income of the entities in these tax jurisdictions will not be sufficient to utilize the net operating losses we have incurred through fiscal therefore  we have provided a million valuation allowance for these net operating losses 
significant judgment is required to forecast the timing and amount of future taxable income in certain jurisdictions 
adjustments to our valuation allowance based on changes to our forecast of taxable income are reflected in the period the change is made 
we consider the operating earnings of certain non united states subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states based on estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs 
we have not recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately billion related to the united states federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on approximately billion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the united states 
should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings  we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the united states 
litigation 
we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
although there can be no assurance that unfavorable outcomes in any of these matters would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results  liquidity or financial position  we believe the claims are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the actions 
we estimate the range of liability related to pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated 
we record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable 
where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range  we record the minimum estimated liability related to the claim 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations 
for example  we recorded a million charge during fiscal in connection with a litigation settlement related to the settlement and patent license and non assert agreement with broadcom 
we are engaged in numerous other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business and  while there can be no assurance  we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results  liquidity or financial position 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
total revenues for fiscal were billion  compared to billion for fiscal revenues from two customers of our qct and qtl segments each of whom accounted for more than of our consolidated revenues for the period comprised approximately and in aggregate of total consolidated revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
revenues from sales of equipment and services for fiscal were billion  compared to billion for fiscal the increase in revenues from sales of equipment and services was primarily due to a billion increase in qct equipment and services revenues 
licensing revenues were billion in fiscal  compared to billion in fiscal the increase in licensing revenues was primarily due to a billion increase in qtl revenues 
cost of equipment and services 
cost of equipment and services revenues for fiscal was billion  compared to billion for fiscal cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and services revenues was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the decrease in margin percentage was primarily attributable to a decrease in qct gross margin percentage and the effect of million in charges from the recognition of the step up of inventories to fair value and amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisition of atheros in fiscal cost of equipment and services revenues included million in share based compensation in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and services revenues may fluctuate in future periods depending on the mix of products sold and services provided  competitive pricing  new product introduction costs and other factors 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for fiscal were billion or of revenues  compared to billion or of revenues for fiscal the dollar increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in costs related to the development of integrated circuit products  next generation technologies and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services  including lower cost devices  the integration of wireless with consumer electronics and computing  the convergence of multiband  multimode  multinetwork products and technologies  third party operating systems and services platforms 
the percentage decrease was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues relative to the increase in cost 
research and development expenses for fiscal included share based compensation of million  compared to million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were billion or of revenues  compared to billion or of revenues for fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal included a million gain on the sale of our australia spectrum license 
the remaining dollar increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in employee related expenses  a million increase in depreciation and amortization expense  primarily attributable to the acquisition of atheros  a million increase in charitable contributions  primarily resulting from the establishment of the qualcomm charitable foundation in fiscal  and a million increase in outside services 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal included share based compensation of million  compared to million in fiscal other operating expenses 
we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge related to our firethorn division due to the operating performance of a new product application falling significantly short of expectations in fiscal net investment income 
net investment income was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the net decrease was comprised as follows in millions year ended september  september  change interest and dividend income corporate and other segments qsi interest expense net realized gains on investments corporate and other segments qsi net impairment losses on investments corporate and other segments qsi losses gains on derivative instruments equity in losses of investees the increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to the bank loans related to the bwa spectrum won in the india auction in june the decrease in net impairment losses on investments is due to an overall increase in marketable securities values compared to the prior fiscal year 
income tax expense 
income tax expense was billion for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the annual effective tax rate was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  the united states government extended the federal research and development tax credit to include qualified research expenditures paid or incurred after december  and before january  we recorded a tax benefit of million related to fiscal in fiscal from the retroactive extension of this credit 
additionally  in fiscal  we recorded a tax benefit of million related to an agreement reached on a component of our fiscal through fiscal state tax returns 
the annual effective tax rate for fiscal included tax expense of approximately million that arose because certain deferred revenue was taxable in fiscal  but the resulting deferred tax asset will reverse in future years when our state tax rate will be lower as a result of california tax legislation enacted in the annual effective tax rate for fiscal of was less than the united states federal statutory rate primarily due to benefits of related to foreign earnings taxed at less than the united states federal rate and benefits of related to the research and development tax credit  partially offset by state taxes of and tax expense of related to the valuation of deferred tax assets to reflect changes in california law 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
total revenues for fiscal were billion  compared to billion for fiscal revenues from two customers of our qct and qtl segments each of whom accounted for more than of our consolidated revenues for the period comprised approximately and in aggregate of total consolidated revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
revenues from sales of equipment and services for fiscal were billion  compared to billion for fiscal the increase in revenues from sales of equipment and services was primarily due to a million increase in qct revenues 
licensing revenues were billion in fiscal  compared to billion in fiscal the increase in licensing revenues was primarily due to a million increase in qtl revenues 
cost of equipment and services 
cost of equipment and services revenues for fiscal was billion  compared to billion for fiscal cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and services revenues was for both fiscal and the margin percentage was negatively impacted by the effect of an increase in costs related to our qmt division  which was offset by an increase in qct gross margin percentage 
cost of equipment and services revenues included million in share based compensation in fiscal  compared to million for fiscal research and development expenses 
for fiscal  research and development expenses were billion or of revenues  compared to billion or of revenues for fiscal the dollar increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in costs related to the development of integrated circuit products  next generation cdma and ofdma technologies and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services 
the increase in research and development expenses was partially offset by a million decrease in costs primarily related to the development of our asset tracking products and services and brew products 
research and development expenses for fiscal included share based compensation of million  compared to million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
for fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses were billion or of revenues  compared to billion or of revenues for fiscal the dollar increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in patent related costs  a million increase in employee related expenses and a million increase in selling and marketing expenses  partially offset by a million gain on the sale of our australia spectrum license 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal included share based compensation of million  compared to million in fiscal other operating expenses 
operating expenses for fiscal included a million charge in connection with the settlement and patent license and non assert agreement with broadcom and a million fine levied by the kftc 
net investment income loss 
net investment income was million for fiscal  compared to net investment loss of million for fiscal the net increase was primarily comprised as follows in millions year ended september  september  change interest and dividend income corporate and other segments qsi interest expense net realized gains on investments corporate and other segments qsi net impairment losses on investments corporate and other segments qsi gains on derivative instruments equity in losses of investees during fiscal  we recorded lower impairment losses and higher realized gains on marketable securities  compared to fiscal depressed security values caused by a major disruption in the united states and foreign financial markets impacted our results in fiscal and continued to cause impairment losses in fiscal  but to a much lesser extent 
the increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to the bank loans related to the bwa spectrum won in the india auction in june income tax expense 
income tax expense was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the annual effective tax rate was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the annual effective tax rate for fiscal was lower than fiscal primarily as a result of the net decrease in valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset related to capital losses and an increase in tax benefits related to foreign earnings taxed at less than the united states federal rate  partially offset by a decrease in tax benefit related to tax audits settled during the year and a decrease in research and development tax credits 
the annual effective tax rate for fiscal was and only reflected the united states federal research and development credits generated through december   the date on which they expired 
the annual effective tax rate for fiscal of was less than the united states federal statutory rate primarily due to benefits of related to foreign earnings taxed at less than the united states federal rate  partially offset by state taxes of and tax expense of related to the valuation of deferred tax assets to reflect changes in california law  primarily deferred revenue that was taxable in fiscal  but for which the resulting deferred tax asset will reverse in future years when our state tax rate will be lower 
our segment results for fiscal compared to fiscal the following should be read in conjunction with the fiscal and financial results for each reporting segment 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note segment information 
qct segment

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we invest a portion of our cash in a number of diversified investment and non investment grade fixed and floating rate securities  consisting of cash equivalents  marketable debt securities and debt mutual funds 
changes in the general level of united states interest rates can affect the principal values and yields of fixed interest bearing securities 
if interest rates in the general economy were to rise rapidly in a short period of time  our fixed interest bearing securities could lose value 
when the general economy weakens significantly  the credit profile  financial strength and growth prospects of certain issuers of interest bearing securities held in our investment portfolios may deteriorate  and our interest bearing securities may lose value either temporarily or other than temporarily 
we may implement investment strategies of different types with varying duration and risk return trade offs that do not perform well 
the following table provides information about our interest bearing cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and loans payable that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows  weighted average yield at cost and contractual maturity dates 
additionally  we have assumed that the interest bearing securities are similar enough within the specified categories to aggregate the securities for presentation purposes 
principal amount by expected maturity average interest rates dollars in millions thereafter no single maturity total fixed interest bearing securities cash and cash equivalents interest rate marketable securities investment grade interest rate non investment grade interest rate floating interest bearing securities cash and cash equivalents interest rate marketable securities investment grade interest rate non investment grade interest rate loans payable floating interest rate denominated in indian rupees 
cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are recorded at fair value 
the loans payable approximate fair value 
as of september   all but one of the lenders of the loans payable had the right to demand prepayment of its portion of the loans outstanding on december   subject to sufficient prior written notice 
the date by which those lenders were required to have given notice has now passed  and those lenders can no longer demand prepayment 
one remaining lender can demand prepayment of its portion of the loans outstanding on february  million at september  if notice is given by december  we have received conditional waivers from each of the bank lenders until at least april  as a result of these items  the due date for all or a portion of the loans payable could be accelerated 
equity price risk 
we hold a diversified marketable securities portfolio that includes equity securities and equity commingled and exchange traded fund shares that are subject to equity price risk 
we have made investments in marketable equity securities of companies of varying size  style  industry and geography  and changes in investment allocations may affect the price volatility of our investments 
a decrease in the market price of our marketable equity securities and equity mutual fund and exchange traded fund shares at september  would cause a decrease in the carrying amounts of these securities of million 
at september   gross unrealized losses of our marketable equity securities and equity mutual and exchange traded fund shares were million 
although we consider these unrealized losses to be temporary  there is a risk that we may incur net other than temporary impairment charges or realized losses on the values of these securities if they do not recover in value within a reasonable period 
in connection with our stock repurchase program  we may sell put options that require us to repurchase shares of our common stock at fixed prices 
these written put options subject us to equity price risk 
at september   we had three outstanding put options  enabling holders to sell  shares of our common stock upon exercise for approximately million 
the put option liabilities  with a fair value of million at september   were included in other current liabilities 
if the fair value of our common stock at september  decreased by  the amount required to physically settle the put options would exceed the fair value of the shares by million  net of the million in premiums received 
foreign exchange risk 
we manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments  including foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial counterparties 
such derivative financial instruments are viewed as hedging or risk management tools and are not used for speculative or trading purposes 
counterparties to our derivative contracts are all major institutions 
in the event of the financial insolvency or distress of a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments  we may be unable to settle transactions if the counterparty does not provide us with sufficient collateral to secure its net settlement obligations to us  which could have a negative impact on our results 
at september   we had a net liability of million related to foreign currency option contracts that were designated as hedges of foreign currency risk on royalties earned from certain licensees on their sales of cdma based devices 
if our forecasted royalty revenues were to decline by and foreign exchange rates were to change unfavorably by in each of our hedged foreign currencies  we would incur a loss of approximately million resulting from a decrease in the fair value of the portion of our hedges that would be rendered ineffective 
at september   we had an asset of million related to a foreign currency forward contract that was designated as a net investment hedge of our investment in a wholly owned subsidiary in australia 
we are subject to market risk on such contract 
if the exchange rates relevant to that contract were to change unfavorably by  we would incur a loss of million 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  note the company and its significant accounting policies for a description of our foreign currency accounting policies 
at september   we had floating rate bank loans in the aggregate of million  which are payable in full in indian rupees in december the loans are payable in the functional currency of our consolidated subsidiaries that are party to the loans  however  we are subject to foreign currency translation risk  which may impact our liability for principal repayment and interest expense that we will record in the future 
if the foreign currency exchange rate were to change unfavorably by  we would incur additional principal of million and interest expense of million through the remainder of the contractual terms of the loans 
financial instruments held by consolidated subsidiaries that are not denominated in the functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations and may affect reported earnings 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we may hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transactions 
as a result  we could experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash flows  as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments 
while we may hedge certain transactions with non united states customers  declines in currency values in certain regions may  if not reversed  adversely affect future product sales because our products may become more expensive to purchase in the countries of the affected currencies 
our analysis methods used to assess and mitigate the risks discussed above should not be considered projections of future risks
