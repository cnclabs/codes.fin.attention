item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our selected consolidated financial data and consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and other parts of this report may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of several factors  including those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing and commercializing innovative hospital specialty products 
our current development efforts are focused on products that treat gastrointestinal infections and related diseases where current therapies have limitations  including limited efficacy  serious adverse side effects  drug to drug interactions  difficult patient compliance and bacterial resistance 
we currently have two late stage anti infective product candidates  fidaxomicin and pruvel prulifloxacin 
fidaxomicin  our lead product candidate  is a narrow spectrum antibiotic with minimal systemic absorption 
we are developing fidaxomicin as a treatment for clostridium difficile infection  or cdi  the most common nosocomial  or hospital acquired  diarrhea 
we currently hold rights to fidaxomicin in all regions of the world except for europe and certain other countries in the middle east  africa and the commonwealth of independent states  or cis 
in february  we entered into an exclusive collaboration and license agreement with astellas pharma europe ltd  or astellas  to develop and commercialize fidaxomicin in europe and certain other countries in the middle east  africa and the cis  which we refer to as the astellas territory 
in return for an exclusive license to fidaxomicin in the astellas territory  astellas paid to us an upfront cash payment of million euros  or million  and we are eligible to receive additional cash payments totaling up to million euros upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones 
furthermore  we will be entitled to receive escalating double digit royalties ranging from the high teens to low twenties on net sales of fidaxomicin in the astellas territory  if approved 
astellas will be responsible for all future costs associated with the development and commerc ialization of fidaxomicin in the astellas territory including the costs associated with the marketing authorization application  or maa  for fidaxomicin in europe 
in connection with the collaboration and license agreement  we also entered into a supply agreement with astellas pursuant to which we will be the exclusive supplier of fidaxomicin to astellas in the astellas territory and astellas is obligated to pay us an amount equal to cost plus an agreed mark up for such supply 
in july  we filed  and in august the european medicines agency  or ema  accepted for review an maa to permit marketing of fidaxomicin in europe 
in september  we began a submission to the united states food and drug administration  or fda  of a rolling new drug application  or nda  and in november we completed the submission of our nda 
in january  the fda accepted our nda filing for the treatment of cdi and for reducing the risk of recurrence when used for treatment of initial cdi 
the fda has also granted our request for six month priority review  and has assigned a prescription drug user fee act  or pdufa  goal date of may  for its review of the nda 
the fda also informed us that it plans to discuss the nda at a meeting of its anti infective drugs advisory committee currently scheduled for april  
table of contents we have completed two fidaxomicin phase trials which showed that fidaxomicin achieved the primary endpoint of clinical cure and demonstrated a significantly lower recurrence rate and significantly higher global cure rate defined as cure with no recurrence within four weeks of completing therapy compared to vancocin  the only fda approved antibiotic for the treatment of cdi 
in the two phase trials  among subjects who had experienced a prior cdi episode and recurred within three months of entering the study  treatment with fidaxomicin resulted in a reduction in repeat cdi recurrence compared to vancocin p 
the data also indicated that treatment with fidaxomicin significantly improved the recurrence rate and global cure rate in cdi patients requiring concomitant antibiotics compared to vancocin 
fidaxomicin was also well tolerated in the trials 
in february n bsp  the new england journal of medicine published results from the first phase trial 
we have also reported additional data from the second phase trial showing a clinically meaningful reduction in recurrence rates and higher global cure rates compared to vancocin in both the hyper virulent bi nap and the non bi strain type subgroups 
clinical cure rates for fidaxomicin and vancocin were similar in these two strain type subgroups 
pruvel is a prodrug in the fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics  a widely used class of broad spectrum antibiotics 
we are developing pruvel as a treatment for infectious diarrhea 
in july  we reported positive top line data from the first phase trial conducted in mexico and peru and in february  we reported positive top line data from the second phase trial conducted in india  guatemala and mexico 
the top line analysis of data from these studies showed that pruvel met the primary endpoint of tlus compared to placebo 
on november   due to a higher than expected incidence of cutaneous rash during the course of a study of the possible interaction between pruvel and antacids  we informed the fda that we were voluntarily terminating the research study 
all reported events of cutaneous rash from the drug interaction study were mild or moderate i n severity and required little or no treatment and all resolved completely 
we are currently conducting an investigation into the cause of the rash prior to initiating any new study with pruvel 
rashes are a known and infrequent side effect of fluoroquinolone antibiotics  such as pruvel  and rashes occurred at or below the rate generally expected for other fluoroquinolones in both of our previous pruvel phase clinical trials 
pending the results of our investigation  we are not currently able to estimate when we will initiate any new study or the extent of the delay in our planned submission of an nda for pruvel 
we currently hold rights to commercialize pruvel in the united states  and it is sold by other parties in japan  italy and certain other european countries 
we are developing additional product candidates using our proprietary technology  including our opops 
opops is a computer aided technology that allows the development of potential drug candidates through carbohydrate mediated medicinal chemistry and enables the rapid synthesis of a wide variety of proprietary molecules 
it includes glycooptimization  which enables the modification of a carbohydrate group on an existing drug to improve its properties  and de novo glycosylation  which introduces new carbohydrate groups on existing drugs to create new patentable compounds with improvement of pharmacokinetics 
we previously acquired exclusive rights to opt  a combination of a novel carbohydrate based cancer immunotherapy together with an adjuvant  which we licensed from memorial sloan kettering cancer center  or mskcc 
in october  we assigned to obi certain of our patent rights and know how related to opt and also assigned to obi our rights and obligations under a related license agreement with mskcc 
in april  obi filed an investigational new drug application  or ind  in taiwan for opt  and in january  obi initiated a phase clinical trial for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer which it intends to conduct in taiwan  south korea  hong kong and singapore 
other potential indications for opt are being evaluated 
we have the right to receive up to million from obi in future milestone payments related to th e development of opt as well as royalties on net sales of this product candidate 
in february  pursuant to an amendment to an october financing agreement  obi sold newly issued shares of its common stock for gross proceeds of approximately million new taiwan dollars approximately million based on then current exchange rates 
we purchased million new taiwan dollars approximately million based on then current exchange rates of the shares issued in the financing  such that we currently maintain a equity interest in obi 
we were incorporated in november since inception  we have focused on developing our product candidates  including fidaxomicin and pruvel 
we have never been profitable and have incurred significant net losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
these losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with research and development activities  including the costs of clinical trial activities associated with our current lead product candidates  license fees and general and administrative expenses 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the next several years as we pursue the regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates  as well as acquire or in license additional products or product candidates  technologies or businesses that are complementary to our own 

table of contents financial operations overview collaboration and grant revenues we have not generated any revenues from sales of commercial products 
since inception  we have generated revenues primarily as a result of various collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and grants from government agencies 
we may also periodically recognize as revenues non refundable payments for achieving certain milestones during the term of our collaboration agreements 
research and development expense research and development expense consists of expenses incurred in connection with identifying and developing our drug candidates and developing and advancing our drug discovery technology 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related employee benefits  costs associated with clinical trials managed by our cros and costs associated with non clinical research activities and regulatory approvals 
our most significant costs are for clinical trials  including payments to vendors such as cros  investigators  manufacturers of clinical supplies and related consultants 
our historical research and development expenses have resulted predominantly from our clinical trials of fidaxomicin and pruvel  the development of our carbohydrate technology platforms  including opops  in licensing fees and general research activities 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as they are incurred because the underlying technology associated with these expenditures relates to our research and development efforts and has no alternative future uses 
from inception through december   we incurred total research and development expenses of approximately million 
we use our internal research and development resources across several projects  and much of this use is not allocable to a specific project 
accordingly  we do not account for all of our internal research and development costs on a project basis 
in addition to our internal resources  we use external service providers and vendors to conduct our clinical trials  to manufacture our product candidates to be used in clinical trials and to provide various other research and development related products and services 
these external costs are allocable to specific projects 
we incurred million  million and million of research and development expenses directly related to the development of fidaxomicin for the years ended december  and  and cumulatively through december   respectively 
we incurred million  million  and million of research and development expenses directly related to the development of pruvel for the years ended december  and  and cumulatively through december   respectively 
all other research and development expenses were for other clinical programs 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation  including stock based compensation  and other expenses related to an allocated portion of facility cost  legal fees and other professional services expenses  our corporate administrative employees and insurance costs 
we anticipate that we will maintain our existing level of general and administrative expenditures 
however  we will make determinations as to the necessary levels of general and administrative expenditures on an on going basis in response to our research and development activities and regulatory obligations 
interest income expense and other  net interest income expense and other  net consists of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and other than temporary declines in the market value of available for sale securities and cash and non cash interest charges related to bridge financings 
net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards as of december  we had federal  state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
if not utilized  the net operating loss carryforwards will begin expiring in for federal purposes and for state purposes 
the foreign losses originate from our subsidiary in taiwan 
the losses from our subsidiary in taiwan expire ten years after origination 
as of december   we had both federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal tax credits will begin expiring in unless previously utilized and the state tax credits carryforward indefinitely 
as of december   we had a state manufacturer s investment tax credit carryforward of approxima tely  which will begin to expire in  unless previously utilized 
under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  substantial changes in our ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income 
any such annual limitation may significantly reduce the utilization of the net operating losses and tax credits before they expire 
as of december   we have completed a section analysis regarding the limitation of the net operating losses and credit carryovers and determined that the entire amount of us federal and state net operating losses and credit carryovers are available for utilization  subject to the annual limitation 
any carryforwards that will expire prior to utilization as a result of future limitation will be removed from deferred tax assets with a corresponding reduction of the valuation allowance 
due to the existence of the valuation allowance  future changes in the unrecognized tax benefits will not impact the effective tax rate 

table of contents as of december   we have completed a section analysis regarding the limitation of the net operating losses and credit carryovers and had determined that the maximum amount of us federal and state nol and credit carryovers are available for utilization  subject to the annual limitation 
based on the analysis  the related deferred tax assets were reinstated in and the corresponding valuation allowance was increased 
any carryforwards that will expire prior to utilization as a result of future limitations will be removed from deferred tax assets with a corresponding reduction of the valuation allowance 
due to the existence of the valuation allowance  future changes in the unrecognized tax benefits will not impact the effective tax rate 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our license and collaboration agreements contain multiple elements  including non refundable upfront fees  payments for reimbursement of third party research costs  payments for ongoing research  payments associated with achieving specific development milestones and royalties based on specified percentages of net product sales  if any 
we consider a variety of factors in determining the appropriate method of revenue recognition under these arrangements  such as whether the elements are separable  whether there are determinable fair values and whether there is a unique earnings process associated with each element of a contract 
cash received in advance of services being performed is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue as services are performed over the applicable term of the agreement 
when a payment is specifically tied to a separate earnings process  revenues are recognized when the specific performance obligation associated with the payment is completed 
performance obligations typically consist of significant and substantive milestones 
revenues from milestone payments may be considered separable from funding for research services because of the uncertainty surrounding the achievement of milestones for products in early stages of development 
accordingly  these milestone payments are allowed to be recognized as revenue if and when the performance milestone is achieved if they represent a substantive earnings process 
in connection with certain research collaboration agreements  revenues are recognized from non refundable upfront fees  which we do not believe are specifically tied to a separate earnings process  ratably over the term of the agreement or the period over which we have significant involvement or perform services 
research fees are recognized as revenue as the related research activities are performed 
with respect to revenues derived from reimbursement of direct out of pocket expenses for research costs associated with grants  in transactions where we act as a principal with discretion to choose suppliers  bear credit risk and perform part of the services required in the transaction  we record revenue for the gross amount of the reimbursement 
the costs associated with these reimbursements are reflected as a component of research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
none of the payments that we have received from collaborators to date  whether recognized as revenue or deferred  are refundable even if the related program is not successful 
research and development research and development costs are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of costs associated with clinical trials  compensation  including stock based compensation  and other expenses related to research and development  including personnel costs  facilities costs and depreciation 

table of contents when nonrefundable payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are made  we defer and capitalize these types of payments 
the capitalized amounts are expensed when the related goods are delivered or the services are performed 
accrued expenses a substantial portion of our on going research and development activities are performed under agreements we enter into with external service providers  including cros  who conduct many of our research and development activities 
we accrue the costs incurred under these contracts based on factors such as estimates of work performed  milestones achieved  patient enrollment and costs historically incurred for similar contracts 
as actual costs become known  we adjust our accruals 
to date  our accruals have been within management s estimates  and no material adjustments to research and development expenses have been recognized 
subsequent changes in estimates may result in a material change in our accruals  which could also materially affect our results of operations 
stock based compensation authoritative guidance requires that share based payment transactions with employees be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value and recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period 
we used the modified prospective method and accordingly we did not restate the results of operations for the prior periods 
compensation expense of million  million and million was recognized in the years ended december   and  respectively 
stock based compensation expense is estimated as of the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which generally represents the vesting period 
we estimate the fair value of our stock options using the black scholes option pricing model and the fair value of our stock awards based on the quoted market price of our common stock 
estimating the fair value for stock options requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected term  expected dividends and risk free interest rates 
due to limited historical date  the expected volatility rate incorporates the historical volatility of comparable companies whose share prices are publicly available 
the average expected term is calculated using the simplified method for estimating the expected term 
expected dividends are estimated based on our dividend history as well as our current projections 
optimer s risk free interest rate for periods approximating the expected terms of the options is based on the us treasury zero coupon bonds with maturities similar to the periods approximating the expected terms of the options while obi s the risk free interest rate is based on central bank of china 
these assumptions are updated on an annual basis or sooner if there is a significant change in circumstances that could affect these assumptions 
equity instruments issued to non employees are recorded at their fair value and are periodically revalued as the equity instruments vest and are recognized as expense over the related service period 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and collaboration and grant revenues

net interest income and other for the year ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates on cash  cash equivalents and investments 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity since inception  our operations have been financed primarily through the sale of equity securities 
through march   we received gross proceeds of approximately million from the sale of shares of our preferred and common stock as follows in may  we sold a total of million shares of series a preferred stock for proceeds of million  from march to december  we sold a total of million shares of series b preferred stock for proceeds of million  in april  we sold a total of million shares of series c preferred stock for proceeds of million  from april to november  we sold a total of million shares of series d preferred stock for proceeds of million  in february  we sold a total of million shares of our common stock in connection with our initial public offering for proceeds of million  in october  we sold a total of million shares of our common stock in connection with a private placement offering for proceeds of million  in july  we sold a total of million shares of our common stock in a registered direct offering for proceeds of million  in march  we sold a total of million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of our common stock in a registered direct offering for proceeds of million  in march  we sold a total of million shares of our common stock in a public offering for proceeds of million  
table of contents in february  we sold a total of million shares of our common stock in a public offering for proceeds of million 
in addition  in march  pursuant to our collaboration and license agreement with astellas  we received million euros  or million  as an upfront payment from astellas 
until required for operations  we invest a substantial portion of our available funds in money market funds  united states government instruments and other readily marketable debt instruments  all of which are investment grade quality 
we have established guidelines relating to diversification and maturities of our investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity 
cash flows as of december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled approximately million as compared to million as of december   an increase of approximately million 
the increase in our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments was primarily due to the net million raised in a follow on offering of our common stock in march  offset by the use of cash for our operating expenses 
of the million  million was held by obi as of december  we cannot be certain if  when or to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization of our product candidates 
we expect our development expenses to be substantial and to increase over the next few years as we advance the development of our product candidates and prepare for regulatory submissions and commercialization 
in february  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with astellas pursuant to which we granted to astellas an exclusive  royalty bearing license under certain of our know how and intellectual property to develop and commercialize fidaxomicin in the astellas territory 
under the terms of the license agreement with astellas  astellas paid to us an upfront fee equal to million euros  or approximately million  and we are eligible to receive additional cash payments totaling up to million euros upon the achievement by astellas of specified regulatory and commercial milestones 
in addition  we will be entitled to receive escalating double digit royalties ranging from the high teens to low twenties on net sales of fidaxomicin products in the astellas territory  which royalties are subject to reduction in certain  limited circumstances 
such royalti es will be payable by astellas on a product by product and country by country basis until a generic product accounts for a specified market share of the applicable fidaxomicin product in the applicable country 
in february  we regained worldwide rights to fidaxomicin from par under a prospective buy back agreement 
we paid par a one time million milestone payment in june for our successful completion of the second pivotal phase trial for fidaxomicin 
we are obligated to pay par a royalty on net sales by us or our affiliates of fidaxomicin in north america and israel  and a royalty on net sales by us or our affiliates of fidaxomicin in the rest of the world 
in addition  we are required to pay par a royalty on net revenues we receive from licensees of our right to market fidaxomicin in the rest of the world 
we are obligated to pay each of these royalties  if any  on a country by country basis for seven years commencing on the applicable commercial launch in each such country 
in may  we entered into a long term supply agreement with biocon for the commercial manufacture of fidaxomicin s active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api 
pursuant to the agreement  biocon agreed to manufacture and supply to us  up to certain limits  fidaxomicin api and  subject to certain conditions  we agreed to purchase from biocon at least a portion of our requirements for fidaxomicin api in the united states and canada 
we previously paid to biocon million for certain equipment purchases and manufacturing scale up activities  and we may be entitled to recover up to million of this amount under the supply agreement in the form of discounted prices for fidaxomicin api 
we may be obligated to make additional payments to biocon if we fail to meet minimum purchase requirements after biocon has dedicated certain manufacturing capacity to the production of fid axomicin api and if biocon is unable to manufacture alternative products with the dedicated capacity 
in june  we entered into a license agreement with nippon shinyaku pursuant to which we acquired the non exclusive right to import and purchase pruvel  and the exclusive right with the right to sublicense  within the united states  to develop  make  use  offer to sell  sell and license products suitable for consumption by humans containing pruvel 
under the terms of the agreement  we will be required to pay nippon shinyaku a milestone payment in the amount of million upon the filing  if any  of a nda for pruvel in the united states 

table of contents in october  our compensation committee adopted a severance benefit plan covering certain eligible employees of the company  including executive officers 
in may  the severance benefit plan was amended and restated 
pursuant to the plan  upon an involuntary termination other than for cause  an eligible employee may be entitled to receive specified severance benefits 
the benefits may include cash severance payments and acceleration of stock award vesting 
the level of benefits provided under the plan depends upon an eligible employee s position and years of service  and whether the termination is related to a change in control 
in october  we entered into certain transactions with our subsidiary  obi  pursuant to which we assigned certain intellectual property rights and license agreements to obi related to our opt product candidate 
in connection with these transactions  we entered into a financing agreement with obi and a group of new investors 
under the terms of the financing agreement  if obi achieves certain development milestones with respect to opt  we and the group of new investors may be required to purchase approximately an additional million and million  respectively  of new obi common shares 
in february  pursuant to an amendment to an october financing agreement  obi sold newly issued shares of its common stock for gross proceeds of approximately million new taiwan dollars approximately million based on then current exchange rates 
we purchased million new taiwan dollars approximately million based on then current exchange rates of the shares issued in the financing  such that we currently maintain a equity interest in obi 
in july  we received a  milestone payment from cempra under the terms of a licensing agreement between the companies 
the milestone payment was made as a result of cempra s continuing development of a next generation macrolide cem for the treatment of respiratory infections 
cempra licensed cem from optimer and has successfully completed a phase study 
funding requirements our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous factors including  but not limited to  the following the costs of preparing and pursuing applications for regulatory approvals and the timing of such approvals  the costs of establishing sales or distribution capabilities and the timing of such efforts  our decision to conduct future clinical trials  including the timing and progress of such clinical trials  our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations  including licensing and other arrangements  the costs involved in prosecuting  enforcing or defending patent claims or other intellectual property rights  the success of the commercialization of our products  and the extent to which we in license  acquire or invest in other indications  products  technologies and businesses 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next months 
until we can generate significant cash from our operations  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources that were primarily generated from the proceeds of offerings of our equity securities and collaborations and government grants 
in addition  we may finance future cash needs through the sale of additional equity securities  strategic collaboration agreements and debt financing 
however  we may not be successful in completing future equity financings  in entering into additional collaboration agreements  in receiving milestone or royalty payments under new or existing collaboration agreements  in obtaining new government grants or in obtaining debt financing 
in addition  we cannot be sure that our existing cash and investment resources will be adequate  that financing will be available when needed or that  if available  financing will be obtaine d on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
the credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the government take over  bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions 
these events have generally made equity and debt financing more difficult to obtain  and may negatively impact our ability to complete financing transactions 
having insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs  relinquish some or even all of our rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or renegotiate less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose 
failure to obtain adequate financing also may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if we raise funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders would likely result 
if we raise funds by incurring addi tional debt financing  the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table describes our long term contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years after years in thousands operating lease obligations our facilities currently consist of laboratory and office space in two facilities in san diego  california 
our operating leases for these facilities expire on november with one of our leases subject to a one five year renewal option and the other lease subject to a two year renewal option 
the contractual obligations table does not include a a potential future milestone payment in the amount of million to nippon shinyaku due upon filing our first nda in the united states for pruvel  b potential future milestone payments to cempra in the amount of million due upon the regulatory approval of each of the first two products we develop under our licensing agreement with cempra in any country which is a member of the association of southeast asian nations  or asean  c potential future milestone payments of up to million to tsri due upon achievement of certain clinical milestones  the filing of ndas or their foreign equivalents and government marketing and distribution approval  or d the payments for newly signed lease agreement for office space in new jersey in february we may also be required to pay royalties on any net sale s of pruvel  fidaxomicin and other licensed product candidates 
the milestone and royalty payments under our license agreements are not included in the table above because we cannot  at this time  determine when or if the related milestones will be achieved or the events triggering the commencement of payment obligations will occur 
recently issued accounting pronouncements fasb issued the following accounting amendments in april  the fasb issued amendments related to the revenue recognition method for milestone payments in research and development agreements 
under these amendments  entities can make an accounting policy election to recognize a payment that is contingent upon the achievement of a substantive milestone in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
the amendments are effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after june   which for us means such amendments will take effect beginning with the fiscal year starting on january  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  cash flow or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued authoritative guidance for arrangements with multiple deliveries 
the guidance will allow companies to allocate consideration from contractual arrangements in multiple deliverables arrangements in a manner that better reflects the economics of the transaction 
the new guidance requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures and is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption of the auidance is permitted 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the guidance on the company s future financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash equivalents and marketable securities risk our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  consisted primarily of money market funds and united states government instruments and other readily marketable debt instruments 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
a hypothetical ten percent change in interest rates during the year ended december  would have resulted in approximately a  change in net loss 
accordingly  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates applicable to our securities portfolio 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  consisted primarily of money market funds and united states government instruments and other readily marketable debt instruments 
a hypothetical ten percent change in interest rates during the year ended december  would have resulted in approximately a  change in net loss 

table of contents fair value measurements all of our investment securities are available for sale securities and are reported on the consolidated balance sheet at market value except for one auction rate preferred securities or arps with a par value of approximately million 
as a result of the negative conditions in the global credit markets  our arps is currently not liquid 
in the event we need to access the funds that are in an illiquid state  we will not be able to do so without a loss of principal  until the securities are redeemed by the issuer or they mature 
foreign currency risk we have operated primarily in the united states of america and most transactions during the year ended december   have been made in us dollars 
accordingly  we have not had any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
we do not have any foreign currency hedging instruments in place 
certain transactions related to our company and our subsidiary  obi  are denominated primarily in taiwan dollars 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets where optimer conducts business  including the impact of the existing crisis in the global financial markets in such countries and the impact on both the us dollar and the taiwan dollars 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
we do not engage in exchange rate hedging or hold or issue foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes 
currently  we do not expect the impact of fluctuations in the relative fair value of other currencies to be material
