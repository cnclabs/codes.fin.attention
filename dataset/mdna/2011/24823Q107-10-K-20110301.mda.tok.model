our product portfolio includes active cellular immunotherapy and small molecule product candidates to treat a wide range of cancers 
on april   the us food and drug administration fda licensed provenge sipuleucel t  our first in class autologous cellular immunotherapy for the treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic  metastatic  castrate resistant hormone refractory prostate cancer 
commercial sale of provenge began in may in january  we announced plans to seek marketing authorization for the sale of provenge in europe 
prostate cancer is the most common non skin cancer among men in the united states  with over one million men currently diagnosed with the disease  and the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men in the united states 
we own worldwide rights for provenge 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was billion  of which million relates to the value of the warrant liability described below 
we have incurred net losses as a result of research and development expenses  clinical trial expenses  contract manufacturing and facility expenses  costs associated with the commercial launch of provenge and general and administrative expenses in support of our operations and research efforts 
we anticipate that near term we will continue to fund our ongoing research  development and general operations from available cash  including proceeds from our january convertible notes offering  and revenue generated from commercial sales of provenge 
our available cash will allow us to continue to expand our operations including our manufacturing capabilities  continue our clinical trials  apply for regulatory approvals and build commercial infrastructure outside the us and invest in research and product development 
the majority of our resources continue to be used in support of the commercialization of provenge 
even if we are able to successfully realize our commercialization goals for provenge  because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with commercialization of a biologic  we are unable to predict when we will become profitable  if at all 
even if we do produce revenues and achieve profitability  we may not be able to maintain or increase profitability 
in  we achieved revenue from provenge of million 
during  we supported commercial sale of provenge from the available capacity at our manufacturing facility in morris plains  new jersey new jersey facility 
we anticipate our manufacturing capabilities will significantly increase during with the licensure by the fda of additional capacity at our new jersey facility in the first quarter of  and licensure of our new facilities in orange county  california orange county facility and atlanta  georgia atlanta facility  which we anticipate to occur mid year on february   we submitted our request to the fda for licensure of the orange county facility to manufacture provenge 
we expect to establish relationships with and support approximately infusion sites by the end of soon after provenge was approved by the fda  the national comprehensive cancer network nccn listed provenge in the nccn clinical practice guidelines in oncology for prostate cancer and nccn drugs biologics compendium as a category treatment recommendation for patients with castrate resistant prostate cancer 
a category recommendation means that the recommendation is based on high level evidence eg  randomized controlled trials and there is uniform nccn consensus 
with respect to reimbursement  all of the regional medicare administrative contractors macs have established coverage guidelines for on label use of provenge or have stated that they will process provenge claims 
in addition  a significant number of private payers including aetna  emblem health  humana  kaiser  cigna  healthnet  regence of washington  united healthcare and wellpoint established local or national coverage 
on june   the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms opened a national coverage analysis for provenge 
the agency is expected to issue a proposed decision memorandum by march  with an analysis completion date of june  in the event cms were to impose restrictions or additional requirements on coverage of provenge by medicare contractors it could have a significant adverse impact on provenge sales 
cms met in november to consider and review commentary on the currently available evidence regarding the impact of labeled and unlabeled use of autologous cellular immunotherapy treatment on health outcomes of patients with metastatic prostate cancer 
data from the pivotal phase impact study for provenge was published in the july  issue of the new england journal of medicine  showing that provenge demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival compared to control in men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer 
following a number of pre submission meetings with european union eu national agencies  we expect that data from our phase db impact immunotherapy for prostate adenocarcinoma treatment study  supported by data from our d and da studies  will be sufficient to seek regulatory approval for provenge in the eu we plan to use the clinical data described in our us biologics license application to file our marketing authorization application maa to the european medicines agency ema in late or early to accelerate the regulatory timeline  initially provenge will be manufactured through a contract manufacturing organization while we concurrently build an immunotherapy manufacturing facility in europe 
we anticipate a regulatory decision from the eu in the first half of as of december   our manufacturing operations employed approximately individuals and our commercial team included approximately individuals employed in sales  marketing  and government affairs 
during the second half of  our field based teams were primarily focused on training infusion sites and customer education in addition to sales activity for provenge 
other potential product candidates we have under development include our investigational active cellular immunotherapy  dn  directed against her neu for the treatment of patients with bladder  breast  ovarian and other solid tumors expressing her neu 
in december we filed an investigational new drug application with the fda for dn for the treatment of invasive bladder cancer 
active cellular immunotherapies directed at carbonic anhydrase ca  an antigen highly expressed in renal cell carcinoma  and carcinoembryonic antigen cea  an antigen expressed in colorectal cancer  are in preclinical development 
we are also developing an orally available small molecule targeting trpm that could be applicable to multiple types of cancer in advanced cancer patients 
we commenced our phase clinical trial to evaluate trpm in and the trial is ongoing 
critical accounting policies and estimates we make judgmental decisions and estimates with underlying assumptions when applying accounting principles to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
certain critical accounting policies requiring significant judgments  estimates  and assumptions are detailed below 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and changes to the estimate or different estimates that could have reasonably been used would have materially changed our consolidated financial statements 
the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  should our actual experience differ from these assumptions and other considerations used in estimating these amounts  the impact of these differences could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue primarily from the sale of provenge and collaborative research agreements 
revenue from the sale of provenge is recorded net of product returns and estimated healthcare provider contractual chargebacks 
revenues from sales of provenge are recognized upon our confirmed product delivery to and issuance of the product release form to the physician site 
as we executed a drop shipment agreement with a credit worthy third party wholesaler wholesaler to sell provenge  the wholesaler assumes all bad debt risk from the physician  and no allowance for bad debt is recorded 
due to the limited usable life of our product  actual returns are credited against sales in the month they are incurred 
healthcare provider contractual chargebacks are the result of contractual commitments by us to provide products to healthcare providers at specified prices or discounts such as pursuant to mandatory federal programs 
chargebacks occur when a contracted healthcare provider purchases our products through the wholesaler at fixed contract prices that are lower than the price we charge the wholesaler 
the wholesaler  in turn  charges us back for the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesaler and the contract price paid to the wholesaler by the healthcare providers 
these chargebacks will be recognized in the same period that the related revenue is recognized  resulting in a reduction in product sales revenue and are recorded as other accrued liabilities 
for the year ended december  we did not have any chargebacks 
we recognize collaborative research revenue from up front payments  milestone payments  and personnel supported research funding 
the payments received under these research collaboration agreements are generally contractually not refundable even if the research effort is not successful 
performance under our collaborative agreements is measured by scientific progress  as mutually agreed upon by us and our collaborators 
such revenue was insignificant for the years ended december   and inventory inventories are determined at the lower of cost or market value with cost determined under the specific identification method 
inventories consist of raw materials  work in process and finished goods 
we began capitalizing raw material inventory in mid april in preparation for our provenge product launch when the product was considered to have a high probability of regulatory approval and the related costs were expected to be recoverable through the commercialization of the product 
costs incurred prior to mid april have been recorded as research and development expense in our statement of operations 
as a result  inventory balances and cost of revenue for the next few quarters will reflect a lower average per unit cost of materials 
cash  cash equivalents  and investments we consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity at purchase of days or less to be cash equivalents 
the amounts are recorded at cost  which approximates fair value 
our cash equivalents and short term and long term investments consist principally of commercial paper  money market securities  treasury notes  agency bonds  corporate bonds notes and certificates of deposit 
we have classified our entire investment portfolio as available for sale 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity and included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the amortized cost of investments is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
such amortization and accretion are included in interest income 
interest earned on securities is included in interest income 
gains are recognized when realized in our consolidated statements of operations 
losses are recognized when realized and when we have determined that an other than temporary decline in fair value has occurred 
we periodically evaluate whether declines in fair values of our investments below their cost are other than temporary 
this evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs 
additionally  we assess whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell any investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
we consider an investment with a maturity greater than twelve months from the balance sheet date as long term and a maturity less than twelve months as short term at the balance sheet date 
the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
fair value we currently measure and report at fair value our cash equivalents and investment securities 
we also measured and reported at fair value our warrant liability  prior to exercise of the warrants in the second quarter of fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability  an exit price  in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
assets and liabilities typically recorded at fair value on a non recurring basis include long lived assets measured at fair value due to an impairment assessment under asc  property  plant and equipment  and asset retirement obligations initially measured under asc  asset retirement and environmental obligations 
accounting for stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value and is recognized on the accelerated method as expense over the requisite service period 
compensation cost for all stock based awards is measured at fair value as of the grant date 
the fair value of our stock options is calculated using the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model 
the bsm model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the bsm model change significantly  stock based compensation expense for new awards may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
we also grant restricted stock awards that generally vest over a four year period and restricted stock awards with performance conditions 
in december we granted restricted stock awards with certain performance conditions to certain executive officers 
at each reporting date  we are required to evaluate whether achievement of the performance condition is probable 
compensation expense is recorded based upon our assessment of accomplishing each performance provision  over the appropriate service period 
for the year ended december   no expense was recognized related to these awards 
we determine the fair value of awards under our employee stock purchase plan using the bsm model 
for additional information about stock based compensation  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements effective during the quarter ended march   the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  subsequent events asu  amending asc  subsequent events  to state that an entity that is a sec filer is required to evaluate subsequent events through the date that the financial statements are issued  but is not required to disclose the date 
the amendment was effective commencing with the quarter ended march  the adoption of asu did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
during the quarter ended march   we adopted asu  fair value measurements and disclosures asu  which updated asc  fair value measurements and disclosures 
asu requires disclosure as to the amounts and purpose of significant asset transfers between level and fair value measurements 
asu also requires separate disclosure of level fair value measurement activity as it relates to purchases  sales  issuances and settlements 
the disclosure requirements related to level and level fair value measurements were effective commencing with the quarter ended march  the disclosure requirements related to the level fair value measurements are effective commencing with the quarter ending march  the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
results of operations for the years ended december   and revenue year ended december  in thousands product revenue collaborative revenue total revenue product revenue of million in resulted from commercial sale of provenge following fda approval on april  product revenue for reflects approximately eight months of product sales activity 
we recognize product revenues from the sale of provenge upon our confirmed product delivery to the prescribing site and issuance of the product release form to the physician site 
we expect product revenue to increase in as additional manufacturing capacity becomes available and we increase our commercialization efforts 
collaborative revenue includes the recognition of deferred revenue related to a license agreement and royalty revenue 
cost of revenue cost of revenue was million for the year ended december  the cost of revenue includes the costs of manufacturing and distributing provenge  including overhead and excess manufacturing costs due to under utilization of our new jersey facility plant capacity during although commercial manufacture of provenge began in may after fda approval  substantial production of provenge for commercial sale did not commence until the third quarter of during april and may  the new jersey facility primarily manufactured provenge for clinical patients who were enrolled in existing clinical trials prior to fda approval 
the costs related to clinical manufacture are classified as research and development expense 
gross margins on new product introductions generally increase over the life of the product as utilization of capacity increases and manufacturing efforts on product cost reduction are successful 
as we expand our product distribution  we anticipate cost of revenue as a percentage of product revenue will decline in future years 
we incurred substantial costs associated with the portion of the new jersey facility that was not operational during the year 
these costs were classified as selling  general and administrative expense 
we expect that these expenses will continue to increase as we add additional headcount in anticipation of being licensed by the fda during the first quarter of to produce provenge for commercial sale in the expanded capacity of our new jersey facility  as well as hiring for our orange county facility and atlanta facility 
we began capitalizing raw material inventory in mid april  in preparation for our provenge product launch  when the product was considered to have a high probability of regulatory approval and the related costs were expected to be recoverable through the commercialization of the product 
such costs incurred prior to mid april were recorded as research and development expense in our statement of operations 
as a result  cost of revenues will reflect a lower average per unit cost of materials offset by higher per unit manufacturing overhead due to under utilization of plant capacity for the next few quarters 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in the increase in research and development expense for the year ended is the result of increased employee related expenses  including stock based compensation expense  clinical trial costs in connection with sipuleucel t trials  as well as expenses incurred in securing second source suppliers and expanding product pipeline development 
we also manufactured provenge for clinical patients who were enrolled in existing clinical trials prior to the approval date 
the increase in research and development expense for the year ended as compared to is the result of increased wages  payroll taxes and other employee related expenses  including stock based compensation expense  as well as product development costs in connection with provenge 
financial data related to our research and development activities is categorized as either costs associated with clinical programs  discovery research or developing second source suppliers 
our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and were as follows year ended december  in millions clinical programs direct costs indirect costs total clinical programs second source contract manufacturing expenses discovery research total research and development expense direct research and development costs associated with our clinical programs include clinical trial site costs  clinical manufacturing costs  costs incurred for consultants and other outside services  such as data management and statistical analysis support  and materials and supplies used in support of the clinical programs 
indirect costs of our clinical programs include wages  payroll taxes and other employee related expenses  including stock based compensation  rent  utilities and other facilities related maintenance costs 
costs attributable to second source contract manufacturing expenses include technology transfer and process development costs related to developing second source suppliers 
costs attributable to our discovery research programs represent our efforts to develop and expand our product pipeline 
the costs in each category may change in the future and new categories may be added 
while we believe our clinical programs are promising  we do not know whether any commercially viable products in addition to provenge will result from our research and development efforts 
due to the unpredictable nature of scientific research and product development  we cannot reasonably estimate the timeframe over which our product development programs are likely to be completed  whether they will be completed  if they are completed  whether they will provide therapeutic benefit or be approved for commercialization by the necessary regulatory agencies  or whether  if approved  they will be scalable to meet commercial demand 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consisted of salaries and wages  stock based compensation  consulting fees  sales and marketing fees and administrative costs to support our operations 
in addition  as mentioned above  selling  general and administrative expenses include the expenses associated with the portion of our new jersey facility which was not commercially operational during and related costs of personnel in training 
the significant increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared to was primarily attributable to higher payroll costs from increased headcount and commercial product launch preparation activities  including non operational manufacturing capacity 
we incurred substantial costs associated with the portion of the new jersey facility which was not operational during we have also begun incurring pre operational costs at the atlanta facility and orange county facility  both of which have been substantially completed and are undergoing validation activities 
these costs include facility related expenditures  additional headcount to support the build out as well as to prepare for commercial production of provenge in anticipation of licensure of the facilities mid year by the fda 
the cost related to these activities in was approximately million  and represents ongoing expenses at all three of the manufacturing facilities that will be classified as cost of revenue when the related commercial operations commence  as well as one time start up costs required to support the manufacturing launch of provenge 
we expect that these types of expenditures will continue to increase until the facilities become fully operational 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared with was primarily attributable to increased payroll and outside costs related to pre commercialization efforts for provenge 
interest income interest income was million in   in and million in the slight increase in interest income in was primarily due to higher average investment balances during  as compared to the decrease in compared to was due to lower average interest rates 
interest expense interest expense was million in  million in and million in the decrease in interest expense in compared to was primarily due to increased capitalized interest expense in related to the construction of our manufacturing facilities 
the decrease in interest expense in compared to was the result of lower average debt balances and an increase in capitalized interest related to the construction of our manufacturing facilities and our product tracking and scheduling system 
warrant liability in april  we issued million shares of our common stock  and warrants to purchase up to million shares of common stock to an institutional investor  as further discussed in the liquidity and capital resources financings from the sale of securities and issuance of convertible notes section 
the warrants contained a fundamental change provision  as defined in the warrants  which may in certain circumstances allow the warrants to be redeemed for cash in an amount equal to the black scholes value 
the warrants were recorded at fair value at issuance and were adjusted to fair value at each reporting period until exercised in the second quarter of any change in fair value between reporting periods was recorded as other income expense 
the warrants continued to be reported as a liability until they were exercised  at which time the warrants were adjusted to fair value and reclassified from liabilities to stockholders equity 
the fair value of the warrants was estimated using the bsm model 
the fair value of the warrants on the exercise date was million  compared with million at december  non operating loss associated with the increase in warrant liability for the year ended december  was million  as compared to a non operating loss of million for the year ended december  and a non operating gain of  for the year ended december  the warrant agreement was amended and immediately exercised in may and therefore the fair value of the warrants will have no further impact on our results of operations in the future 
income taxes we recognized million in income tax benefit in relating to refundable credits  compared with no income tax expense or benefit in or as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards nols of approximately million and million  respectively 
we also had federal and state research and development credit carryforwards r d credits of approximately million and million  respectively 
the nols and r d credits expire at various dates  beginning in through  if not utilized 
utilization of the nols and r d credits may be subject to annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of the annual limitations may result in the expiration of nols and r d credits before utilization 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
significant components of our deferred tax assets include net operating loss carryforwards  research credits and stock based compensation 
our net deferred tax asset of million and million at december  and  respectively  has been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the deferred tax assets have been offset by a valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance relates primarily to net deferred tax assets from operating losses 
excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises are recorded directly to stockholders equity only when realized 
as a result  the excess tax benefits included in net operating loss carryforwards  but not reflected in deferred tax assets  for fiscal year and are million and million  respectively 
stock based compensation expense we recorded stock based compensation expense in the consolidated statements of operations for  and as follows year ended december  in millions cost of revenue research and development selling  general and administrative total stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for  and increased our net loss per share by  and  respectively 
the increase in stock based compensation expense in was primarily related to increased headcount and the increased valuation of stock options and restricted stock awards as a result of our increased stock price 
liquidity and capital resources cash uses and proceeds as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments 
to date  we have financed our operations primarily through proceeds from the sale of equity  debt and convertible securities  cash receipts from collaborative agreements  interest income  and most recently sales of provenge 
net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
expenditures related to operating activities in these periods were a result of costs associated with the commercial launch of provenge in  and research and development expenses  clinical trial costs  contract manufacturing costs and selling  general and administrative expenses in support of our operations in each of these years 
the increase in net cash used in operating activities in resulted from expenses associated with the commercial launch of provenge in  including working capital needs to support increased inventory  increased selling  general and administrative expense  primarily as a result of an increase in personnel from as of december  to  as of december   and pre launch expenditures 
the increase in net cash used in operating activities in  as compared to  was due to expenses incurred related to the prospective commercial launch of provenge in since our inception  investing activities  other than purchases and maturities of short term and long term investments  consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment 
purchases of property and equipment increased to million in compared to million in and million in  primarily related to facilities expenditures for the three manufacturing facility build outs 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared with million in and million in the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in is primarily due to the absence of any public offerings in  while cash provided from common stock issuances in may and december  resulted in net proceeds of million 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in cash provided by financing activities related to the exercise of warrants in  which resulted in net cash provided of million 
we believe that our current cash on hand as of december   the net proceeds from the january convertible notes offering of approximately million and revenue generated from commercial sales of provenge  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated expenditures for at least the next months as we expand our operations  including our manufacturing capabilities  continue our clinical trials  apply for regulatory approvals and build commercial infrastructure outside the us and invest in research and product development 
the majority of our resources continue to be used in support of the commercialization of provenge 
we expect revenue from provenge product sales could be a significant source of cash 
however  we may need to raise additional funds to meet potential additional long term liquidity needs for uses including the development of marketing  manufacturing  information technology and other infrastructure and activities related to the commercialization of provenge  working capital needs  increased personnel needs  continuing and expanding our internal research and development programs  and engaging in clinical trials outside of the us  commercial infrastructure development and other investment in order to support the commercialization of provenge in territories outside the united states
