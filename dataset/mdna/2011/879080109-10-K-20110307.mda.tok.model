item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information regarding our commercial industrial activity 
joint ventures we are also involved in multiple joint ventures with several partners 
our ta petro joint venture owns and operates two travel and truck stop facilities  and also operates three separate gas stations with convenience stores within trcc west and trcc east 
we are involved in two joint ventures with rockefeller development group  the five west parcel llc which owns a  square foot building in trcc west  which is partially leased  and the west llc which owns acres of land for future development within trcc west 
resort residential our resort residential segment activities include land planning and entitlement and land stewardship and conservation activities 
we have two major resort residential communities within this segment  one of which  tmv  received county entitlement approvals in that were reaffirmed by the kern county superior court in november  and one of which  the centennial community  is still progressing through the entitlement process in los angeles county 
the entitlement process precedes the regulatory approvals necessary for land development and routinely takes several years to complete 
the conservation agreement that we signed in is designed to minimize the opposition from environmental groups to these projects and eliminate or reduce the time spent in litigation once governmental approvals are received 
litigation by environmental groups has been a primary cause of delay and loss of financial value for real estate development projects in california 

table of contents centennial community the centennial development is a large master planned community development encompassing approximately  acres of our land within los angeles county 
upon completion of centennial  it is estimated that the community will include approximately  homes 
the community will also incorporate business districts  schools  retail and entertainment centers  medical facilities and other commercial office and light industrial businesses that  when complete  would create a substantial number of jobs 
centennial is being developed by centennial founders  llc  a consolidated joint venture in which we have a ownership interest as of december  our partners in this joint venture are pardee homes  lewis investment company and standard pacific corp 
in  our partners in centennial founders llc elected to become non contributing capital partners due to the financial difficulties facing homebuilders and the downturn within the real estate industry 
as a result  the company began funding of centennial founders llc s current operations  thereby diluting each other partner s percentage ownership 
this change in funding occurred in july prior to that time the company was contributing of the capital funds necessary to pursue entitlement and development efforts undertaken by this joint venture 
we expect to continue funding all entitlement and pre development activities for the near future 
since the initial submittal of our administrative level eir with respect to the centennial community to los angeles county  we have continued to receive feedback from the los angeles planning department and have submitted several revisions of our administrative eir as we work towards the public filing of our eir and final approval 
we cannot estimate when or if this approval will be granted  but the process is being actively pursued 
in addition to the eir  we have submitted a variety of other reports required as part of the entitlement process including our specific plan  tentative tract maps  geological reports  traffic reports  and water supply assessment reports 
centennial is envisioned to be an ecologically friendly and commercially viable development 
our plan is for a sustainable program that provides for the needs of the community while protecting the environment and will be achieved through our continuing focus on responsible use of limited resources and progressive construction design 
we recognize the need to balance expensive green program certifications with the practicality of investing those same funds in environmentally sound building elements 
tejon mountain village community in addition to the centennial community project  we are currently engaged in the development of tmv 
tmv is envisioned as an exclusive  very low density  resort based community that will provide owners and guests with a wide variety of recreational opportunities  lodging and spa facilities  world class golf facilities  a range of housing options  and other exclusive services and amenities that are designed to distinguish tmv as the resort of choice for the southern california market 
tmv is being developed by tmv llc  an unconsolidated joint venture in which we have a ownership interest 
our partner in this joint venture is dmb tmv llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of dmb associates inc  or dmb  which is a leading resort recreational planned community developer 
under the joint venture agreement  the parties have agreed to secure all entitlements and all necessary regulatory approvals  to master plan  develop and sell parcels and homes to end users  and to develop and own  sell or joint venture commercial properties  hotels  and golf course sites in tmv 
in  the company contributed rights to all studies  research  and other work that we had performed related to tmv to the joint venture and committed to contribute  or more acres comprising the tmv site at such time as entitlements are successfully obtained and litigated  while dmb committed up to a total of at least  to fund entitlement efforts and the beginning of development 
beginning in  based on the 
table of contents achievement of entitlement contribution levels by dmb  we began equal sharing of all funding requirements for entitlement and development activities with dmb 
in october  tmv received unanimous entitlement approval from the kern county board of supervisors which allows the company to commence development activities 
this approval began a thirty day period in which a ceqa lawsuit could be filed against kern county 
these lawsuits routinely allege inadequacy of the eir 
as expected  a group of parties led by cbd filed a suit in november alleging inadequacy of the eir 
in november  kern county superior court judge kenneth twissleman ruled in favor of the company  its development partner  and kern county when he found that kern county had properly analyzed and evaluated the environmental effects of tmv 
judge twissleman rejected claims made by cbd that our environmental impact report for tmv was inadequate 
the findings of judge twissleman were appealed by cbd on february  it is difficult to predict the ultimate timing of the settlement of the appeal or the eventual outcome of the appeal 
see item  legal proceedings  for a further discussion 
because our residential housing communities  centennial and tmv  are both in the entitlement phase  they have not been directly impacted by the downturn in the housing market over the last few years 
however  we cannot project the condition of the housing market or the stability of the mortgage industry if and when we have secured full entitlement for our projects  or when these projects move into their development and marketing phases 
these factors can impact the timing of beginning of development 
the sale and leasing of commercial industrial real estate is very competitive  with competition coming from numerous and varied sources around california 
the degree of competition has increased due to the current economic climate which has caused an oversupply of comparable real estate available for sale or lease due to the decline in demand as a result of the recent economic downturn and lack of active business expansion 
our ability to attract tenants due to preferential pricing is minimized due to price cutting by our most direct regional competitors in the inland empire region of southern california and areas north of us in the san joaquin valley of california 
the greatest competition for the centennial community will come from california developments in the santa clarita valley  lancaster  palmdale  and bakersfield 
tmv will compete generally for discretionary dollars that consumers will allocate to recreation and second homes  so its competition will range over a greater area and range of projects 
farming operations in the san joaquin valley  we farm permanent crops including the following acreage wine grapes  almonds  and pistachios  we manage the farming of alfalfa and forage mix on acres in the antelope valley and we periodically lease acres of land that is used for the growing of vegetables 
we sell our farm commodities to several commercial buyers 
as a producer of these commodities  we are in direct competition with other producers within the united states and throughout the world 
prices we receive for our commodities are determined by total industry production and demand levels 
we attempt to improve price margins by producing high quality crops through proven cultural practices and by obtaining better prices through marketing arrangements with handlers 

table of contents sales of our grape and pistachio crops typically occur in the third and fourth quarter of the calendar year  while sales of our almond crop also typically occur in the third and fourth quarter of the calendar year  but can occur up to a year or more after the crop is harvested 
in  we sold of our grape crop to one winery  to a second winery and the remainder to two other customers 
these sales are under long term contracts ranging from one to thirteen years 
in  our almonds were sold to various commercial buyers  with the two largest buyers accounting for and  respectively of our almond revenues 
in the majority of our pistachios were sold to two customers  purchasing approximately and of the crop  respectively 
we do not believe that we would be adversely affected by the loss of any or all of these large buyers because of the markets for these commodities  the large number of buyers that would be available to us  and the fact that the prices for these commodities do not vary based on the identity of the buyer or the size of the contract 
nut and grape crop markets are particularly sensitive to the size of each year s world crop and the demand for those crops 
large crops in california and abroad can rapidly depress prices 
crop prices  especially almonds  are also adversely affected by a strong us dollar which makes us exports more expensive and decreases demand for the products we produce 
the relatively weak value of the dollar over the last few years has helped to maintain strong almond prices in the us and in overseas markets 
our water entitlement for available from the california state water project  or swp  when combined with supplemental water  was adequate for our farming needs 
the state department of water resources  or dwr  has announced its early estimated water supply delivery at of full entitlement 
we anticipate that this current year allocation is sufficient for our farming needs 
it is possible that when the current swp allocation is combined with other available water resources  such as groundwater and surface sources  the company may be able to bank additional water in for future use

item a 
risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the company 
if any of the following risks occurs  our business  financial condition  results of operations or future prospects could be materially adversely affected 
our strategy  focused on more aggressive development of our land  involves significant risk and could result in operating losses 
we are involved in a cyclical industry and are affected by changes in general and local economic conditions 
the real estate development industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions  including employment levels availability of financing interest rates consumer confidence demand for the developed product  whether residential or industrial supply of similar product  whether residential or industrial the process of development of a project begins and financial and other resources are committed long before a real estate project comes to market  which could occur at a time when the real estate market is depressed 
it is also possible in a rural area like ours that no market for the project will develop as projected 
a downturn in national or regional economic conditions could continue to adversely impact our business 
the collapse of the housing market beginning in together with the crisis in the credit markets  resulted in a recession in the national economy 
at such times  potential home buyer and commercial real estate customers often defer or avoid real estate transactions due the substantial costs involved and uncertainties in the economic environment 
our future real estate sales  revenues  financial condition and results of operations could suffer as a result 
our business is especially sensitive to economic conditions in california  where all of our land is located 
while there have been signs of improvement in the economy  california as one of the hardest hit states in the recent economic downturn  could take longer to recover than the rest of the nation 
a prolonged downturn will continue to have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
higher interest rates and lack of available financing can have significant impacts on the real estate industry 
higher interest rates generally impact the real estate industry by making it harder 
table of contents for buyers to qualify for financing  which can lead to a decrease in the demand for residential  commercial or industrial sites 
any decrease in demand will negatively impact our proposed developments 
lack of available credit to finance real estate purchases can also negatively impact demand 
any downturn in the economy or consumer confidence can also be expected to result in reduced housing demand and slower industrial development  which would negatively impact the demand for land we are developing 
we are subject to various land use regulations and require governmental approvals and permits for our developments that could be denied 
in planning and developing our land  we are subject to various local  state  and federal statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations concerning zoning  infrastructure design  subdivision of land  and construction 
all of our new developments require amending existing general plan and zoning designations  so it is possible that our entitlement applications could be denied 
in addition  the zoning that ultimately is approved could include density provisions that would limit the number of homes and other structures that could be built within the boundaries of a particular area  which could adversely impact the financial returns from a given project 
in addition  many states  cities and counties including neighboring ventura county have in the past approved various slow growth or urban limit line measures 
if that were to occur in the jurisdictions governing the company s land use  our future real estate development activities could be significantly adversely affected 
third party litigation could increase the time and cost of our development efforts 
the land use approval processes we must follow to ultimately develop our projects have become increasingly complex 
moreover  the statutes  regulations and ordinances governing the approval processes provide third parties the opportunity to challenge the proposed plans and approvals 
as a result  the prospect of third party challenges to planned real estate developments provides additional uncertainties in real estate development planning and entitlements 
third party challenges in the form of litigation could result in denial of the right to develop  or would  by their nature  adversely affect the length of time and the cost required to obtain the necessary approvals 
in addition  adverse decisions arising from any litigation would increase the costs and length of time to obtain ultimate approval of a project and could adversely affect the design  scope  plans and profitability of a project 
we are subject to environmental regulations and opposition from environmental groups that could cause delays and increase the costs of our development efforts or preclude such development entirely 
environmental laws that apply to a given site can vary greatly according to the site s location and condition  present and former uses of the site  and the presence or absence of sensitive elements like wetlands and endangered species 
federal and state environmental laws also govern the construction and operation of our projects and require compliance with various environmental regulations  including analysis of the environmental impact of our projects and evaluation of our reduction in the projects carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions 
environmental laws and conditions may result in delays  cause us to incur additional costs for compliance  mitigation and processing land use applications  or preclude development in specific areas 
in addition  in california  third parties have the ability to file litigation challenging the approval of a project  which they usually do by alleging inadequate disclosure and mitigation of the environmental impacts of the project 
while we have worked with representatives of various environmental interests and wildlife agencies to minimize and mitigate the impacts of our planned projects  certain groups opposed to development have made clear they intend to oppose our projects vigorously  so litigation challenging their approval is expected 
the issues most commonly cited in opponents public comments include the poor air quality of the san joaquin 
table of contents valley air basin  potential impacts of projects on the california condor and other species of concern  the potential for our lands to function as wildlife movement corridors  potential impacts of our projects on traffic and air quality in los angeles county  emissions of greenhouse gases  water availability and criticism of proposed development in rural areas as being sprawl 
in addition  california has a specific statutory and regulatory scheme intended to reduce green house gas emissions in the state and current efforts to enact federal legislation to address climate change concerns could require further reductions in our projects carbon footprint in the future 
constriction of the credit markets could limit our ability to access capital and increase our cost of capital 
during the recent economic downturn  we have relied principally on positive operating cash flow and cash and investments to meet our current working capital needs 
a recent stock rights offering will be used to fund development and entitlement activities in the future 
while there has been signs of improvement in the economy  the ongoing economic and real estate downturn has reduced other sources of liquidity available to the industry  and may continue to limit these sources of liquidity in the future and potentially increase our costs of capital 
until governmental entitlements are received  we will have a limited inventory of real estate 
each of our four current and planned real estate projects  trcc west and east  centennial and tmv  involve obtaining various governmental permits and or entitlements 
a delay in obtaining governmental approvals could lead to additional costs related to these developments and potentially lost opportunities for the sale of lots to developers and land users 
we are in competition with several other developments for customers and residents 
within our real estate activities  we are in direct competition for customers with other industrial sites in northern  central  and southern california 
we are also in competition with other highway interchange locations using interstate and state route for commercial leasing opportunities 
once they receive all necessary approvals and entitlements  centennial will ultimately compete with other residential housing options in the region  such as developments in the santa clarita valley  lancaster  palmdale  bakersfield  and tmv will compete generally for discretionary dollars that consumers will allocate to recreation and second homes  so its competition will include a greater area and range of projects 
intense competition may decrease our sales and harm our results of operations 
our developable land is concentrated entirely in california 
all of our developable land is in california and our business is especially sensitive to the economic conditions within california  any adverse change in the economic climate of california  which is currently in an economic downturn  or our regions of that state  and any adverse change in the political or regulatory climate of california  or the counties where our land is located could adversely affect our real estate development activities 
there is no consensus as to when the economy will begin to improve or how long it could take the economy to recover from the continuing economic downturn 
ultimately  our ability to sell or lease lots may decline as a result of weak economic conditions or restrictive regulations 
we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect our prospects 
we currently depend heavily on the services of robert a 
stine  our president and chief executive officer  and a number of other key management personnel 
the loss of mr 
stine s services or that of other key personnel could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  or our ability to 
table of contents pursue land development 
our success will also depend in part on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel 
our business model is very dependent on transactions with strategic partners 
we may not be able to successfully attract desirable strategic partners  complete agreements with strategic partners  and or manage relationships with strategic partners going forward  any of which could adversely affect our business 
for several years a key to our development and value creation strategies has been the use of joint ventures and strategic relationships 
these joint venture partners bring development experience  industry expertise  financial resources  financing capabilities  brand recognition and credibility or other competitive assets 
a complicating factor in any joint venture is that strategic partners may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours or that are influenced by factors related to our business 
these competing interests lead to the difficult challenges of successfully managing the relationship and communication between strategic partners and monitoring the execution of the partnership plan 
we may also be subject to adverse business consequences if the market reputation or financial position of the strategic partner deteriorates 
if we cannot successfully execute transactions with strategic partners  our business could be adversely affected 
only a limited market exists for our common stock which could lead to price volatility 
the limited trading market for our common stock may cause fluctuations in the market value of our common stock to be exaggerated  leading to price volatility in excess of that which would occur in a more active trading market of our common stock 
concentrated ownership of our common stock creates a risk of sudden change in our share price 
as of february   directors and members of our executive management team beneficially owned or controlled approximately of our common stock 
investors who purchase our common stock may be subject to certain risks due to the concentrated ownership of our common stock 
the sale by any of our large shareholders of a significant portion of that shareholder s holdings could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the registration of any significant amount of additional shares of our common stock will have the immediate effect of increasing the public float of our common stock and any such increase may cause the market price of our common stock to decline or fluctuate significantly 
inflation can have a significant adverse effect on our operations 
inflation can have a major impact on our farming operations 
the farming operations are most affected by escalating costs  unpredictable revenues and very high irrigation water costs 
high fixed water costs related to our farm lands will continue to adversely affect earnings 
prices received for many of our products are dependent upon prevailing market conditions and commodity prices 
therefore  it is difficult for us to accurately predict revenue  just as we cannot pass on cost increases caused by general inflation  except to the extent reflected in market conditions and commodity prices 
within our real estate operations  inflation can result in increased costs of construction and can reduce operating margins as increases in operating costs result in deteriorating margins on long term fixed lease agreements 
a prolonged downturn in the real estate market or continued instability in the mortgage and commercial real estate financing industry  could have an adverse effect on our real estate 
table of contents business 
our residential housing projects  centennial and tmv  are currently in the entitlement phase  and therefore they have not been impacted by the current downturn in the housing market or the mortgage lending crisis 
however  if the downturn in the real estate market or the instability in the mortgage and commercial real estate financing industry exists at the time these projects move into their development and marketing phases  our resort residential business could be adversely affected 
excess supply of homes available due to foreclosures or the expectation of deflation in housing prices could also have a negative impact on our ability to sell our inventory when it becomes available 
the inability of potential commercial industrial clients to get adequate financing for the expansion of their businesses could lead to reduced lease revenues and sales of land within our industrial development 
we may encounter other risks that could impact our ability to develop our land 
we may also encounter other difficulties in developing our land  including difficulty in securing adequate water resources for future developments  natural risks  such as geological and soil problems  earthquakes  fire  heavy rains and flooding  and heavy winds  shortages of qualified trades people  reliance on local contractors  who may be inadequately capitalized  shortages of materials  and increases in the cost of materials

unresolved staff comments none 
item properties our approximate  acres include portions of the san joaquin valley  portions of the tehachapi mountains and portions of the western end of the antelope valley 
a number of key transportation and utility facilities cross our land  including interstate  california highways  and  the california aqueduct which brings water from northern california  and various transmission lines for electricity  oil  natural gas and communication systems 
our corporate offices are located on our property 
approximately  acres of our land are located in kern county  california 
the kern county general plan  or the general plan  for this land contemplates continued commercial  resource utilization  farming  grazing and other agricultural uses  as well as certain new developments and uses  including residential and recreational facilities 
while the general plan is intended to provide general guidelines for land use and development  it is subject to amendment to accommodate changing circumstances and needs 
in addition to conforming to any amendment of the general plan  much of our land will require specific zoning and site plan approvals prior to actual development 
the remainder of our land  approximately  acres  is in los angeles county 
this area is accessible from interstate via highway los angeles county has adopted general plan policies that contemplate future residential development of portions of this land  subject to further assessments of environmental and infrastructure constraints 
we are currently pursuing 
table of contents entitlements for the centennial master planned community on approximately  acres of this land 
see item  business real estate operations 
portions of our land consist of mountainous terrain  much of which is not presently served by paved roads or by utility or water lines 
much of this property is included within the conservation agreement 
as we receive entitlement approvals over the life span of our developments we will dedicate conservation easements on  acres of this land  which will preclude future development of the land 
this acreage includes many of the most environmentally sensitive areas of our property and is home to many plant and wildlife species whose environments will remain undisturbed 
any significant development on our currently undeveloped land would involve the construction of roads  utilities and other expensive infrastructure and would have to be done in a manner that accommodates a number of environmental concerns  including endangered species  wetlands issues  and greenhouse gas emissions  which may limit development of portions of the land or result in substantial delays or certain changes to the scope of development in order to obtain governmental approval 
water operations our existing long term water contracts with the wheeler ridge maricopa water storage district  or wheeler ridge  provide for water entitlements and deliveries from the swp  to our agricultural operations in the san joaquin valley 
the terms of these contracts extend to under the contracts  we are entitled to annual water for  acres of land  which is adequate for our present farming operations 
it is assumed  that at the end of the current contract period all water contracts will be extended for approximately the same amount of annual water 
in addition to our agricultural contract water entitlements  we have an additional water entitlement from the swp sufficient to service a substantial amount of future residential and or commercial development in kern county 
the tejon castac water district  or tcwd  a local water district serving only our land and land we have sold in trcc  has  acre feet of swp entitlement 
in addition  tcwd has approximately  acre feet of water stored in kern county water banks 
both the entitlement and the banked water are the subject of a long term water supply contract extending to between tcwd and our company 
tcwd is the principal water supplier to trcc  and would be the principal water supplier for any significant residential and recreational development in tmv 
we have constructed a acre water bank consisting of nine ponds on our land in southern kern county 
water is pumped into these ponds and then percolates into underground aquifers 
since  we have purchased  acre feet of water from the antelope valley east kern water agency  or avek  which has been pumped from the california aqueduct and is currently retained in this water bank 
in and we contracted for  additional acre feet of water from avek  but have deferred delivery of the water to a future year 
we anticipate adding additional water to the water bank in the future as water is available 
in we began participating in the newly formed avek in lieu water banking program and we have acre feet of water to our credit in this program 
in recent years we have also been purchasing water for our future use or sale 
in we purchased  acre feet of transferable water and in we purchased an additional  acre 
table of contents feet of transferable water  all of which is currently held on our behalf by avek 
we are also eligible to receive water under long term swp water contract agreements that we have with the tulare lake water district and the dudley ridge water district 
these contracts are to supply annually  acre feet of water  subject to swp allocations  and the contracts extend through during  swp allocations were  and wheeler ridge was able to supply us with of our farming demands through supplemental water it provided principally from water banks 
in some years  there is also sufficient runoff from local mountain streams to allow us to capture some of this water in reservoirs and utilize it to offset some of the swp water 
both wheeler ridge and tcwd are able to bank percolate into underground aquifers some of their excess supplies for future use 
at this time  wheeler ridge expects to be able to deliver our entire contract water entitlement in any year that the swp deliveries exceed by drawing on its ground water wells and water banking assets 
based on historical records of water availability  we do not believe we have material problems with our water supply 
however  if swp deliveries are less than of our entitlement in any year  or if shortages continue for a sustained period of several years  then wheeler ridge may not be able to deliver of our entitlement and we will have to rely on our own ground water sources  mountain stream runoff  water transfer from others  and water banking assets to supply the needs of our farming and development activities 
water from these sources may be more expensive than swp water because of pumping costs and or transfer costs 
a preliminary swp water allocation has been made by the dwr for all swp water contracts require annual payments related to the fixed costs of the swp and each water district  whether or not water is used or available 
wheeler ridge contracts also establish a lien on benefited land 
portions of our property also have available groundwater which we believe would be sufficient to supply commercial development in the interstate corridor 
ground water in the antelope valley basin is the subject of litigation 
see item  legal proceedings for additional information about this litigation 
there have been many environmental challenges regarding the movement of state project water through the sacramento delta 
these challenges resulted in a temporary court ordered shut down of the delta pumps  which are of primary importance to the california water system because these pumps are part of the system that moves water from northern california to southern california 
new biological opinions  or bos  issued by the us fish and wildlife service and national marine fisheries service in and contain similar restrictions on pumping from the delta 
these bos are being challenged in the courts by both water agencies and environmental groups 
judge wanger of the federal district court  eastern district of california  has determined that parts of the new bos related to the delta smelt are insufficient and remanded the bos back to the us fish and wildlife service for further analysis 
there are many groups  governmental and private  working together to develop a solution in the near future to alleviate the curtailment of water from the delta 
historic swp restrictions on the right to use agricultural water entitlement for municipal purposes were removed in  and the parties to a lawsuit challenging such removal have agreed to a settlement which would allow such removal to continue while the environmental impacts are studied 
for this purpose  municipal use includes residential and industrial use 
therefore  although only  of tejon castac s  acre feet of entitlement are labeled for municipal use  
table of contents there is no practical restriction on tejon castac s ability to deliver the remaining water to residential or commercial industrial developments 
in the near term  for political and regulatory reasons  it is unlikely that we would be able to direct any of our wheeler ridge agricultural entitlement to municipal or industrial uses 
other activities the tejon ranch public facilities financing authority  or trpffa  is a joint powers authority formed by kern county and tcwd to finance public infrastructure within the company s kern county developments 
trpffa has created two community facilities districts  or cfds  the west cfd and the east cfd 
the west cfd has placed liens on  acres of the company s land to secure payment of special taxes related to  of bond debt sold by trpffa for trcc west 
the east cfd has placed liens on  acres of the company s land to secure payments of special taxes related to  of bond debt sold by trpffa for trcc east 
at trcc west  the west cfd has no additional bond debt approved for issuance 
at trcc east  the east cfd has approximately  of additional bond debt authorized by trpffa 
proceeds from the sales of these bonds are to reimburse the company for public infrastructure related to trcc east 
in  we received  of reimbursement from these bond funds and in we received  of reimbursement from these funds 
in  we did not receive any reimbursement from these bond funds 
in   and  we paid approximately   and  respectively  in special taxes related to the cfds 
as development continues to occur at trcc  new owners of land and new lease tenants  through triple net leases  will bear an increasing portion of the assessed special tax 
as this happens  our obligation is reduced 
it is expected that we will have special tax payments in of approximately  but this could change in the future based on the amount of bonds outstanding within each cfd and the amount of taxes paid by other owners and tenants 
as development and values increase around trcc  we may be able to have approximately  acres released from west cfd liens 
item legal proceedings tejon mountain village on october   the kern county board of supervisors granted entitlement approval for tmv 
on november   a group consisting of cbd  wishtoyo foundation  tri county watchdogs and the center on race  poverty and the environment filed an action in kern superior court under the california environmental quality act  or ceqa  against kern county and the kern county board of supervisors  or collectively  the county  concerning the county s granting of approval for tmv  including the certification of the environmental impact report  or eir  approval of associated general plan amendments  adoption of associated zoning maps  adoption of special plan no

an order of the rwqcb directs lafarge  national and the company to clean up contamination from a diesel fuel tank and pipeline 
the company is advised that lafarge and national have substantially completed the groundwater cleanup and that groundwater monitoring remains an on going activity 
to date  the company is not aware of any failure by lafarge or national to comply with the orders or informal requests of the rwqcb 
under current and prior leases  national and lafarge are obligated to indemnify the company for costs and liabilities arising directly or indirectly out of their use of the leased premises 
the company believes that all of the matters described above are included within the scope of the national or lafarge indemnity obligations and that lafarge and national have sufficient resources to perform any reasonably likely obligations relating to these matters 
if they do not and the company is required to perform the work at its own cost  it is unlikely that the amount of any such expenditure by the company would be material 
antelope valley groundwater cases on november   a complaint was filed asking for the antelope valley groundwater basin to be adjudicated by the los angeles superior court 
this complaint sought to have the rights of all parties overlying the basin  including the company s land  should be fixed based on various principles of water law and on negotiations among the principal parties or groups of water users 
the case is currently in the third phase of a multi phase trial  therefore  it is too early to ascertain what effect  if any  this case may have on the centennial project or the company s remaining lands in the antelope valley 
because the water supply plan for the centennial project includes several sources of water in addition to groundwater underlying the company s lands  and because the creation of an efficient market for local water rights is frequently an outcome of adjudication proceedings  we anticipate that sufficient water to supply the company s needs will continue to be available for its use regardless of the outcome of this case

we are a diversified real estate development and agribusiness company committed to responsibly using our land and resources to meet the housing  employment  and lifestyle needs of californians and to create value for our shareholders 
in support of these objectives  we have been investing in land planning and entitlement activities for new industrial and residential land developments and in infrastructure improvements within our active industrial development 
our prime asset is approximately  acres of contiguous  largely undeveloped land that  at its most southerly border  is miles north of los angeles and  at its most northerly border  is miles east of bakersfield 
our business model is designed to create value through the entitlement and development of land for commercial industrial and resort residential uses while at the same time protecting significant portions of our land for conservation purposes 
we operate our business near one of the country s largest population centers  which is expected to continue to grow well into the future 
we currently operate in three business segments commercial industrial real estate development and services  resort residential real estate development  and farming 
our commercial industrial real estate development and services generates revenues from building  grazing  and land lease activities  land and building sales  oil and mineral royalties and ancillary land management activities 
the primary commercial industrial development is trcc 
the resort residential segment is actively involved in the land entitlement and development process internally and through joint venture entities 
its revenues are generated through farming activities within the centennial joint venture 
within our resort residential segment  the two active developments are tmv and the centennial master planned community 
farming produces revenues from the sale of winegrapes  almonds  and pistachios 
the conservation agreement we entered into with five of the major environmental organizations in june calls for the permanent protection of up to  acres of our land through phased dedicated conservation easements on approximately  acres of our land   acres of open space within permitted project areas  and the purchase of conservation easements on an additional  acres of our land that was completed during february during  we recognized net income of  compared to a net loss of  in  an increase of 
the significant improvement in net income is largely the result of higher farming revenues and an overall reduction in operating expenses 
the reduction in operating expenses included a significant reversal of stock compensation expense of  during  revenues grew to  from  in the primary driver of the increase in revenues was an increase of  in farming revenues due primarily to an increase in pistachio production and prices in compared to commercial industrial revenues also grew by  in when compared to due to higher oil royalties  a land sale  and increased ancillary service revenues 
compared to  expenses from operations 
table of contents declined  in to  due to the reversal of stock compensation expenses related to the modification of existing performance grants and lower operating costs 
for we had a net loss of  compared to net income of  in  a decline of 
the decline in net income resulted from decreased commercial industrial revenues  a decline in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures and reduced other income 
these declines were partially offset by lower operating expenses in the real estate segments and corporate operations 
in  revenues from operations fell  to  when compared to the primary driver of the decline in revenue was a reduction in commercial revenues of  resulting primarily from the absence of sales of developed and undeveloped land  when compared to we also experienced declines in oil royalties and a drop in percentage and straight line rents from our power plant lease with calpine 
expenses from operations decreased  in to  compared to the prior year largely due to the absence of cost of sales of land and a decline in corporate expenses 
the decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was the result of a decrease in earnings from our ta petro joint venture due to increased operating expenses and a decrease in earnings of our five west parcel joint venture as the building it owns and leases was partially vacant during the year 
corporate expenses declined in due to reduced compensation costs 
during  we plan to continue to invest funds in our joint ventures and internally toward the achievement of entitlements for our land and for infrastructure development within our active industrial developments 
the process of securing entitlements for our land is a long  arduous process which can take several years 
the conservation agreement is designed to help minimize future legal delays that are often a part of this process 
during the next few years  our net income will fluctuate from year to year based upon commodity prices  production within our farming segment  and the timing of sales of land and the leasing of land within our industrial developments 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provides a narrative discussion of our results of operations 
it contains the results of operations for each operating segment of the business and is followed by a discussion of our financial position 
it is useful to read the business segment information in conjunction with note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made  and changes in the estimates that are likely to occur from period to period  or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  capitalization of costs  profit recognition related to land sales  stock compensation  our future ability to utilize deferred tax assets  and defined benefit retirement plans 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
see also note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements revenue recognition the company s revenue is primarily derived from lease revenue from our rental portfolio  royalty revenue from mineral leases  sales of farm crops  and land sales 
revenue from leases with rent concessions or fixed escalations is recognized on a straight line basis over the initial term of the related lease unless there is a considerable risk as to collectability 
the financial terms of leases are contractually defined 
lease revenue is not accrued when a tenant vacates the premises and ceases to make rent payments or files for bankruptcy 
royalty revenues are contractually defined as to the percentage of royalty and are tied to production and market prices 
our royalty arrangements generally require payment on a monthly basis with the payment based on the previous month s activity 
we accrue monthly royalty revenues based upon estimates and adjust to actual as we receive payments 
in recognizing revenue from land sales  the company follows the provisions in accounting standards codification  or asc  real estate retail land to record these sales 
asc provides specific sales recognition criteria to determine when land sales revenue can be recorded 
for example  asc requires a land sale to be consummated with a sufficient down payment of at least to of the sales price depending upon the type and timeframe for development of the property sold  and that any receivable from the sale cannot be subject to future subordination 
in addition  the seller cannot retain any material continuing involvement in the property sold  or be required to develop the property in the future or construct facilities or off site improvements 
we fully recognized the revenues from all land sales in and in as none of the requirements for deferral of revenue were present 
there were no land sales in at the time farm crops are harvested  contracted  and delivered to buyers and revenues can be estimated  revenues are recognized and any related inventoried costs are expensed  which traditionally occurs during the third and fourth quarters of each year 
it is not unusual for portions of our almond crop to be sold in the year following the harvest 
orchard almond and pistachio revenues are based upon the contract settlement price or estimated selling price  whereas vineyard revenues are recognized at the contracted selling price 
estimated prices for orchard crops are based upon the quoted estimate of what the final market price will be by marketers and handlers of the orchard crops 
this method of recognizing revenues on the sale of orchard crops is a standard practice within the agribusiness community 
for the orchard crops  we estimated almond revenue to be  or per pound on average  and pistachio revenue to be  or per pound on average 
these estimates not only impact the recorded revenues within our farming segment but also our recorded accounts receivable at december  over the last three years  prices received on almonds have ranged from to per pound 
pistachio prices over the last three years have ranged from to per pound 
if we were to assume that our above estimates for orchard crop revenues were changed to the upper end or lower end of the range we developed in the course of 
table of contents formulating our estimate  orchard crop revenues would have been reduced or increased by approximately  or of the total revenue estimate 
our final estimates were based on the midpoint of a range in which the upper and lower ends of the range were from the midpoint 
as an example  the range for almonds in was to per pound 
if we were to change our estimate of orchard crop revenues to the low end of the estimated range  there would be no material impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
actual final orchard crop selling prices are not determined for several months following the close of our fiscal year due to supply and demand fluctuations within the orchard crop markets 
adjustments for differences between original estimates and actual revenues received are recorded during the period in which such amounts become known 
the net effect of these adjustments increased farming revenue by   and  in  and  respectively 
the adjustment for includes  related to pistachios due to an improving price market resulting from low industry inventories  and  from almonds as increased demand pushed prices higher 
the adjustment in was due to  in additional bonus payments and price adjustments on pistachios and  in adjustments related to almonds as prices continued to increase prior to the contract settlement 
the large adjustment in was due to bonus payments received on pistachios of  and  from continuing price increases for almonds 
capitalization of cost the company capitalizes direct construction and development costs  including predevelopment costs  interest  property taxes  insurance  and indirect project costs that are clearly associated with the acquisition  development  or construction of a project 
costs currently capitalized that in the future would be related to any abandoned development opportunities will be written off if we determine such costs do not provide any future benefits 
should development activity decrease  a portion of interest  property taxes  and insurance costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization  and would be expensed as incurred 
allocation of costs related to land sales and leases when we sell or lease land within one of our real estate developments and we have not completed all infrastructure development related to the total project  we follow asc  real estate retail land  to determine the appropriate costs of sales for the sold land and the timing of recognition of the sale 
in the calculation of cost of sales or allocations to leased land  we use estimates and forecasts to determine total costs at completion of the development project 
these estimates of final development costs can change as conditions in the market and costs of construction change 
in preparing these estimates  we use internal budgets  forecasts  and engineering reports to help us estimate future costs related to infrastructure that has not been completed 
these estimates become more accurate as the development proceeds forward  due to historical cost numbers and to the continued refinement of the development plan 
these estimates are updated periodically throughout the year so that  at the ultimate completion of development  all costs have been allocated 
during  per square foot of cost was allocated to land sold in trcc east and in  and  per square foot of cost was allocated to land that was sold  leased  or contributed to joint ventures  as the cost of development at trcc west 
costs for land within trcc east on a going forward basis are currently estimated at per square foot 
any increases to this estimate in future years will negatively impact net profits and liquidity due to an increased need for funds to complete development 
if  however  this estimate decreases  net profits as well as liquidity will improve 
we believe that the estimates used related to cost of sales and allocations to leased land is a critical accounting estimate and will become even more significant as we continue to move forward as a real estate development company 
the estimates used are very susceptible to change from period 
table of contents to period  due to the fact that they require management to make assumptions about costs of construction  absorption of product  and timing of project completion  and changes to these estimates could have a material impact on the recognition of profits from the sale of land within our developments 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our property and equipment and development projects for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets contained in our financial statements may not be recoverable 
the impairment calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows undiscounted 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we calculate an impairment loss 
the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value  which may be based on estimated future cash flows discounted 
we recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value 
if we recognize an impairment loss  the adjusted carrying amount of the asset will be its new cost basis 
for a depreciable long lived asset  the new cost basis will be depreciated amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset 
restoration of a previously recognized impairment loss is prohibited 
we currently operate in three segments  commercial industrial real estate development  resort residential real estate development  and farming 
at this time  there are no assets within either of our real estate segments or our farming segment that we believe are in danger of being impaired due to market conditions 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because it is very susceptible to change from period to period  it requires management to make assumptions about future prices  production  and costs  and the potential impact of a loss from impairment could be material to our earnings 
management s assumptions regarding future cash flows from real estate developments and farming operations have fluctuated in the past due to changes in prices  absorption  production and costs and are expected to continue to do so in the future as market conditions change 
in estimating future prices  absorption  production  and costs  we use our internal forecasts and business plans 
we develop our forecasts based on recent sales data  historical absorption and production data  input from marketing consultants  as well as discussions with commercial real estate brokers and potential purchasers of our farming products 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 
defined benefit retirement plans the plan obligations and related assets of our defined benefit retirement plan are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments  are valued using level one indicators which are market prices for the investments 
pension benefit obligations and the related effects on operations are calculated using actuarial models 
the estimation of our pension obligations  costs and liabilities requires that we make use of estimates of present value of the projected future payments to all participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors discount rates  
table of contents salary growth  retirement rates  expected contributions  inflation  expected return on plan assets  and mortality rates the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
in determining the discount rate  the company utilizes the yield on high quality  fixed income investments currently available with maturities corresponding to the anticipated timing of the benefit payments 
salary increase assumptions are based upon historical experience and anticipated future management actions 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets 
at december   the weighted average actuarial assumption of the company s domestic plans consisted of a discount rate of  a long term rate of return on plan assets of  and assumed salary increases of 
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income  net of tax 
amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income are adjusted as they are subsequently recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost 
if we were to assume a basis point change in the discount rate used  our projected benefit obligation would change approximately  stock based compensation we apply the recognition and measurement principles of asc  compensation retirement benefits in accounting for long term stock based incentive plans 
our stock based compensation plans have historically included both stock options and stock grants 
we have not issued any stock options to employees or directors since january  and our financial statements do not reflect any compensation expenses for stock options 
all of our stock options are fully vested and all related expenses were recognized in prior year financial statements per gaap 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  stock option plan  for additional information regarding stock options 
we also make stock awards to employees based upon time based criteria and through the achievement of performance related objectives 
performance related objectives are either stratified into threshold  target  and maximum goals or based on the achievement of a milestone event 
these stock awards are currently being expensed over the expected vesting period based on each performance criterion 
we make estimates as to the number of shares that will actually be granted based upon estimated ranges of success in meeting the defined performance measures 
if our estimates of performance shares vesting were to change by  stock compensation expense would increase or decrease by  depending on whether the change in estimate increased or decreased shares vesting 
beginning in the first quarter of  the compensation committee of the board of directors  or the board  conducted a compensation study prepared by an outside consultant 
one of the outcomes of the compensation study was that in september the board elected to modify selected outstanding and unvested performance milestone grants  or the existing performance milestone grants  and issue additional milestone performance grants  to employees selected by the board  or the new performance milestone grants 
the board determined that the development milestones that were outlined in the existing performance milestone grants continue to be the appropriate measurements for vesting purposes of the modified existing and new performance milestone grants 
the company has assessed that it is probable that these 
table of contents performance milestones will be met  although  with respect to a portion of the existing performance milestone grants  not within the timeframe required under those grants as discussed below 
as discussed above  the performance milestone grants approved by the board in september  included the modification of existing performance milestone grants totaling  restricted stock units and the issuance of new performance milestone grants totaling an additional  restricted stock units 
with respect to the existing performance milestones grants  the modification of  restricted stock units has been accounted for as an improbable to probable modification since the company determined that it would not have been able to achieve the performance milestones within the original timeframe set forth under those grants  which required achievement by the end of as such  the previous stock compensation expense recognized with respect to those existing performance milestone grants has been reversed as discussed more fully below  and the fair value of these modified performance milestone grants is being recognized over the new requisite service period 
with respect to the remaining portion of the existing performance milestone shares granted  the modification of those  restricted stock unit has been accounted for as a probable to probable modification as the company continues to believe that it is probable that we will achieve the vesting criteria for these grants both before and after the modification 
the unamortized total cost relating to these probable to probable modified performance milestone grants is being recognized ratably over the new requisite service period 
the impact of modifying the exiting performance milestone grants is a reversal of prior stock compensation expense of  during the year ended december  as part of its analysis to determine the appropriate accounting for the modification of the existing performance milestone grants  the company concluded that it should have reversed in the stock compensation expense related to  restricted stock units of the total  restricted stock units accounted for as an improbable to probable modification  as discussed above  since the time element restriction of the development milestone objective was not going to be met 
this error resulted in an overstatement of stock compensation expense of approximately  for the year ended december  in accordance with the relevant guidance  management evaluated the materiality of the error from a qualitative and quantitative perspective 
based on such evaluation  the company concluded that correcting the error would be immaterial to the expected results for the current year financial statements and correcting the error would not have had a material impact on any individual prior period financial statements or affect the trend of financial results 
accordingly  the company recorded an adjustment during the third quarter of to reverse the associated stock compensation 
the correction is included in the  stock compensation reversal explained above 
during  based on current estimates of future operating results and cash flow projections  we reversed  of performance based stock compensation expenses that had been recorded in prior years operating results because it is was no longer likely that these shares would vest 
we also adjusted future expenses for other stock awards based on our current estimates of future results 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  stock compensation plan  for total stock compensation expense related to stock grants 

table of contents fair value measurements fasb s authoritative guidance for fair value measurements of certain financial instruments defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined as the exchange exit price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
this guidance establishes a three level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability 
observable inputs are those which can be easily seen by market participants while unobservable inputs are generally developed internally  utilizing management s estimates and assumptions level valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities 
level valuation is determined from quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  or by model based techniques in which all significant inputs are observable in the market 
level valuation is derived from model based techniques in which at least one significant input is unobservable and based on our own estimates about the assumptions that market participants would use to value the asset or liability 
when available  we use quoted market prices in active markets to determine fair value 
we consider the principal market and nonperformance risk associated with our counterparties when determining the fair value measurement 
fair value measurements are used for marketable securities  investments within the pension plan and hedging instruments 
new accounting standards there are no recently issued accounting standards that are expected to have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations in future periods 
results of operations by segment we evaluate the performance of our operating segments separately to monitor the different factors affecting financial results 
each segment is subject to review and evaluation as we monitor current market conditions  market opportunities  and available resources 
the performance of each segment is discussed below real estate commercial industrial our commercial industrial segment profits during increased to  a  improvement  when compared to segment profits 
the increase in segment profits was largely driven by the following favorable variances  decrease in expenses when compared to primarily due to the reversal of  in stock compensation expense resulting from modification of performance milestone awards in and the write off of  of historical costs incurred on an abandoned building expansion project in   higher royalties received on oil leases as oil prices increased compared to this improvement was partially offset by lower production 
oil prices averaged based on kern county crude oil prices during compared to in while average production decreased by  barrels in when compared to  
table of contents  increase in land management ancillary service revenues when compared to due to higher game management memberships because of an increase in demand and higher landscape maintenance fees charged to tenants   gain on a land sale in in trcc east to a company that has plans to build a microtel hotel next to the new ta travel center  and  recognition of income from a forfeited purchase option deposit 
the above increases in revenues and decline in expenses were partially offset by a  decrease in mineral royalties in compared to as the demand for rock aggregate decreased reflecting the continued decline in the construction industry during we expect any continuation of the slow global and california economic recovery to have a negative impact on commercial industrial revenues in by limiting future leasing and sales activities 
the slow recovery in the real estate industry is continuing to cause a lack of demand for new construction  and sales and leasing of industrial products 
recent increases in the price of oil over the last few months could positively impact our revenues during our marketing efforts for trcc east and west continue to focus on educating potential users about the logistical benefits of our site and the success that current tenants and owners within our development have experienced 
we believe california s long term projected population growth will help to drive increases in industrial activity at trcc once the economic environment improves 
our development strategy has fit well with the logistics model that companies have been using  which favors larger single site buildings rather than a number of decentralized smaller distribution centers 
buildings of million square feet or larger are difficult to build in los angeles due to the number of acres necessary for a building of that size 
our ability to provide land parcels to support buildings of that size provides us with a potential marketing advantage 
a potential disadvantage to our development strategy is our distance from the port of los angeles in comparison to the traditional warehouse distribution centers east of los angeles 
the downturn in the economy and slow economic rebound continue to have an adverse impact on our ability to sell or lease our industrial commercial product 
the sharp downturn in economic activity over the last few years resulted in a marked decrease in potential tenant interest 
contraction of business operations has resulted in lower prices and significant competition for available warehouse space in the inland empire and other los angeles metropolitan areas 
this increased competition has negatively impacted our pricing advantages  and the lack of corporate business expansion due to future economic uncertainties has decreased demand for our buildings and land in the near term 
although  we have begun to see more interest in our development products thus far in we expect the commercial industrial segment to continue to experience costs  net of amounts capitalized  primarily related to professional service fees  marketing costs  commissions  planning costs  and staffing costs as we continue to increase real estate activities and pursue development opportunities 
the actual timing and completion of development is difficult to predict due to the uncertainties of the market 
infrastructure development and marketing activities and costs could continue over several years as we develop our land holdings 
we will also continue to evaluate land resources to determine the highest and best uses for our land holdings 
future sales of land are dependent on market circumstances and specific opportunities 
our goal in the future is to increase land value and create future revenue growth through planning and development of commercial and industrial properties 

table of contents our commercial industrial segment profits during decreased to  a  or decline  when compared to segment profits 
this decrease in segment profits was driven by the absence of land sales in compared to  and decreased royalties received on oil leases as oil production and prices fell compared to the record highs reached in the absence of land sales in accounted for a decline of  in the profitability of this segment compared to land sales profitability in in  land sales margins increased  compared to land sales profitability in 
in oil and mineral royalty margins decreased  overall compared to  with oil royalties decreasing by  and gas royalties decreasing by  while cement  sand and rock royalties decreased  oil production in decreased approximately  barrels compared to production while prices decreased per barrel on average compared to the prior year 
oil lease delay payments which are made to reserve future drilling rights on our land also declined as these parcels were developed into exploration wells 
mineral royalties declined as the demand for rock aggregate decreased reflecting the continued decline in the construction industry during a reduction in percentage rents and the reversal of straight line rental revenues from our calpine lease accounted for an additional decrease of  while ancillary land use revenues fell  as the constricted economy had a negative impact on revenue lines which are dependent on consumer discretionary spending 
these declines in revenue were partially offset by reduced expenses of  the absence of land sales resulted in a reduction in cost of sales in for land of  and a reduction in land sale related professional service costs of  the other major contributors to the reduction in expenses were an overall decline of  achieved through lower expenditures for materials and supplies  repairs and maintenance  travel  memberships  subscriptions and marketing programs at trcc  and fuel costs  which fell compared to as prices for gasoline and underlying services dropped 
we abandoned a potential building expansion project in and wrote off the  of historical costs incurred on the project which increased current year costs and reduced the overall cost savings achieved by this segment 
see item  business real estate operations for a further discussion of real estate development activities 
real estate resort residential the resort residential segment had an operating loss of  in  an improvement of  or when compared to the prior year 
the decreased loss in was primarily due to the reversal of  in stock compensation expense resulting from the modification of performance milestone awards  as discussed above 
our resort residential segment activities include land planning and entitlement activities related to our potential residential developments  which include the centennial master planned community and tmv 
each of our resort residential projects is being developed through a joint venture 
the intent of such joint venture agreements is to provide a source of capital and allow the significant costs and business risks inherent in these projects to be shared with our venture partners 
during our joint venture agreement with our centennial founders partners was amended to allow our partners to cease capital contributions during the entitlement phase of the project allowing us to continue as the sole funding participant 
in exchange for non contributing status  these partners percentage ownership interests are diluted by a to ratio with regard to the amount of capital contributed on such partner s behalf 
as a result of this partnership amendment  the results of operations of the centennial founders joint venture are now consolidated within our financial statements 
during  we signed a conservation agreement with five major environmental organizations 
the organizations that signed the conservation agreement will not oppose our current residential developments 
these developments will continue to be subject to the regulatory requirements that are a part of the entitlement process and could be opposed by other parties 

table of contents however  we believe the conservation agreement will be beneficial in reducing future legal opposition and delays 
we expect near term activities within this segment to be focused on obtaining entitlements for the centennial project  located in los angeles county  defending the legal challenges to the tmv eir  and stewardship activities 
the resort residential segment will continue to incur costs in the future related to professional service fees  public relations costs  and staffing costs as we continue the entitlement process for the above communities and continue to meet our obligations under the conservation agreement 
the actual timing and completion of entitlement related activities is difficult to predict due to the uncertainties of the approval process and the possibility of litigation upon approval of our entitlements in the future 
we will also continue to evaluate land resources to determine the highest and best use for our land holdings 
our long term goal through this process is to increase the value of our land and create future revenue opportunities through resort and residential development 
since we are in the process of achieving entitlements for our centennial community  we do not have a fully approved project and therefore we do not have inventory for sale in the current market 
we received entitlement approval for our tmv community during and affirmation of these approvals in november from the kern county superior court 
the court s decision has been appealed 
although this legal challenge does not preclude us from commencing the development of tmv  we generally believe it is more prudent to have lawsuits settled or finally determined before beginning development 
we are continuously monitoring the markets in order to identify the appropriate time in the future to begin infrastructure improvements and lot sales 
our long term business plan of developing the communities of centennial and tmv remains unchanged 
the housing industry downturn has impacted the perception of current land values due to the numerous write downs home builders took in previous years regarding land inventory 
we believe this perception of decreasing current land values has impacted our stock price but does not diminish the long term fundamentals which support housing demand  primarily california population growth and household formation both of which remain positive 
however  it is not possible to predict how long the negative effects of the current market conditions will persist and if we will experience further deterioration from current levels or if conditions will improve 
the resort residential segment had an operating loss of  in  an improvement of  or when compared to the prior year 
the decreased loss in was the result of recognition of  of revenue from the centennial founders partnership and containment of expenses even after the consolidation of centennial operations 
the primary drivers behind the containment of expenses were a  reduction in the public relations costs and a  overall reduction in compensation costs  net of amounts capitalized  as savings from staff reductions and decreased incentive compensation cost were recognized 
routine fuel  repairs and maintenance  travel and leasing costs declined as cost reduction efforts were implemented 
these cost savings were partially offset by increased contract and professional services costs as capitalized project costs are replaced by expensed implementation costs of the ranch wide agreement 
the centennial founders joint venture expenses of  also represent an increase in costs compared to as is the first year of consolidation of this joint venture 
see item  business real estate operations for a further discussion of real estate development activities 

table of contents farming farming segment profits were  in  an increase of  or when compared to the prior year 
the significant increase is primarily driven by a significant increase in pistachio and winegrapes revenues  partially offset by lower almond revenues 
in  pistachio revenues increased  or  to  pistachio yields increased  pounds in compared to this increase in production was an unexpected yield for an off production year 
this improvement in production was largely due to the near perfect weather during the pollination period for the trees 
this resulted in a significant increase in the pounds available for sale compared to our estimate and the prior year production 
in addition to the increase in yield  the average price per pound increased  or  to per pound in from per pound in the price increase for pistachios is attributable to a worldwide crop shortage 
given the crop size  we expect the crop to reset itself to an off production year 
grape revenues for the crop increased  or  to  as compared to due to increased production 
in  grape production increased approximately tons  or  as compared to  as production volumes improved within existing vineyards and a new vineyard became productive 
we have long term contracts for our grape crops ranging from one to thirteen years 
grape prices are remaining relatively stable in spite of increased california production as new plantings from recent years have come into production 
in  almond revenues decreased  or  to  sales of current year crop almonds accounted for  of revenues compared to current year crop sales in of  this decrease is primarily due to a delay in the harvest due to weather conditions  which in turn required the ground storage of a significant portion of the harvested almonds 
our almond revenues also include  of revenue from the sale of and prior year crop almonds in  as compared to  of farming revenues attributable to the sale of and prior year crop almonds 
these sales reflect amounts held in inventory at the end of the prior year and sold in the following calendar year 
we are carrying approximately  gross pounds of almonds in our inventory as of december   which we expect will be sold in almond prices have remained relatively constant over the last two years with a trend toward higher prices 
thus far in  the price for almonds has increased steadily due to the stable demand in us and world markets 
the current range of almond prices is to per pound depending on the variety 
as the value of the dollar was relatively weak against foreign currencies during most of  the demand for us almonds remained steady and built on the growth from prior years 
the increased demand for us almonds in is primarily tied to almonds being less expensive for foreign buyers 
strengthening of the us dollar and the slow global economic growth could result in downward pressure on almond prices and decreased demand for the product we are carrying in our year end inventory 
the following table reflects crop revenues in thousands for the last three years by variety of product and crop year 
production of almonds  pistachios and walnuts are stated in thousands of pounds and production of winegrapes is stated in thousands of tons 
average prices are stated on a per pound basis for almonds  and pistachios  and average prices are stated on a per ton basis for winegrapes

current year crop prior year crops price adjustment signing bonus subtotal almonds pistachios lbs 
current year crop price adjustment subtotal pistachios winegrapes tons current year crop price adjustment subtotal winegrapes total crop proceeds other farming revenues total farming revenues all of our crops are sensitive to the size of each year s world crop 
large crops in california and abroad can depress prices 
with current worldwide grape production more in line with worldwide demand  the pressure on prices has been alleviated at the present time and grape prices should remain at current levels 
our long term projection is that crop production  especially of almonds and pistachios will continue to increase on a statewide basis over time because of new plantings  which could negatively impact future prices if the growth in demand does not keep pace with production 
while demand for product has been strong both in the united states and in export markets over the last few years  any significant increase in the dollar along with slow global economic growth could have a negative impact on the markets 
it is too early to project crop yields and what impact that may have on prices later in water delivery and water availability continues to be a long term concern within california 
any limitation of delivery of swp water and the absence of available alternatives during drought periods could potentially cause permanent damage to orchards and vineyards 
while we could be impacted by this  we believe we have sufficient water resources available to meet our requirements in please see our discussion on water in item  properties water operations 
farming segment profits were  in  a decrease of  or  when compared to the prior year 
these comparable farming segment profits resulted from an overall increase in both revenues and expenses 
an increase of  in farm crop revenues was diluted by 
table of contents lower farming lease revenue and associated water sales 
farming expenses increased by  mainly as a result of  of additional fixed water costs as compared to grape revenues for the crop decreased  or  to  as compared to due to decreased production and lack of bonus payments for high sugar content 
sugar content of the grapes is impacted by the weather and timing of the grape harvest 
the higher sugar content of our crop triggered a bonus payment on our rubired varietal and resulted in a higher average price for our winegrape crop when compared to in  grape production decreased approximately tons as compared to as we removed vines in the region of trcc east to make way for additional commercial real estate development 
in  almond revenues increased  or  to  sales of current year crop accounted for  of revenues compared to current year crop sales in of  this increase was achieved through the sale of approximately  more pounds of almonds from the current year crop as compared to our almond revenues include  of revenue from the sale of and prior year crop almonds in as compared to  of farming revenues attributable to the sale of and prior year crop almonds 
these sales reflect amounts held in inventory at the end of the prior year and sold in the following calendar year 
in  pistachio revenues decreased  or  to  pistachio yields increased  pounds in compared to due to being an on production year in the alternate bearing production cycle for pistachios 
this increase in production was substantially less than the expected yield for an on production year  as many of the nut shells did not form fruit 
this resulted in a significant reduction in the pounds of edible nuts available for sale compared to our estimate 
the increase in yield in compared to was partially offset by a price decline from an average of per pound in to per pound in the price decline for pistachios is attributable to the larger worldwide crop

investment income investment income for fell  or  to  due to the timing of new investments and much lower investment and reinvestment rates during as compared to rates on matured investments 
lower investment rates led to an overall decline of basis points in the weighted average return of the investment portfolio 
the above interest income relates to our marketable securities portfolio as further disclosed in footnote  marketable securities  of our financial statements for the year ended december  investment income for of  represented a  or  decrease compared to this decrease in investment income was due to a decrease in average funds invested during compared to impairment losses of  taken during were fully offset by gains recognized on the subsequent sale of the investments 

table of contents interest expense interest expense was  in and  in both and interest incurred and paid during was  compared to  in and  in  of which   and  respectively  were capitalized 
corporate expenses corporate expenses of  in represented a decrease of  when compared to due primarily to the reversal of stock compensation expenses  which was partially offset by increases in bonus expense as well as increases in professional service fees 
additionally  in there were increases in depreciation  professional services  licenses and fees relating to our records and information management system coming online 
corporate expenses decreased during when compared to primarily as a result of a decrease in compensation expenses of  due to decreased executive and employee bonuses and stock compensation 
additional savings were achieved though reduction of discretionary travel  donations and fuel costs 
offsetting this decrease were increases in amortization expense of long term water contracts 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures in  we recognized net earnings of  from unconsolidated joint ventures compared to  of net earnings in our largest contributor to equity in earnings of joint ventures is the ta petro joint venture 
for  this joint venture provided  in earnings 
this is a decline of  when compared to due to higher operating expenses because of a full year of operations at the new ta site and to a full year of interest expense 
a favorable variance for in the ta petro joint venture was the increase in volume and activity at the travel centers as revenues grew due to a full months of operations at the new site and higher diesel sales volumes 
offsetting the decline in earnings at the ta petro joint venture was an improvement in the loss from the five west parcel joint venture due to a full year of lease revenues from a tenant in a portion of the building 
during  our portion of the loss declined to  from  in within our centennial joint venture  our partners are pardee homes  lewis investment co 
llc and standard pacific 
we have stated in past filings that the last few years have been extremely difficult for many homebuilders as they have seen their businesses decline and their internal financing become much more difficult 
we have also noted in our filings that if the real estate sector continued to be impacted by the economy it could become necessary for one or all of our current partners to leave the joint venture due to difficulty in meeting obligations related to future required capital contributions 
due to these circumstances the joint venture agreement was amended in august to allow our partners to become non funding members during the entitlement phase of the project while we continue as the sole funding partner 
during this period any non funding partner s percentage ownership interest will be diluted by a to ratio with regard to the amount of capital contributed on such partner s behalf 
consequently  the operating results of centennial founders were consolidated effective july  despite this change  our partners continue to be involved in an advisory capacity and may re elect contributing status at a later time 
at december  we have a ownership position in centennial founders 
the  square foot building owned by our five west parcel joint venture remained partially leased during in november  the construction loan on the building was repaid as the 
table of contents required coverage ratio had not been achieved 
replacement financing was completed in august the replacement financing is for a maximum loan amount of  the current outstanding loan balance is  this note is due in the available amount on the loan is to be used for tenant improvements 
the replacement financing is fully secured by the building as well as guarantees from each partner 
we do not believe the bank will ever call on the guarantees provided 
during  we recognized net earnings of  from unconsolidated joint ventures compared to net earnings of  during the largest single component of these earnings consisted of our portion of the equity in the earnings of ta petro of  the balance of the net earnings from joint ventures consisted of losses from five west parcel of  and losses from tmv llc of  also included in this amount is our share of the loss from the centennial founders operations for the pre consolidation period january  through june  of  after that date the results of operations of the centennial founders joint venture are consolidated due to amendments to the partnership agreement which qualified the joint venture for consolidation 
earnings from our ta petro joint venture declined  when compared to due to increased operating expenses 
new travel plaza facilities routinely take up to three years to achieve consistent profitability 
losses from the centennial and tmv joint ventures did not vary significantly from those incurred in income taxes for financial statement purposes  our effective tax rate for was after taking into consideration permanent and temporary timing differences 
our effective tax rate is impacted by the noncontrolling interest held in the centennial founders partnership because income loss before income taxes includes losses allocable to the noncontrolling interest 
our tax expense for is  during  our largest permanent tax difference was related to depletion allowances 
we have a tax receivable at december  of  due to net operating loss carry backs 
for  we had net deferred tax assets of  and a related allowance of  our largest deferred tax assets were made up of temporary differences related to the capitalization of costs  pension adjustments  and stock grant expense 
deferred tax liabilities consist of depreciation  deferred gains  cost of sale allocations  and straight line rent 
due to the nature of most of our deferred tax assets  we believe they will be used in future years and an allowance is not necessary 
however  one deferred tax asset related to a charitable donation of land is limited in the available carry forward period and because it is more likely than not that this asset will not be utilized  an allowance has been set up for the full value of the asset 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow and liquidity 
our financial position allows us to pursue our strategies of land entitlement  development  and conservation 
accordingly  we have established well defined priorities for our available cash  including investing in core business segments to achieve profitable future growth 
we have historically funded our operations with cash flows from operating activities  cash and investments  and short term borrowings from our bank credit facilities 
in the past  we have also issued common stock and used the proceeds for funding needs 
to enhance shareholder value  we will continue to make investments in our real estate segments to secure land entitlement approvals  build infrastructure for our developments  ensure adequate future water supplies  and provide funds for general land development activities 
within our farming segment  we will make investments as needed to improve efficiency and add capacity to its operations when it is profitable to do so 

table of contents our cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities totaled approximately  at december   an increase of  from the corresponding amount at the end of cash and marketable securities increased in due to a successful rights offering which generated approximately  in new equity  reimbursement of  in infrastructure costs at trcc east from the east cfd  and an equity distribution from our five west parcel llc joint venture of  this inflow was partially offset by our continuing investments in our real estate projects  investments in our joint ventures  the purchase of water in december  and repayment of our line of credit in june the following table summarizes the cash flow activities for the last three years year ended december in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities operations during provided  in cash  which is an improvement of  or  when compared to the improvement compared to is due to our net income for the year after considering the impact of non cash operating expenses  and a  distribution from the ta petro joint venture 
these improvements were partially offset by increases in current assets that reflect the growth in farming activities during our operations provided  of cash during which reflects a decline of  or  compared to cash provided by operations in the primary reason for the decrease in cash inflows from operations in compared to was our net operating loss of  and a decline in liabilities of  including trade payables  accrued liabilities and income taxes payable 
this cash outflow was mainly offset by non cash operating expenses of  including depreciation  retirement plan costs  abandonments  and stock compensation 
during  we invested  compared to  in our investments during are primarily related to marketable securities  water purchases  our active real estate projects  our farming division  and joint ventures 
we invested  in property and equipment  of which  was invested in real estate projects 
of this amount   was related to the centennial joint venture 
the remaining amount of investment is related to infrastructure and building costs at trcc and equipment and farm development costs 
we also purchased  acre feet of swp water during the year and invested in additional banking water at a total cost of  we continue to believe water is a valuable long term asset for our future needs and we will continue to evaluate and possibly invest in new water sources and water infrastructure in the future 
within our joint ventures we contributed  of capital to tmv and  to the five west parcel and west joint ventures 
our largest investment for the year was tied to the investment of a portion of the rights offering proceeds into short term marketable securities for our use in the near term future 

table of contents investing activities utilized  of funds in compared to  in investments for these years were primarily dominated by investments in our real estate projects  investments in our joint ventures  water purchases and investments in our farming operations 
capital investments of  in include real estate projects of  compared to capital investments in of  which included real estate project investments of  the real estate project investments are primarily related to infrastructure development at trcc and to the capitalization of costs related to our entitlement activities in our real estate projects which  in  included our conservation agreement 
we also invested cash of  in our tmv joint venture   in our five west parcel joint venture  and  in our centennial joint venture and made a non cash contribution of land with a book value of  to the west llc joint venture and a non cash contribution of  to our centennial joint venture 
of the  of cash invested in our centennial joint venture   was invested subsequent to its july  consolidation  therefore the amount presented as investments in joint ventures in our statement of cash flows is shown net of this amount 
we anticipate that our capital investment requirements for could be as high as  these estimated investments include approximately  of infrastructure and entitlement investment for real estate development projects and approximately  of investment within our operating and corporate operations for the replacement of equipment 
in  we expect to contribute approximately  to our various joint ventures  including centennial  and make an additional  investment in water assets 
we continue to add to our current water assets to help secure our ability to supply water to our farming and real estate activities and as a future investment  since we believe that the cost of water in california will continue to increase 
investments in water are expected to continue at varied levels in future years 
financing activities generated net cash of  during the primary source of this increase in cash was the successful rights offering competed in june a portion of these funds were used to payoff the outstanding balance on our working line of credit 
we currently have no outstanding balance on our line of credit 
as discussed above  during the second quarter of we completed a rights offering 
under the terms of the rights offering  we distributed at no charge to the stockholders of the company  one transferable subscription right for each share of tejon common stock owned by such stockholders as of may   the record date 
the rights offering also included an over subscription privilege  which entitled a stockholder who exercised all of its basic subscription rights the right to purchase additional shares of common stock that remained unsubscribed at the end of the rights offering period 
at the completion of the rights offering we issued  shares of stock raising approximately  of new capital 
our funds provided by financing activities of  during resulted from net borrowings of  on our credit line and  from the exercise of stock options 
the funds were utilized as working capital for our operations and for contributions to our joint ventures 
distributions from our joint ventures and proceeds from the sale of securities were used to repay  of the borrowing 
we use this credit facility to fulfill cash needs that are not met by maturing securities or operating inflows due to the timing of those activities 
our funds provided by financing activities of  during resulted from borrowings of  on our line of credit and  of cash received from the exercise of stock options 
it is difficult to accurately predict cash flows due to the nature of our businesses and fluctuating economic conditions 
our earnings and cash flows will be affected from period to period by the commodity nature of our farming operations and the timing of sales and leases of property within 
table of contents our development projects 
the timing of sales and leases within our development projects is difficult to predict due to the time necessary to complete the development process and negotiate sales or lease contracts 
often  the timing aspect of land development can lead to particular years or periods having more or less earnings than comparable periods 
based on our experience  we believe we will have adequate cash flows and cash balances over the next twelve months to fund internal operations 
capital structure and financial condition 
at december   total capitalization was  consisting of  of debt and  of equity and resulting in a debt to total capitalization ratio of less than  which is more than a decline from the prior year s debt to total capitalization ratio 
we have a long term revolving line of credit of  that  as of december   had no outstanding balance 
at the company s option  the interest rate on this line of credit can be fixed at over a selected libor rate or can be fixed at above libor for a fixed rate term 
during the term of this credit facility which matures in october  we can borrow at any time and partially or wholly repay any outstanding borrowings and then re borrow  as necessary 
under the terms of the line of credit  we must maintain tangible net worth  defined as total equity  including noncontrolling interest  plus debt less intangible assets  not less than  and liquid assets of not less than  at december  our tangible net worth was  and liquid assets were  this line of credit is secured by a portion of our farm acreage 
the outstanding long term debt  less current portion of  is  at december  this debt is being used to provide long term financing for a building being leased to starbucks and the debt is secured by the leased building and land 
our current and future capital resource requirements will be provided primarily from current cash and marketable securities  cash flow from ongoing operations  proceeds from the sale of developed and undeveloped parcels  potential sales of assets  sales of easements over our land  additional use of debt  proceeds from the reimbursement of public infrastructure costs through the community facilities district bond debt described below under off balance sheet arrangements  and the issuance of common stock 
as noted above  we have  in cash and securities at december  and current availability on lines of credit to meet any short term liquidity needs 
we continue to expect that substantial future investments will be required in order to develop our land assets 
in order to meet these long term capital requirements  we may need to secure additional debt financing and continue to renew our existing credit facilities 
in addition to debt financing  we will use other capital alternatives such as joint ventures with financial partners  sales of assets  sales of easements  and the issuance of common stock 
there is no assurance that we can obtain financing or that we can obtain financing at favorable terms 
we believe we have adequate capital resources to fund our cash needs and our capital investment requirements as described earlier in the cash flow and liquidity discussions

our operating lease obligations are for office equipment  several vehicles  and a temporary trailer providing office space and average approximately  per month 
our financial obligations to the conservancy are prescribed in the conservation agreement 
our advances to the conservancy are dependent on the occurrence of certain events and their timing  and are therefore subject to change in amount and period 
the amounts included above are the minimum amounts we anticipate contributing through the year the obligation shown above represents eighty percent of the total required obligations under the conservation agreement for the next three years and fifty five percent thereafter 
these percentages take into consideration current and anticipated cash funding levels of the company to the tmv llc and the centennial founders  llc and the anticipated funding levels of our joint venture partners 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have long term liabilities for deferred employee compensation  including pension and supplemental retirement plans 
any payments related to the supplemental executive retirement plan are not included above since they are dependent upon when the employee retires or leaves the company 
in addition  minimum pension funding requirements are not included above  as such amounts are not available for all periods presented

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial or commodity market prices or rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of interest rates and commodity prices 
financial market risks our exposure to financial market risks includes changes to interest rates and credit risks related to marketable securities  interest rates related to our outstanding indebtedness and trade receivables 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields and prudently managing risk 
to achieve this objective and limit interest rate exposure  we limit our investments to securities with a maturity of less than five years and an 
table of contents investment grade rating from moody s or standard and poor s 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  marketable securities 
the company has potential interest rate risk exposure on its line of credit  which as of december  had no outstanding balance 
the company does have some interest rate exposure related to its long term debt currently outstanding 
the line of credit interest rate can be tied to a libor rate on a floating or fixed basis and the rate would change when that rate changes 
the long term debt  as of december  has a fixed interest rate and the fair value of this long term debt will change based on interest rate movements in the market 
the floating rate feature in our line of credit can expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates 
we believe it is prudent at times to limit the variability of floating rate interest payments and in the past have entered into interest rate swaps to manage those fluctuations 
at december   we had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements 
however  ta petro  an unconsolidated joint venture  has an interest rate swap agreement with respect to  of its long term debt to manage interest rate risk by converting floating interest rate debt to fixed rate debt 
this swap agreement matures in august and is a contract to exchange variable rate for fixed rate interest payments periodically over the life of the agreement 
the interest rate swap fixed rate is 
as of december   the company s portion of the decline in fair market value of the interest rate swap was a loss of  market risk related to our inventories ultimately depends on the value of the almonds  winegrapes  and pistachios at the time of payment or sale 
credit risk related to our receivables depends upon the financial condition of our customers 
based on historical experience with current customers and periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions  we believe our credit risk is minimal 
market risk is discussed below in commodity price exposure 
the following tables provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates

table of contents interest rate sensitivity financial market risks principal amount by expected maturity at december  in thousands thereafter total fair value assets marketable securities weighted average interest rate liabilities short term debt weighted average interest rate long term debt weighted average interest rate in comparison to the prior years  our risk with regard to fluctuations in interest rates has decreased related to the use of debt because there is no outstanding balance on our line of credit 
our risk with regard to fluctuations in interest rates has increased slightly related to marketable securities since these balances have increased compared to the prior year 
commodity price exposure we have exposure to adverse price fluctuations associated with certain inventories and accounts receivable 
inventories consist of farming and processing costs related to almond production and crop production 
the farming costs inventoried are recorded as actual costs incurred 
historically  these costs have been recovered each year when that year s crop harvest has been sold 
with respect to accounts receivable  the amount at risk relates primarily to farm crops 
these receivables are often recorded as estimates of the prices that ultimately will be received for the crops
