liquidity and capital resources history and background from february when our ipo occurred through fiscal  inclusive  we have raised a net total of approximately million from the issuance of common and preferred stock  the sale of convertible debt and the exercise of options and warrants for our capital stock 
overtime  lightpath has transformed its business model to accommodate the changes in the optical market 
in  the company began a program to reduce its operating costs  including restructuring its manufacturing operations 
by  the major elements of this program were implemented resulting in a significant reduction of costs 
the elements of the program were moving the majority of our manufacturing to our shanghai facility  converting our tooling to a less expensive ceramic system  and introducing lower cost glass materials 
with this new cost structure we have focused on leveraging our facility in shanghai to address high volume  lower cost applications 
during this period  we enhanced our sales channels by adding distribution coverage in north america and asia  and adding a master distributor in europe 
additionally  we have designed lenses specifically for particular markets 
as we have implemented this new business strategy the fundamentals of the company have been improving each year and as we continue to build the business volume we anticipate that the company will reach profitability in the future 
however  we did not reach a status of positive cash flow or profitability during fiscal or as shown in the accompanying financial statements  the company has incurred recurring losses from operations and as of june  the company has an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
cash provided by used in operations was   and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
the improvements in the cash flows from operations are as a result of the cost reductions we implemented and the additional markets the company is able to address due to its lower cost structure 
in addition  starting in fiscal we redesigned the collimator product line  increased sales prices on gradium products  obtained more favorable material costs by sourcing some purchased components in china  and instituted more efficient management techniques  all of which have improved our product yields 
management believes these factors will contribute towards achieving profitability  assuming we meet our sales targets 
management has developed an operating plan for fiscal and believes the company has adequate financial resources for achievement of that plan and to sustain its current operations in the coming year 
nevertheless  management will be monitoring the plan closely during the year and should the plan objectives not be met during the year  remedial actions will be initiated 
the company had a cash balance of approximately  at june  during fiscal  the company raised approximately million from the sale of common stock and warrants 
the company may still seek external debt or equity financing if it can be obtained in an amount and on terms that are acceptable  however  the company may be required to seek external financing regardless of whether the terms would otherwise be acceptable if the company s financial resources are not sufficient to sustain its operations or to pursue its business plan 
the fiscal operating plan and related financial projections we have developed anticipate sales growth primarily from precision molded optics  with the emphasis on low cost high volume applications  optical assemblies including our redesigned collimator product line and infrared products 
we expect margin improvements based on production efficiencies and reductions in product costs as a result of the shifting of our manufacturing operations to shanghai  and improved overhead absorption as we increase the volume of products produced  which in turn lowers our material costs since we are able to purchase materials in higher volumes 
we also will continue to implement new cost reductions with programs to improve tool life and lower anti reflective coating costs 
we have taken certain actions to conserve our cash including extending payment terms with certain of our suppliers and by delaying purchases for as long as practical using just in time ordering practices 
in march the orlando staff was reduced to a four day work week 
increased sales allowed us to return to a five day work week in november this reduced work week resulted in savings of  in fiscal in wages and benefits 
in fiscal  we redesigned certain product lines collimators and precision molded optics  increased sales prices on gradium products  obtained more favorable material costs by sourcing some purchased components in china  and have instituted more efficient management techniques which have improved our product yields 
we believe these factors will contribute towards achieving profitability assuming we meet our sales targets 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern 
we continue to face financial challenges along with many in the industries we do business with  as the worldwide economic instability continues to create turbulence in the market 
we engaged in continuing efforts to keep costs under control as we sought renewed sales growth 
our efforts were directed toward reaching positive cash flow and profitability 
if these efforts are not successful  we will need to raise additional capital 
should capital not be available to us at reasonable terms  other actions may become necessary in addition to cost control measures and continued efforts to increase sales 
these actions may include exploring strategic options for the sale of the company  the sale of certain product lines  the creation of joint ventures or strategic alliances under which we will pursue business opportunities  the creation of licensing arrangements with respect to our technology  or other alternatives 
on september   the company had a book cash balance of approximately  we execute all foreign sales from our orlando facility and inter company transactions in united states dollars  mitigating the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
assets and liabilities denominated in non united states currencies  primarily the chinese renminbi  are translated at rates of exchange prevailing on the balance sheet date  and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange for the year 
during the years ended june  and we incurred a  gain and a  loss on foreign currency translation  respectively 
cash flows financings on august   we executed a securities purchase agreement with twenty four institutional and private investors with respect to the private placement of senior convertible debentures the debentures 
the debentures are secured by substantially all of our previously unencumbered assets pursuant to a security agreement and are guaranteed by our wholly owned subsidiaries  geltech and lpoi pursuant to a subsidiary guarantee 
the sale of the debentures generated gross proceeds of approximately million and net proceeds of million 
we used the funds to provide working capital for our operations 
among the investors were steven brueck  j 
james gaynor  louis leeburg  robert ripp  gary silverman and james magos  all of whom were directors or officers of lightpath as of august  mr 
magos resigned effective september  the original maturity date of the debentures was august   on which date the outstanding principal amount of the debentures would have been due 
interest of  was due on october  and was prepaid by the company on august  by issuing  shares of common stock in payment of such interest based upon the closing price of per share the october interest shares 
the interest accruing on the debentures from october  to august  was prepaid by issuing common stock in december upon issuance the debentures were immediately convertible into  shares of common stock  based on a conversion price of per share  which was of the closing bid price of our common stock on the nasdaq capital market on july  investors also received warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock the warrants 
the warrants are exercisable for a period of five years beginning on august  with of the warrants  exercisable for  shares  priced at per share and the remaining of the warrants  exercisable for  shares  priced at per share 
investors who participated in our july offering were given an incentive to invest in the debenture offering 
four investors from the july offering participated in the debenture offering and as a result  we reduced the exercise price of the warrants they received in the july offering from per share to per share 
the reduced exercise price lowered potential proceeds on the exercise of the warrants from the july offering by  to  additionally  such investors were issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock the incentive shares  valued at we paid a commission to the exclusive placement agent for the offering  first montauk securities corp 
first montauk  in an amount equal to  plus costs and expenses 
we also issued to first montauk and its designees warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price equal to per share  which was of the closing bid price of the our common stock on the nasdaq capital market on july  the warrants were valued at  using the black scholes merton pricing model and were recorded as debt costs 
the warrants are exercisable for a period of five years beginning on august  in addition  the exercise price of of the warrants previously issued to first montauk and its designees at the closing of the july offering was reduced from to per share 
this reduced warrant exercise price lowered potential proceeds on the exercise of the warrants issued to first montauk from the july offering by  to  the private placement was exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act of  as amended the act  pursuant to section of the act in that we sold the debentures  warrants and shares of common stock in a transaction not involving any public offering and pursuant to rule of regulation d promulgated thereunder 
the shares into which the debentures are convertible  the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants  the october interest shares and the incentive shares have been registered for resale under the act 
the registration was declared effective on october  the warrants and the incentive shares issued to the debenture holders were valued at issuance at  and recorded as a discount on the debt 
the incentive shares were valued using the fair market value of the company s stock on the date of issuance 
the warrants were valued using the black scholes merton valuation model using assumptions similar to those used to value the company s stock options and restricted stock units 
in addition a beneficial conversion feature associated with the debentures was valued at the date of issuance at  and was recorded as a discount on the debt 
the total debt discount of  was amortized using the effective interest method over the original month term of the debentures and subsequently adjusted for the extension of the maturity date of the debentures 
we also incurred debt issuance costs associated with the issuance of the debentures of  which were amortized over the original month term using the effective interest method  adjusted for accelerated conversions of the debentures and the extension of the maturity date of the debentures 
the costs were for broker commissions  legal and accounting fees  filing fees and  representing the fair value of the  warrants shares issued to first montauk 
we used the black scholes merton model to determine fair value of the warrants issued to first montauk 
the warrants carry a five year term  expiring on august   and are immediately exercisable at a per share price of for one third of the warrants and for two thirds of the warrants 
for the year ended june  and   and  respectively of the debt issuance costs were amortized through interest expense on the consolidated statement of operations 
on december  the debentures were amended to allow debenture holders to convert of their debentures into shares of common stock 
as a result   of the debentures were converted into  shares of common stock 
as an inducement to partially convert the debentures  we issued additional warrants valued at  using the black scholes merton method and recorded as interest expense and prepaid the interest of  on the unconverted portion of the debentures through the original maturity date of august   which resulted in the issuance of  shares of common stock 
the interest payment of  for the quarter ended december  resulted in the issuance of  shares of common stock 
as a result of the debenture conversion   of debt discount was written off to interest expense 
on may  we filed a registration statement to register those additional interest shares and the shares underlying the warrants which were issued in december the registration statement was declared effective on june  during the year ended june   the company s debt obligations were reduced by  through the conversions of certain debentures into shares of common stock 
costs associated with the conversion of these debentures were  which reduced the proceeds recognized 
these transactions increased interest expense by  for the year ending june   reflecting debt issue costs  prepaid interest and discount on the debt that were written off as a result of the debt conversions of certain of the debentures into shares of common stock 
during the fiscal year ended june   the company s debt obligations were reduced by  through conversion of certain of the debentures into shares of common stock 
on march  debenture holders holding approximately of the outstanding principal amount of the debentures consented to an amendment to extend the maturity date from august to august the one debenture holder electing not to participate in the extension was paid all amounts due under the debenture held by such holder  or  in april pursuant to the terms of the amendment  interest will be prepaid in common stock annually each august 
the extension of the maturity date of the debentures was determined to be substantial and therefore triggered debt extinguishment accounting under asc  which requires the debentures to be adjusted to fair value 
the debentures are hybrid financial instruments that blend characteristics of both debt and equity securities 
the debentures embody settlement alternatives to the holder providing for either redemption of principal and interest in cash forward component or conversion into the company s common stock embedded conversion feature 
as a result of the debt extinguishment accounting   of the unamortized debt discount and  of the unamortized debt issuance costs were written off to loss on extinguishment of debt 
the calculated fair value of the amended debentures as of march  was  and included  for the forward component and  for the embedded conversion feature 
the forward component was valued using the present value of discounted cash flows arising from the contractual principal and interest payment terms and the embedded conversion feature was valued using a monte carlo simulations method 
the fair value of the amended debentures exceeded the carrying value of the debentures just prior to the amendment date by  recognized as a premium 
approximately of the debentures are held by related parties and as such  of the premium was considered a capital contribution and was not included in the loss on extinguishment and therefore had no impact on additional paid in capital 
the remaining  of the premium was associated with the debentures to non related parties and thus was recorded to loss on extinguishment of debt and additional paid in capital 
for the years ended june  and   and  respectively  of the amortized debt discount was amortized through interest expense on the consolidated statement of operations 
total principal outstanding on the debentures and the gross amount outstanding for directors  officers and stockholders purchases under the debentures was  and  respectively at june  we can force the debenture holders to convert the debentures into shares of our common stock if our stock price exceeds per share 
a forced conversion of the debentures would include a premium on the face amount 
no payment of dividends may be made while the debentures are outstanding 
during fiscal  we completed two private placement offerings with certain institutional and private investors 
on august   we executed a securities purchase agreement with thirty three investors with respect to a private placement of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at per share and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share the august warrants 
the august warrants are exercisable for a period of five years beginning on february  we received aggregate gross cash proceeds from the issuance of the common stock exclusive of proceeds from any future exercise of the august warrants in the amount  we used the funds to provide working capital for our operations 
we paid a commission to the exclusive placement agent for the offering  garden state securities  inc garden state  in an amount equal to  plus costs and expenses 
we also issued to garden state and its designees warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at exercise price equal to per share  for a five year term beginning february  legal and other expenses to register the shares of  were netted against the proceeds 
the private placement is exempt from the registration requirements of the act  pursuant to section of the act in that the shares of common stock and august warrants were sold by the company in a transaction not involving any public offering and pursuant to rule of regulation d promulgated thereunder 
the shares of common stock and the shares of common stock underlying the august warrants have been registered for resale under the act 
the registration statement was declared effective on october  on april   we executed a securities purchase agreement with seven institutional and private investors  with respect to a private placement of an aggregate of  shares of common stock at per share for all non insider purchasers  and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock the april warrants 
the april warrants have an exercise price of per share  are exercisable after october   and have a five year term 
we received aggregate gross cash proceeds from the issuance of the common stock exclusive of proceeds from any future exercise of the april warrants in the amount of  we used the funds to provide working capital for its operations 
among the investors were j 
james gaynor and louis leeburg  both of whom are directors or officers of lightpath  who paid per share of common stock 
we paid a commission to the exclusive placement agent for the offering  garden state  in an amount equal to  plus costs and expenses 
we also issued to garden state and its designees warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at exercise price equal to per share 
the april warrants have a five year term and are exercisable by garden state and its designees after october  the private placement is exempt from the registration requirements of the act  pursuant to section of the act in that the shares of common stock and the april warrants were sold by the company in a transaction not involving any public offering and pursuant to rule of regulation d promulgated thereunder 
the shares of common stock and the shares of common stock underlying the warrants have been registered for resale under the act 
the registration statement was declared effective on may  cash flows operating and investing cash provided during fiscal was approximately  an increase of approximately  from fiscal we anticipate lower glass costs to result from our replacement of internally fabricated material with purchased materials from suppliers in asia and lower coating costs due to larger unit volumes 
these cost reductions are expected to improve our cash flow in future years 
while progress has been made to reduce operating cash outflow since fiscal  significant risk and uncertainty remains 
our cash provided by operations was approximately  for the fourth quarter of fiscal cost cutting measures were implemented in fiscal and but revenues were not high enough to cover fixed costs 
the fiscal operating plan and related financial projections we developed anticipate continued sales growth and continuing margin improvements based on production efficiencies and reductions in product costs  offset by marginal increases in selling  administrative and new product development expenditures 
during fiscal  we expended approximately  for capital equipment in comparison to  during fiscal the majority of the capital expenditures during both fiscal and fiscal were related to equipment used to enhance or expand our production capacity and for tooling for our precision molded products 
our operating plan for fiscal estimates expenditures at increased levels to enhance or expand our capacity  however  we may spend more or less depending on opportunities and circumstances 
results of operations operating results for fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  revenue for fiscal year totaled million compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of 
the increase from the prior fiscal year was primarily attributable to higher sales volumes for precision molded optics  collimators and gradium lenses 
our precision molded optics sales units were significantly higher but our average selling price was lower 
this is the result of our pursuit of the high volume low cost lens business 
growth in sales going forward is expected to be derived primarily from the precision molded optics product line  particularly our low cost lenses being sold in asia and the growth of our infrared lens business 
our gross margin percentage in fiscal compared to fiscal decreased to from 
total manufacturing cost of million was million higher in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
this increase in cost of goods sold resulted from increased costs associated with ramping up production volumes which included tooling and labor costs  competitive price pressures and product mix changes 
we incurred increased labor costs of  for additional staff needed to manage our increased production volume and an increase in the chinese labor rates totaling  higher freight costs of  and a one time expense of  associated with increasing the amount of tooling inventory to support higher production levels 
in addition  the changes in our product mix increased our costs by  the product mix change was due to higher sales of isolators  collimators and gradium lenses which all have a higher material cost 
unit shipment volume in precision molded optics was up in fiscal compared to last year 
direct costs  which include material  labor and services  were of revenue in fiscal  as compared to in the prior year 
our average selling price decreased by while our average cost per unit decreased by 
our plant capacity and overhead structure are sufficient to handle much higher levels of production 
going forward into fiscal  the emphasis will be continued unit cost reductions driven by efficient purchasing and more sourcing in china of raw materials and coating services and improved productivity due to a more experienced workforce at the shanghai facility 
over the course of fiscal  as we focused on new product development  we increased our headcount in orlando from to we continue to produce over of our precision molded optics production in our shanghai facility 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by approximately  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase is due to higher wages and benefits of   higher recruiting fees in fiscal and the occurrence of some one time events in fiscal that resulted in a  net reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal these one time events included receipt of  on our d o insurance as a refund for legal expenses  a litigation settlement and corresponding legal expenses and a  reduction of legal expenses related to the reversal of accruals for litigation 
our operating plan for fiscal projects business levels that will require selling  general and administrative expenses to increase as we support a higher level of sales 
we plan to manage our workforce size to meet profit and cash flow goals 
new product development costs in fiscal increased by approximately  to approximately  this increase was primarily due to an increase in the cost of product development materials and higher labor costs 
our operating plan for fiscal projects that product development spending will increase due to enhanced efforts in the development of the infrared product line 
in fiscal our amortization of intangibles remained at approximately  and is expected to remain at this level for fiscal interest expense was approximately  for fiscal as compared to approximately  for fiscal approximately  of the interest expense for fiscal was attributable to our equipment term loan and our capital equipment lease 
the convertible debentures issued on august  accounted for approximately  and  of interest during fiscal and  respectively 
this represents periodic interest of per annum  amortization and the write off of the related debt issuance costs and debt discount 
included in these totals are related debt discount  debt issue costs and prepaid interest of  for debentures which were converted into common stock during fiscal in fiscal we had  for loss on extinguishment of debt incurred when we extended the maturity date of the debentures during fiscal investment and other income decreased by approximately  to an expense of  in fiscal from an income of approximately  in fiscal  due to foreign currency exchange rate impacts during the year 
net loss for fiscal was approximately million compared with approximately  in fiscal  a decline of approximately million 
this increase in loss in the current year was comprised principally of cost of goods sold increased by  primarily due to the change in product mix and increased labor rates in china and higher freight costs  one time tooling costs of  to increase tooling inventory to support higher production levels  and increased sg a salaries and benefits of  key performance indicators how we operate we have continuing sales of two basic types occasional sales via ad hoc purchase orders of mostly standard product configurations our turns business and the more challenging and potentially more rewarding business of customer product development 
in this latter type of business we work with a customer to help them determine optical specifications and even create certain optical designs for them  including complex multi component designs that we call engineered assemblies 
this is followed by sampling small numbers of the product for the customer s test and evaluation 
thereafter  should the customer conclude that our specification or design is the best solution to their product need  we negotiate and win a contract sometimes called a design win whether of a blanket purchase order type or a supply agreement 
the strategy is to create an annuity revenue stream that makes the best use of our production capacity as compared to the turns business  which is unpredictable and uneven 
a key business objective is to convert as much of our business to the design win and annuity model as is possible 
we have several challenges in doing so maintaining an optical design and new product sampling capability  including a high quality and responsive optical design engineering staff  the fact that as our customers take products of this nature into higher volume  commercial production for example  in the case of molded optics  this may be volumes over one million pieces per year they begin to work seriously to reduce costs which often leads them to turn to larger or overseas producers  even if sacrificing quality  and our small business mass means that we can only offer a moderate amount of total productive capacity before we reach financial constraints imposed by the need to make additional capital expenditures in other words  because of our limited cash resources and cash flow  we may not be able to service every opportunity that presents itself in our markets without arranging for such additional capital expenditures 
despite these challenges to winning more annuity business  we nevertheless believe we can be successful in procuring this business because of our unique capabilities in optical design engineering that we make available on the merchant market  a market that we believe is underserved in this area of service offering 
additionally  we believe that we offer value to some customers as a source of supply in the united states should they be unwilling to commit their entire source of supply of a critical component to foreign merchant production sources 
we also continue to have the proprietary gradium lens glass technology to offer to certain laser markets 
our key indicators usually on a weekly basis  management reviews a number of performance indicators 
some of these indicators are qualitative and others are quantitative 
these indicators change from time to time as the opportunities and challenges in the business change 
they are mostly non financial indicators such as units of shippable output by major product line  production yield rates by major product line and the output and yield data from significant intermediary manufacturing processes that support the production of the finished shippable product 
these indicators can be used to calculate such other related indicators as fully yielded unit production per shift  which varies by the particular product and our state of automation in production of that product at any given time 
higher unit production per shift means lower unit cost and therefore improved margins or improved ability to compete where desirable for price sensitive customer applications 
the data from these reports is used to determine tactical operating actions and changes 
we believe that our non financial production indicators  such as those noted  are proprietary information 
the discussions of our results as presented in this annual report include use of the non gaap terms ebitda and gross margin 
gross margin is determined by deducting the cost of sales from operating revenue 
cost of sales includes manufacturing direct and indirect labor  materials  services  fixed costs for rent  utilities and depreciation  and variable overhead 
gross margin should not be considered an alternative to operating income or net income  which are determined in accordance with gaap 
we believe that gross margin  although a non gaap financial measure is useful and meaningful to investors as a basis for making investment decisions 
it provides investors with information that demonstrates our cost structure and provides funds for our total costs and expenses 
we use gross margin in measuring the performance of our business and have historically analyzed and reported gross margin information publicly 
other companies may calculate gross margin in a different manner 
financial indicators that are usually reviewed at the same time include the major elements of the micro level business cycle sales backlog  ebitda  inventory levels  and accounts receivable levels and quality 
these indicators are similarly used to determine tactical operating actions and changes and are discussed in more detail below 
sales backlog sales growth has been and continues to be our best indicator of success 
our best view into the efficacy of our sales efforts is in our order book 
our order book equates to sales backlog 
it has a quantitative and a qualitative aspect quantitatively  our backlog s prospective dollar value and qualitatively  what percent of the backlog is scheduled by the customer for date certain delivery 
we define our disclosure backlog as that which is requested by the customer for delivery within one year and which is reasonably likely to remain in the backlog and be converted into revenues 
this includes customer purchase orders and may include amounts under supply contracts if they meet the aforementioned criteria 
generally  higher backlog is better for us 
disclosure backlog  as defined above  has been as follows in the immediately preceding eight fiscal quarters fiscal quarter ended approximate disclosure backlog q q q q q q q q our disclosure backlog at june  was approximately million 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we debooked orders to two large customers  one due to non payment and one due to customer cancellation 
we believe our backlog will grow as a result of our efforts to enter high volume lower cost commercial markets  including the industrial laser tool market and other imaging related product markets 
we have seen increased quote activity for our black diamond product line and our new blue lenses 
with the continuing diversification of our backlog we expect to show increases in revenue starting in fiscal we have experienced an increase in bookings for our industrial low cost lenses in asia 
we project continued production and shipment growth for these low cost lenses in asia 
ebitda ebitda is a non gaap financial measure used by management  lenders and certain investors as a supplemental measure in the evaluation of some aspects of a corporation financial position and core operating performance 
investors sometimes use ebitda as it allows for some level of comparability of profitability trends between those businesses differing as to capital structure and capital intensity by removing the impacts of depreciation and amortization 
ebitda also does not include changes in major working capital items such as receivables  inventory and payables  which can also indicate a significant need for  or source of  cash 
since decisions regarding capital investment and financing and changes in working capital components can have a significant impact on cash flow  ebitda is not a good indicator of a business cash flows 
we use ebitda for evaluating the relative underlying performance of the company core operations and for planning purposes 
we calculate ebitda by adjusting net loss to exclude net interest expense  income tax expense or benefit  depreciation and amortization  thus the term earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and the acronym ebitda 
our ebitda as defined above  has been as follows in the immediately preceding eight fiscal quarters fiscal quarter ended ebitda q q q q q q q q inventory levels we manage inventory levels to minimize investment in working capital but still have the flexibility to meet customer demand to a reasonable degree 
we review our inventory for obsolete items quarterly 
while the mix of inventory is an important factor  including adequate safety stocks of long lead time materials  an important aggregate measure of inventory in all phases of production is the quarter s ending inventory expressed as a number of days worth of the quarter s cost of sales  also known as days cost of sales in inventory  or dcsi 
it is calculated by dividing the quarter s ending inventory by the quarter s cost of goods sold  multiplied by and divided by generally  a lower dcsi measure equates to a lesser investment in inventory and therefore more efficient use of capital 
the table below shows our dcsi for the immediately preceding eight fiscal quarters fiscal quarter ended dcsi days q q q q fiscal average q q q q fiscal average in comparison  our days cost of sales in inventory for the year ended june  was  compared to for the year ended june  we believe this upward trend in dcsi was principally caused by our decision to run the production schedule to meet the sales forecast 
we increased our inventory in order to meet our sales forecast 
however  our sales did not reach forecasted levels 
accounts receivable levels and quality similarly  we manage accounts receivable levels to minimize investment in working capital 
we escalate our collection efforts when invoices are fifteen days past the due date 
weekly we also review all receivables that are sixty days past terms 
these past due accounts are contacted and all future shipments to them are placed on hold 
we measure the quality of receivables by the proportions of the total that are at various increments past due from our normally extended terms  which are generally days 
the most important aggregate measure of accounts receivable is the quarter s ending balance of net accounts receivable expressed as a number of days worth of the quarter s net revenues  also known as days sales outstanding  or dso 
it is calculated by dividing the quarter s ending net accounts receivable by the quarter s net revenues  multiplied by and divided by generally  a lower dso measure equates to a lesser investment in accounts receivable and therefore more efficient use of capital 
the table below shows our dso for the immediately preceding eight fiscal quarters fiscal quarter ended dso days q q q q fiscal average q q q q fiscal average our days sales outstanding for the year ended june  was compared to at june  we plan to monitor our collections efforts to keep this key indicator as low as reasonably possible 
we strive to have dso no higher than critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting periods presented 
our significant estimates include the allowance for trade receivables which is made up of reserves for bad debts  inventory reserves for obsolesense  revenue recognition  valuation of compensation expense on stock based awards and beneficial conversion and warrant valuation related to convertible debentures 
although we believe that these estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from those estimates given a change in conditions or assumptions that have been consistently applied 
management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with our board of directors  and the board of directors has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form k 
the critical accounting policies used by management and the methodology for its estimates and assumptions are as follows allowance for accounts receivable  is calculated by taking of the total of invoices that are over days past due from the due date and of the total of invoices that are over days past due from the due date 
accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms 
the company performs continuing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition 
recovery of bad debt amounts previously written off is recorded as a reduction of bad debt expense in the period the payment is collected 
if the company s actual collection experience changes  revisions to its allowance may be required 
after all attempts to collect a receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance 
inventories  which consist principally of raw materials  work in process and finished lenses  isolators  collimators and assemblies are stated at the lower of cost or market  on a first in  first out basis 
inventory costs include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
acquisition of goods from our vendors has a purchase burden added to cover customs  shipping and handling costs 
fixed costs related to excess manufacturing capacity have been expensed 
we look at the following criteria for parts to consider for the inventory reserve items that have not been sold in two years or that have not been purchased in two years or of which we have more than a two year supply 
these items as identified are reserved at  as well as reserving for other items deemed to be slow moving within the last twelve months and reserving for items deemed to have low material usage within the last six months 
the parts identified are adjusted for recent order and quote activity to determine the final inventory reserve 
property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets ranging from one to ten years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the related assets using the straight line method 
long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  tooling and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset

asc defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
asc also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
the standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are either directly or indirectly observable 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing 
fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of june  the company uses the market approach to measure fair value for its level financial assets and liabilities  which include cash equivalents of  at june  the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets and liabilities 
the respective carrying value of certain on balance sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values
