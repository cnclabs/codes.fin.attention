item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and business strategy theragenics corporation  a delaware corporation formed in  is a medical device company serving the surgical products and cancer treatment markets  operating in two business segments 
the terms company  we  us  or our mean theragenics corporation and all entities included in our consolidated financial statements 
our surgical products business manufactures  markets and sells disposable devices primarily utilized in certain surgical procedures 
our brachytherapy seed business manufactures  markets and sells radioactive seeds primarily utilized in the treatment of early stage prostate cancer 
at the present time  both of our segments do business primarily in the united states 
our surgical products business is the faster growing of our businesses and has been supported by the cash flows generated by our market leading brachytherapy seed business and our flagship theraseed brand 
in our surgical products business we plan to grow and diversify revenues by adding product offerings and manufacturing capabilit ies  expanding the applications and markets in which we compete  and gaining scale to improve profitability 
our surgical products business was built through the acquisitions of cp medical corp 
in may  galt medical corporation in august  and needletech products  inc in july we currently manufacture almost  products in this business as part of three broad product platforms  wound closure  vascular access and specialty needles 
to date we have maintained the names and brands under which each of these companies previously manufactured  marketed and sold their products 
we serve a number of markets and applications  including  among other areas  interventional cardiology  interventional radiology  vascular surgery  orthopedics  plastic surgery  dental surgery  urology  veterinary medicine sutures  pain management  endoscopy  and spinal surgery 
with the exception of veterinary sutures  ou r surgical products hold relatively small market shares 
our products include both finished goods and components 
our products are sold primarily to original equipment manufacturers oems and to a network of distributors 
our surgical products business has achieved revenue growth in both and growth in is pro forma  assuming we had acquired needletech at the beginning of 
we have accomplished this primarily by increasing sales to existing customers and  to a lesser extent  adding new customers 
further  we achieved this revenue growth during a period of severe economic difficulties 
our strategy for increasing sales and scale going forward includes becoming more integral within the supply chain of our customers both for existing products and for our customers development programs which may allow us to increase sales to existing and new customers from all product platforms  developing new produc ts internally  acquiring products  licenses  and other intellectual property  acquiring businesses and  entering certain markets outside the united states 
we have operated our brachytherapy seed business since  emerging from the development stage in historically our brachytherapy seed segment has generated strong cash flows  which have enabled us to diversify our business substantially 
positive cash flows from our brachytherapy seed business continue despite an industry wide decline in brachytherapy procedures in the united states which began about five years ago 
the overall brachytherapy industry in the united states is now experiencing difficulties primarily due to competition from other treatments 
many of these competing treatments enjoy favorable medicare reimbursement rates relative to brachytherapy reimbursement rates 
we believe this results in a non level playing field for medical device manufacturers and patients 
one of the primary competitive treatments provided by our radiation oncologist customers is intensity modulated radiation therapy  or imrt 
imrt enjoys substantially higher reimbursement rates than brachytherapy  yet clinical studies do not indicate that imrt delivers improved outcomes 
we believe the market positioning and heavy promotion of robotic surgery for prostate cancer treatment has also adversely affected the number of brachytherapy procedures performed 
despite these industry wide difficulties we have maintained positive cash flows in our brachytherapy business for a variety of reasons including  among other things  the relatively fixed nature of our brachytherapy seed manufacturing costs  our ability to anticipate changes in market conditions  our ability to respond to government controlled pricing policies surrounding reimbursement of our products and  more recently  increasing our overall market share 
after consecutive quarters of year over year declines  product revenue in our brachytherapy seed segment excluding license fees increased in both third and fourth quarters of over the periods 
indeed  our product sales increased in the second half of over this success in increasing year over year product revenue was primarily due to obtaining new supply agreements with new distributors in  which increased our market share 
one of these new supply agreements was with core oncology 
see brachytherapy seed business below for additional information on the supply agreement with core 
at the present time we believe that we have additional opportunities to increase our market share through additional distribution agreements  diversification of our product and service offerings  and potential opportunities in markets outside of the united states 
we believe we have these opportunities to expand and broaden our distribution channels because of  among other things  the reliability of our supply  the quality of our products  the quality of our direct sales force  and our long term commitment to the brachytherapy industry including patient education  direct to consumer advertising  and congressional lobbying for fair reimbursement 
ii results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue following is a summary of revenue by segment for each of the three years in the period ended december  in thousands revenue by segment year ended december  surgical products product sales license and fee income total surgical products brachytherapy seed product sales licensing fees total brachytherapy seed intersegment eliminations consolidated surgical products segment revenue in our surgical products business increased in over all three of our general product categories  including wound closure  vascular access  and specialty needles  recorded organic growth during the majority of our revenue growth was driven by our vascular access and wound closure products 
our organic revenue growth was primarily a result of increased sales to existing customers 
open orders in our surgical products segment were million at december  compared to million at december  open orders represent orders from customers for future delivery that we believe to be firm 
open orders are not guaranteed shipments  and they are subject to cancellation or delay 
backlog in our surgical products business was  at december  and  at december  backlog represents orders included in open orders  but for which we have missed promised shipment dates 
during the first quarter of  we experienced a spike in demand and changes in customer purchasing behavior 
these factors increased our backlog early in this increase in our backlog added to an already high level of open orders including backlog that we had entering into the year 
in an attempt to compensate for the additional lead time we were experiencing in shipping orders  some customers added to existing orders 
we incurred overtime  hired temporary labor  and added shifts  among other actions  to help relieve our backlog and address opportunities during the first quarter 
we have since reduced our backlog 
however  we continued to experience changes in customer purchasing behavior 
these circumstances may continue until customer behavior becomes more p redictable and consistent 
a portion of the increase in product sales experienced in resulted from reducing our backlog 
a significant portion of the products in our surgical business continue to be sold to oems and a network of distributors 
ordering patterns of these customers vary and are difficult to predict 
accordingly  surgical products revenue is subject to fluctuation  especially on a quarter to quarter basis 
in addition  revenue has been and will continue to be affected by our customers response to efforts by hospitals to reduce inventories and conserve cash due to the difficult economic climate and macroeconomic uncertainties 
all of these factors may cause the fluctuations in our results to be even more volatile from period to period 
both our surgical products segment and our brachytherapy seed segment sell to core oncology core 
as discussed below under brachytherapy seed segment  we terminated our distribution agreement with core for brachytherapy seeds in february sales to core were less than of revenue in our surgical products segment in ii brachytherapy seed segment we sell our brachytherapy seed products directly to healthcare providers and to third party distributors 
during  we added two new third party distributors 
in january we announced a new distribution agreement with core  and in july we announced a new distribution agreement with oncura  a unit of ge healthcare 
we also sell our i seed i device  and other brachytherapy related products  directly to healthcare providers 
we believe that the industry wide decline in prostate brachytherapy procedure volume in the united states experienced over the last few years continued during some newer forms of competing treatment have increased their market share  especially those with medicare reimbursement levels that are higher than reimbursement levels for brachythera py 
these newer forms of competing treatments include imrt and robotic surgery 
in addition to treatment options that enjoy favorable reimbursement rates and that reduce demand for brachytherapy procedures  we believe brachytherapy seed volume and revenue are also affected by pricing strategies from other brachytherapy providers and uncertainties surrounding reimbursement 
our brachytherapy product sales decreased in from our strategy of increasing market share through new distribution agreements helped to offset the continued year over year industry wide decline in procedures 
this reduced the decline in product sales we would have otherwise experienced in indeed  our product sales increased in the second half of compared to the second half of we have non exclusive distribution agreements in place for the distribution of the theraseed device 
under our third party distribution agreements  we are the exclusive palladium seed supplier for the treatment of prostate cancer for each distributor  and each distributor has the non exclusive right to sell theraseed in the us and canada 
certain agreements also provide distributors with the right to distribute theraseed for the treatment of solid localized tumors other than in the prostate  and with rights to distribute to certain locations outside of north america 
such applications non prostate and outside of north america have not been material and are not expected to become material in the near future 
our principal non exclusive distribution agreement is with cr bard bard 
our agreement with bard provides for automatic one year extensions of the term  unless either party gives notice of its intent not to renew at least twelve months prior to the end of the current term 
the current term expires december  and will be automatically extended for one additional year unless either party gives notice of its intent not to extend by december  sales to bard by our brachytherapy segment represented and of brachytherapy seed segment revenue in and  respectively 
our surgical products segment also sells to bard 
total consolidated sales to bard  including sales in our brachytherapy seed segment and our surgical products segment  represented and of consoli dated revenue in and  respectively 
core became an additional non exclusive distributor of theraseed in january sales to core represented approximately of brachytherapy segment revenue in our surgical products segment also sells to core 
total consolidated sales to core  including sales in our brachytherapy seed segment and our surgical products segment  represented of consolidated product revenue in 
in february  we terminated our agreement with core due to core s failure to pay its trade receivables in accordance with the contractual terms of the agreement 
core had been attempting to become current with amounts due to us 
however  litigation filed against core by a third party in late january created what we view as an unacceptable level of uncertainty surrounding core s ability to satisfy their financial obligations to us for both current and ongoing sales 
in the past  healthcare providers have shown strong loyalty to theraseed and we have been highly successful in retaining theraseed customers following the termination of distribution agreements 
healthcare providers who previously purchased theraseed through core have the opportunity to continue an uninterrupted supply of our product for their patients  either directly from us or through our othe r distribution channels 
to ensure that scheduled patient procedures proceeded as planned  our termination notice provided a transition period during which additional orders from core have been accepted and honored  including orders from core on a prepaid basis 
should core ultimately satisfy its obligations to us and demonstrate an ability to satisfy its obligations going forward  we would consider reentering into a distribution agreement with core 
as of february   we have not experienced a material decline in unit volumes compared to the volumes we would have expected had the core agreement not been terminated by us 
however  it is difficult to predict how much unit volume we will ultimately be able to retain due to  among other things  uncertainties in the marketplace  a continuing decline in overall industry wide procedures and competition 
unless core demons trates an ability to pay  certain shipments made to core in immediately prior to our notice of termination of the agreement and during the notice period may not meet the revenue recognition criteria of us gaap  which could affect our first quarter revenue 
we also currently have non exclusive distribution agreements for theraseed in place with oncura a unit of ge healthcare and brachysciences 
sales under each of these agreements were less than of our brachytherapy product sales in we may pursue additional distribution agreements for both palladium and iodine products in an effort to increase market share 
we may also have opportunities to enter certain markets outside of the united states with an iodine device 
ii we believe that medicare reimbursement policies  which have negatively affected the brachytherapy market in prior periods  will continue 
prior to  medicare continued to reimburse for brachytherapy seeds under the charges adjusted to costs methodology  which is based on the actual invoiced cost of the seeds and which we sometimes refer to as a pass through methodology 
consistent with proposals that the centers for medicare medicaid services cms attempted unsuccessfully to implement in recent years  cms published a final hospital outpatient prospective payment system opps on november  under this fixed opps  which went into effect on january   the per seed rate at which medicare reimburses hospitals for the purc hase of seeds is fixed annually 
we sometimes refer to this system as fixed reimbursement 
we expect to continue to support efforts to urge congress and cms to replace this fixed reimbursement rule by obtaining a new extension of the pass through reimbursement policies which existed prior to fixed reimbursement policies at cms can be expected to lead to pricing pressure from hospitals and other healthcare providers  and to have an adverse effect on our brachytherapy revenue 
the extent of the effect is impossible for us to predict  especially when fixed reimbursement policies are being introduced at a time that coincides with an industry wide decline in procedures being performed and  as a result  a decline in demand for brachytherapy products which is attributable  at least in part  due to favorable cms reimbursement rates enjoyed by alternative  less proven  technologies for early stage prostate cancer treatmen t and uncertainties regarding the implementation and impact of healthcare reform generally 
these factors could have an adverse effect on brachytherapy revenue 
license fees in our brachytherapy segment increased  or  in over license fees include fees from the licensing of our therasphere product  a medical device used for the treatment of liver cancer 
licensing fees also includes fees related to the licensing of certain intellectual property related to an expandable brachytherapy delivery system that we developed 
this agreement  which was executed in may  provides for a minimal non refundable initial license fee and non refundable continuing royalties based upon sales subject to certain minimums 
operating income loss and costs and expenses following is a summary of operating income loss by segment for each of the three years in the period ended december  in thousands year ended december  surgical products operating income loss impairment of goodwill and tradenames surgical products excluding impairment brachytherapy seed operating income impairment of goodwill and tradenames change in estimated value of asset held for sale brachytherapy seed excluding impairment intersegment eliminations operating income loss consolidated excluding impairment operating income excluding impairment is a non gaap financial measure 
in addition to calculations measuring operating income loss as calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  we sometimes utilize operating income excluding certain items  such as impairment  to make operational decisions  evaluate performance  prepare internal forecasts and allocate resources 
operating income excluding impairment is a non gaap financial measure which  when compared with operating income loss calculated in accordance with gaap  allows us to more accurately determine whether a given increase or decrease in operations for a given segment is a result of an event that is non recurring in nature or is reflective of an ongoing performan ce issue 
we believe presentation of this non gaap financial measure provides supplemental information that is helpful to an understanding of the operating results of our businesses and period to period comparisons of performance 
however  we recognize that the use of non gaap measures has limitations  including the fact that they may not be directly comparable with similar non gaap financial measures used by other companies 
we compensate for these limitations by providing full disclosure of each non gaap financial measure and providing a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 
all non gaap financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable gaap disclosures and should not be considered in isolation from  or as a substitute for  financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 
ii surgical products segment operating income in our surgical products segment decreased to  in from million in affecting profitability in the periods was a decline in our gross profit margins on product sales 
our gross profit margins were approximately in compared to in this decline was driven by several factors spikes in demand early in  continuing changes in customer behavior  pricing pressures  changes in product mix and distribution channels  and the move to our new specialty needle manufacturing facility 
we experienced a spike in demand during the first quarter of  increasing our backlog and putting pressure on certain facilities that were already at or near capacity 
to address the spike in demand and backorders  we ran overtime  brought in temporary labor and implemented a third shift at one plant  among other things 
these additional costs eroded our gross margins 
amplifying the costs associated with these actions were changes in customer behavior 
recurring changes in order quantities and requested delivery dates of orders reduced the ability of our operations to efficiently address production requirements 
our former specialty needle manufacturing plant was running at near capacity  putting a strain on operations 
we have also seen an increase in our oem sales relative to our dealer sales during oem sales generally carry a lower gross profit margin 
additionally  we experienced pricing pressure from customers and from the need to respond to aggressive pricing behavior of competitors 
we were able to reduce the backlog experienced early in and reduce or eliminate some of the additional costs we were incurring to address the circumstances that existed during that time 
we also implemented certain measures to better control costs and margins on an ongoing basis 
however  we continue to experience changes in customer behavior  ordering and pricing pressures which in turn  cause variability in our gross margins from period to period 
we believe these factors are at least in part being driven by the continued macroeconomic uncertainties prevalent in the us economy 
we expect continued pressure on our gross margins due to these and other factors at least until customer behavior becomes more predictable and consistent 
also affecting our gross margins was the move to our new specialty needle facility in july we experienced inefficiencies  such as planned downtime  to facilitate the move 
our new facility  which is larger than our previous operating facilities  also has higher operating costs associated with it 
another factor reducing income in the periods was legal fees of  associated with our initiation of legal action against the former owner of cp medical 
this legal action was intended to enforce certain non compete agreements and to protect the trade secrets and other assets of that business  which we acquired in we had no such legal fees in the action was settled in october  and no further significant legal fees are expected to be incurred in this matter 
moving related expenses of  were incurred in in connection with the move to our new  larger specialty needle manufacturing facility 
these expenses are included in selling  general and administrative expenses and in loss on disposal of assets in our statement of earnings 
we completed the move to the new facility in the third quarter of  and no further significant moving related expenses are expected to be incurred 
bad debt expense also increased in  primarily a result of amounts due from core for which we believe collection is doubtful of approximately  both our surgical products segment and our brachytherapy seed segment sell to core 
the circumstances surrounding our relationship with core are discussed above under revenue  brachytherapy seed segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses  other than the aforementioned legal  moving and bad debt expenses  were of revenue in compared to in research and development r d expenses decreased  or  in from our r d program is intended to focus on product extensions  next generation products  and new products that are complementary to our current product lines and that support our customers product lines 
our r d program is directed toward k products and not on products that require lengthy and expensive clinical trials 
we have recently been reassessing the projects in our r d program in an effort to focus on opportunities with a more immediate impact and to consolidate our r d efforts 
we believe that opportunities to support programs for our customers may be more attractive for us than developing new products 
looking forward  our results are expected to be affected by the timing of these investments 
during  we have continued development of a corporate wide enterprise resource planning erp system 
as our erp system was under development  we capitalized certain internal costs associated with its development 
these costs  which consisted primarily of employee payroll and related expenses  totaled  and  in and  respectively  in our surgical products segment 
upon completion of the erp system development at each location  these development costs will no longer be capitalized but will be charged as operating expenses 
we expect to complete the system development at the remaining two locations in the next year 
ii looking forward  we expect a number of items to continue to affect the profitability in our surgical products business including  among other things ordering patterns of our larger oem and distributor customers  costs incurred to address significant changes in demand  continued investments in infrastructure and r d as we make investments to support anticipated future growth and to develop products to address growth opportunities  changes in product mix and sales channels  with sales through oem channels generally carrying a relatively lower gross profit margin and sales through distributor channels generally carrying a somewhat higher gross profit margin  continued pricing pressure from customers  higher maintenance and operating costs associated with our new and larger specialty needle manufacturing facility  the implementation of our new  corporate wide erp system  and the increasing scale of our surgical products business 
brachytherapy seed segment operating income in our brachytherapy business decreased to million in from million in manufacturing related expenses in our brachytherapy business tend to be relatively fixed in nature 
accordingly  even modest changes in revenue can have a significant impact on operating income 
the decline in product sales had a negative effect on operating income in operating income in our brachytherapy seed business is expected to continue to be highly dependent on sales levels due to this high fixed cost component 
increases in our license and fee income contribute to profitability as there are minimal costs associated with those licensing agreements 
the increase in license and fee income in partially offset the declines in product sales 
 we were able to decrease some operating expenses during including personnel related costs  advertising and professional fees 
looking forward  we may not be able to continue to reduce our operating costs 
our brachytherapy business also absorbed fewer corporate overhead costs since we allocate corporate costs based upon the relative revenue of our business segments 
corporate overhead costs allocated to our brachytherapy business declined  in from partially offsetting reductions in operating expenses noted in the preceding paragraph was million of bad debt expense related to amounts due from core for which we believe collection is doubtful 
we terminated our distribution agreement with core in february as discussed above under revenue  brachytherapy seed segment 
we used our judgment in determining the amount due from core for which collection is doubtful 
in making this determination  our estimates and judgment included all facts and circumstances which existed at december  and developments occuring through february  the date we filed this annual report on form k 
we continue to pursue collection of all amounts due to us from core 
if core demonstrates an ability to pay any or all of the amounts previously considered doubtful  this would represent a change in our estimate 
any resul ting change in estimate would in turn reduce our operating expenses in the period in which core demonstrates an ability to pay any or all of the amounts due to us 
in addition  we sold product to core in january  prior to our termination of our agreement with core 
unless core demonstrates an ability to pay  we will have additional charges related to core receivables in the first quarter of non operating income expense a summary of our interest expense is as follows year ended december  interest paid or accrued  including loan fees fair value adjustment interest capitalized total interest expense interest expense paid or accrued  including loan fees  is related to our effective interest rates and the level of our outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
fair value adjustments are related to our interest rate swaps 
such fair value adjustments are unrealized losses and reflect the period to period changes in the estimated fair value of our swaps 
interest capitalized primarily relates to the construction of our new specialty needle manufacturing facility 
interest capitalized is expected to decline in as construction on that facility was completed in our weighted average effective rate was at december  ii we manage our interest rate risk using interest rate swaps associated with outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement  as our interest rates are floating rates based on libor 
we do not hold or issue interest rate swaps for trading purposes  and we hold no other derivative financial instruments other than interest rate swaps 
we enter into interest rate swaps that are designed to hedge the interest rate risk but are not designated as hedging instruments  as defined under guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb 
changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized as interest expense 
such changes in fair value are based on  among other things  discounted cash flows based upon current market expectations about future amounts  yield c urves  and mid market pricing 
accordingly  the fair value of our interest rate swaps is subject to fluctuation and may have a significant effect on our results of operations in future periods 
additionally  the counterparty to our interest rate swaps is the lender under our credit agreement 
accordingly  we are exposed to counterparty credit risk from this financial institution 
we entered into interest rate swaps based on the relationship with this financial institution as our lender and on its credit rating and the rating of its parent company 
we continue to monitor our counterparty credit risk 
other income in includes  received in the settlement of the lawsuit with the former owner of cp medical 
interest income was not material in or income tax expense our effective income tax rate  which includes federal and state income taxes  was approximately in and in  our tax rate was reduced by approximately  of state investment tax credits and r d tax credits 
a significant portion of these credits in related to the construction of our new needle manufacturing facility  and we expect our tax credits to be substantially lower in and beyond 
looking forward  these and other circumstances may continue to cause fluctuations in our effective income tax rate for financial reporting purposes 
future tax rates can be affected by  among other things  tax expense for items unrelated to actual taxable income such as the write off of deferred tax assets associated with share based compensation  changes in tax regulat ions  changes in statutory tax rates  changes in the tax jurisdictions in which we must file income tax returns  and many other items that affect the taxability and deductibility of our revenue and expenses and for which we cannot currently predict 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue surgical products segment revenue in our surgical products business increased in over  primarily as a result of our needletech acquisition 
on a pro forma basis  as if the needletech acquisition had occurred on january   revenue in our surgical products segment would have increased in over all three of our general product categories  including wound closure  introducers and guidewires  and specialty needles  recorded organic growth during our wound closure products performed particularly well  as we believe we provided exceptional value in that application 
a significant portion of the revenues in our surgical business is generated by sales to oems and a network of distributors 
ordering patterns of these customers vary and are difficult to predict 
 accordingly  surgical products revenue is subject to fluctuation  especially on a quarter to quarter basis 
in addition  the volatility and disruptions in the us and global economies and credit markets  and other uncertainties due to the economic slowdown have had an effect on our surgical product revenue 
as general economic conditions worsened in the fourth quarter of  scheduled shipping dates for our open orders during the fourth quarter were farther out than we historically experienced 
we did not experience a similar delay in requested shipping dates at the end of brachytherapy seed segment brachytherapy product sales decreased in from we believe that the industry wide decline in prostate brachytherapy procedure volume experienced in continued in some newer forms of competing treatments have increased their market share  especially those with medicare reimbursement levels that are higher than reimbursement levels for brachytherapy 
these newer forms of competing treatments include imrt and robotic surgery 
our revenues also continued to be affected by the performance of our main distributor 
sales to this distributor declined from to we also maintain our own internal brachytherapy sales force that sells theraseed and i seed directly to hospita ls and physicians 
our direct sales declined in from to revenue from direct sales was of total brachytherapy segment product revenue in compared to in in addition to competition from treatment options that enjoy favorable reimbursement rates  we believe brachytherapy seed revenue is affected by disruptive pricing from other brachytherapy providers and uncertainties surrounding reimbursement as discussed below 
the average selling price of the theraseed device sold directly to hospitals and physicians during was comparable to the period 
ii license fees increased from  in to million in  and include fees from the licensing of our therasphere product  a medical device used for the treatment of liver cancer 
licensing fees also includes fees related to the licensing of certain intellectual property related to an expandable brachytherapy delivery system that we developed 
this agreement  which was executed in may  provides for a minimal non refundable initial license fee and non refundable continuing royalties based upon sales subject to certain minimums 
operating income loss and costs and expenses surgical products segment operating income excluding special items in our surgical products segment was million in compared to million in operating income in our surgical products segment included the results of needletech subsequent to our acquisition on july  accordingly  needletech was included in our consolidated results for all of but only for five months in our gross profit margin on products sales was in compared with in a number of factors affected the comparability between the and periods 
in  our gross profit and operating income was reduced by  of non cash charges related to the acquisition of needletech 
these non cash charges were related primarily to the fair value adjustments to needletech inventory at acquisition and did not recur in excluding these non cash acquisition related charges  our gross profit margin on product sales was in items affecting our gross profit margins in included  among other things  our product and sales channel mix changed subsequent to the needletech acquisition  with a larger proportion of sales being made to oem customers which genera lly carry lower gross profit margins relative to our other channels  continued investments in infrastructure to address expected future growth  and pricing pressures from our customers in  which we believe were at least in part caused by the general macroeconomic uncertainties 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in our surgical products segment was of revenue in compared with in the decline in sg a as a percentage of revenue is due to the increasing scale of our surgical products segment  partially offset by the change in method of allocating our corporate costs 
we now allocate corporate costs based on the relative revenue of each of our two business segments 
because our surgical products segment comprised more of our consolidated revenue in the periods  primarily due to the inclusion of needletech in our consolidated results  corporate costs allocated to our surgical products segment increased by million in from amortization of purchased intangibles increased by million in from this is primarily due to the inclusion of amortization related to needletech purchased intangibles for a full year in we also recorded amortization expense related to our tradenames intangible assets totaling  in we did not record any tradename amortization in amortization of our tradenames intangible assets resulted from our reassessment of their useful lives during our impairment testing at december  operating income in our surgical products business in was also affected by increased investments in our research and development r d program 
r d expenses increased  in from our r d program was launched in the second half of during we began developing a new  corporate wide enterprise resource planning erp information technology system 
as our erp system was under development during  we capitalized certain internal costs associated with its development  totaling  in our surgical products segment 
these internal costs consisted primarily of employee payroll and related expenses 
upon completion of the erp system development at each location  these development costs will no longer be capitalized but will be charged as operating expenses 
sale of asset held for sale in we completed the sale of our oak ridge facility in july this facility was previously classified as a long term asset held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet 
as part of this transaction  the facility was sold and the underlying land sublease was terminated 
the significant portion of the present value of the future payments due under that sublease was previously classified as a long term contract termination liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
the  gain realized from the completion of the sale in july  including the termination of the sublease  was recognized as an adjustment to the carrying value of the asset held for sale in ii impairment of goodwill and tradenames in goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized to expense and must be reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
the first step of the impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
if fair value exceeds book value  goodwill is considered not impaired  and the second step of the impairment test is not required 
if book value exceeds fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
for this step the implied fair value of the goodwill is compared with the book value of the goodwill 
if the book value amount of the good will exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
any loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
after an impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill is its new accounting basis 
subsequent reversal of a previously recognized impairment loss is prohibited once the measurement of that loss is completed 
when we have goodwill or other intangible assets not subject to amortization recorded in our consolidated balance sheet  we perform impairment testing at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is the same as  or one level below  an operating segment 
our annual impairment testing is typically performed during the fourth quarter of each year  which coincides with the timing of our annual budgeting and forecasting process 
we also make judgments about goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment in the value of such asset recorded on our consolidated balance sheet may exist 
the timing of an impairment test may result in charges to our consolidated statements of operations in future reporting periods that co uld not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods 
in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization  we typically prepare discounted cash flow analyses income approach and comparable company market multiples analyses market approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
for the income approach  we project future cash flows for each reporting unit 
this approach requires significant judgments including the projected net cash flows  the weighted average cost of capital wacc used to discount the cash flows and terminal value assumptions 
we derive the assumptions related to cash flows primarily from our internal budgets and forecasts 
these budgets and forecasts include information related to our current and future products  revenues  capacity  operating costs  and other information 
all such information is derived in the context of our long term operational strategies 
the wacc and terminal value assumptions are based on the capital structure  cost of capital  inherent business risk profiles  and industry outlooks for each of our reporting units  and for our company on a consolidated basis 
for the market approach  we identify reasonably similar public companies for each of our reporting units  analyze the financial and operating performance of these similar companies relative to our financial and operating performance  calculate market multiples primarily based on the ratio of business enterprise value bev to revenue and bev to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  adjust such multiples for differences between the similar companies and our reporting units  and apply the resulting multiples to the fundamentals of our reporting units to arrive at an indication of fair value 
to assess the reasonableness of our valuations under each method  we reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units to our market capitalization 
in conjunction with our goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessment performed in the fourth quarter of  we determined that all of our goodwill was impaired and that a portion of our tradenames intangible asset was impaired 
these impairment charges were recorded in the fourth quarter of a summary of impairment charges by segment follows amounts in thousands goodwill tradenames total surgical products segment brachytherapy seed segment total impairment charges in ii our market capitalization declined significantly in the fourth quarter of  along with the significant declines in the overall market value of all of the major stock markets in the united states and around the world 
we considered our market capitalization when we developed the appropriate discount rates and comparable company market multiples for purposes of estimating the fair value of our reporting units 
the significant decline in our market capitalization resulted in discount rates that were considerably higher  and comparable company market multiples that were considerably lower  than the discount rates and comparable company market multiples we previously considered appropriate 
the most significant assumption leading to our impairment charges in the fourth quarter of was the various di scount rates for our reporting units  all of which exceeded at that point in time 
we attempted to identify the underlying reasons for this circumstance 
we considered many factors  including the conditions of the companies in our sectors  unusual short selling or other unusual activity in the trading of our common stock  and whether the overall general economic outlook and stock market declines could be considered as temporary 
we were unable to identify any of these factors as directly affecting the decline in our market capitalization 
the long term expectations for our reporting units did not materially change during the period 
we concluded that the significant increase in our discount rates and decrease in our comparable company market multiples was a result of the increased risk associated with the distressed equity and credit markets generally  especially as these factors relate to a small company such as ours 
in ad dition  we believe the increasing prevalence of shareholders and investors trading securities outside of traditional stock exchanges contributes to share price volatility  especially over the short term 
finally  the scarcity of capital  especially for smaller companies such as ours  affects the risks associated with investments in its common stock and its share price 
in connection with our goodwill and tradenames impairment testing in the fourth quarter of  we also assessed the estimated useful lives of our tradenames 
at december   we determined that current facts and circumstances no longer supported an indefinite life for our tradenames intangible asset 
in considering all of the facts and circumstances at that time  including the increased risk associated with our businesses as perceived by investors  the distressed general equity and credit markets  especially as these factors relate to smaller companies such as ours  and the significant economic uncertainties caused by the worsening overall economic conditions  we concluded that an indefinite life for our tradenames intangible assets was no longer supportable 
we also considered changes to our te rminal value assumptions in our estimate of fair value for each reporting unit  which affected assumptions beyond year in our cash flow forecasts 
accordingly  we estimated that the remaining useful life of the recorded amount of our tradenames was years  and we began to amortize tradenames over years beginning in prior to december   we estimated that our tradenames intangible assets had indeterminate lives and  accordingly  were not subject to amortization 
we also review long lived assets  including our intangible assets subject to amortization  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
we group these assets at the lowest level that we could reasonably estimate the identifiable cash flows 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of long lived assets to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by these assets 
if the carrying amounts exceed the future undiscounted cash flows  then the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value 
as a result of the impairment indicators related to goodwill and tradenames  we tested our long lived assets for impairment at december   and determined that there was no impairment 
non operating income expense interest income decreased from million in to  in due to significantly lower yields on our investment portfolio 
during we had significant investments in auction rate securities 
these investments provided relatively higher returns than we experienced in  but they also turned out to be illiquid and riskier than expected 
we liquidated our auction rate securities in late and early at full value and without incurring any losses to principal 
however  due to the uncertainties and risks inherent in the current investment and credit markets  our investment portfolio in was much more conservatively invested than it was in interest expense was  in compared to  in we maintained higher weighted average outstanding balances under our credit facility during this was offset by a lower effective interest rate 
our weighted average effective interest rate was at december  in addition  fair value adjustments related to our interest rate swaps are included in interest expense in such fair value adjustments are unrealized losses and totaled  in income tax expense our effective income tax rate was in our effective income tax rate for was a benefit of 
these rates include federal and state income taxes 
our effective income tax rate in was significantly affected by our non cash impairment charges of goodwill and tradenames 
the majority of these impairment charges were not deductible for income tax purposes and  accordingly  the associated tax benefit was not significant 
ii critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatme nt of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap  with no need for our judgment in their application 
the accounting policies described below are those which we believe are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and are areas in which our judgment in selecting an available alternative might produce a materially different result 
marketable securities 
we review our investments in marketable securities for impairment based on both quantitative and qualitative criteria that include the extent to which cost exceeds market value  the duration of any market decline  our intent and ability to hold to maturity or expected recovery  and the creditworthiness of the issuer 
we perform research and analysis  and monitor market conditions to identify potential impairments 
due to the severe volatility and disruptions related to the us and global investment and credit markets  we are exposed to the risk of changes in fair value of our marketable securities in future periods  which may cause us to take impairment charges that we do not currently anticipate 
while we will continue to research  analyze and monitor our investments  we cannot predict what the effect of current investment and credit market circumstances might have on our portfolio going forward 
you can find more information related to the valuation of our marketable securities in note e in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  liquidity and capital resources in management s discussion and analysis  and item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  all of which are included in this report 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
our estimates can result in differences from the actual useful lives of certain assets 
the significant portion of property and equipment includes cyclotrons  which are utilized in our brachytherapy business  and manufacturing buildings 
as of december   we owned and operated eight cyclotrons  the first of which entered service in the estimated service life of our cyclotron equipment is years 
the estimated service life of our buildings is years 
we will continue to periodically examine estimates used for depreciation for reasonableness 
if we determine that the useful life of property or equipment should be shortened or lengthened  depreciation expense would be adjusted accordingly for the remaining useful lives of the identified assets 
we assess the impairment of our depreciable assets including property  equipment  and intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
in the event the expected undiscounted future cash flow attributable to the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
the estimation of fair value  whether in conjunction with an asset to be held and used or with an asset held for sale  also involves judgment 
it is possible that our estimates of fair value may change and impact our financial condition and results of operations 
as a result of the impairment indicators related to goodwill in the fourth quarter of  we performed an assessment of our long lived a ssets and determined that there was no impairment 
see impairment of goodwill and tradenames in above under results of operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized to expense and must be reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
the first step of the impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
if fair value exceeds book value  goodwill is considered not impaired  and the second step of the impairment test is not required 
if book value exceeds fair value  the second step of the impa irment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
for this step the implied fair value of the goodwill is compared with the book value of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
any loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
after an impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill is its new accounting basis 
subsequent reversal of a previously recognized impairment loss is prohibited once the measurement of that loss is completed 
ii when we have goodwill or other intangible assets not subject to amortization recorded in our consolidated balance sheet  we perform impairment testing at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is the same as  or one level below  an operating segment 
our annual impairment testing is typically performed during the fourth quarter of each year  which coincides with the timing of our annual budgeting and forecasting process 
we also make judgments about goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment in the value of such asset recorded on our consolidated balance sheet may exist 
the timing of an impairment test may result in charges to our consolidated statements of operations in future reporting periods that could not hav e been reasonably foreseen in prior periods 
in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization  we typically prepare discounted cash flow analyses income approach and comparable company market multiples analyses market approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
for the income approach  we project future cash flows for each reporting unit 
this approach requires significant judgments including the projected net cash flows  the weighted average cost of capital wacc used to discount the cash flows and terminal value assumptions 
we derive the assumptions related to cash flows primarily from our internal budgets and forecasts 
these budgets and forecasts include information related to our current and future products  revenues  capacity  operating costs  and other information 
all such information is derived in the context of our long term operational strategies 
the wacc and terminal value assumptions are based on the capital structure  cost of capital  inherent business risk profiles  and industry outlooks for each of our reporting units  and for our company on a consolidated basis 
for the market approach  we identify reasonably similar public companies for each of our reporting units  analyze the financial and operating performance of these similar companies relative to our financial and operating performance  calculate market multiples primarily based on the ratio of business enterprise value bev to revenue and bev to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  adjust such multiples for differences between the similar companies and our reporting units  and apply the resulting multiples to the fundamentals of our reporting units to arrive at an indication of fair value 
to assess the reasonableness of our valuations under each method  we reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units to our market capitalization 
in conjunction with our goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessment performed in the fourth quarter of  we determined that all of our goodwill was impaired and that a portion of our tradenames intangible asset was impaired 
see impairment of goodwill and tradenames in above under results of operations 
other intangible assets determined to have finite lives are amortized over their useful lives using a method that is expected to reflect the pattern of its economic benefit 
when a pattern of economic benefit cannot be determined  or if the straight line method results in greater amortization  then the straight line method is used 
to date  all finite lived intangible assets have been amortized using the straight line method 
we also review finite lived intangible assets for impairment to ensure they are appropriately valued if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
allowance for doubtful accounts and returns 
we make estimates and use our judgments in connection with establishing an allowance for the possibility that portions of our accounts receivable balances may become uncollectible or subject to return 
accounts receivable are reduced by this allowance 
specifically  we analyze accounts receivable in relation to customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  changes in our customer payment history  and changes in sales returns history in establishing this allowance 
it is possible that these or other underlying factors could change and impact our financial position and results of operations 
at december   we had an allowance for doubtful accounts in the amount of million related to one customer  core oncology 
we used our judgment in determining the amount due from core for which collection is doubtful 
in making this determination  our estimates and judgment included all facts and circumstances which existed at december   and developments occurring through february  the date we filed this annual report on form k 
we continue to pursue collection of all amounts due to us from core 
if core demonstrates an ability to pay any or all of the amounts previously considered doubtful  this would represent a change in our estimate 
any resulting change in estimate would in turn reduce our operating expenses in the period in which core demonstrates an ability to pay any or all of the amounts due to us 
allowance for obsolete inventory 
we review inventory periodically and record an estimated allowance for inventory that has become obsolete  that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value  or that is in excess of expected requirements 
specifically  we analyze inventory in relation to sales history  inventory turnover and days supply on hand  competing products  current economic trends  changes in our customers ordering histories  and historical write offs 
our estimate is subjective and dependent on our estimates of future demand for a particular product 
if our estimate of future demand exceeds actual demand  we may have to increase the allowance for obsolete inventory for that product and record a charge to cost of product sales 
ii asset retirement obligations 
we estimate the future cost of asset retirement obligations  discount that cost to its present value  and record a corresponding asset and liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
the values ultimately derived are based on many significant estimates  including future decommissioning costs  inflation  cost of capital  and market risk premiums 
the nature of these estimates requires us to make judgments based on historical experience and future expectations 
revisions to the estimates may be required based on such things as changes to cost estimates or the timing of future cash outlays 
any such changes that result in upward or downward revisions in the estimated obligation will result in an adjustment to the related capitalized asset and corresponding liability on a prospective basis 
our asset retirement obligations consist primarily of decommissioning obli gations related to our brachytherapy seed manufacturing equipment and facilities 
share based compensation 
we account for share based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of guidance issued by fasb 
under this method  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  we utilize the black scholes model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
the risk free interest rate and dividend yield are based on factual data derived from pu blic sources 
the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require significant judgment  which makes them critical accounting estimates 
our expected volatility is based upon weightings of the historical volatility of our stock 
with respect to the weighted average option life assumption  we consider the exercise behavior of past grants and model the pattern of aggregate exercises 
the grant date fair value of restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units collectively  the stock units are based on the fair value of the underlying common stock and is recognized over the requisite service period 
for stock units containing performance conditions  the grant date fair value is adjusted each period for the number of shares ultimately expected to be issued 
for stock units subject to discretionary performance conditions  the grant date has not been established and accordingly  the fair value of the award is updated each period for changes in the fair value of the underlying common stock 
to the extent that the underlying fair value of our common stock varies significantly  and or the number of shares issuable is determined  we may record additional compensation expense or adju st previously recognized compensation expense 
accounting for income taxes 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws and our interpretation of current tax laws 
we must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our tax provision and our deferred income tax assets and liabilities  including the valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could differ materially from our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes 
we periodically evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and recognize the tax benefit only as reassessment demonstrates that they are realizable 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assess the need for the valuation allowance each reporting period 
at such time  if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets are realizable  the valuation allowance is adjusted 
in the future if  based on the facts and circumstances surrounding our ability to generate adequate future taxable income  it becomes more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized  the valuation allowance may be required to be increased 
we review all of our tax positions 
the tax benefits of uncertain tax positions are recognized only if it is more likely than not that we will be able to sustain a position taken on an income tax return 
we have concluded that there were no significant uncertain tax positions as of december  and our policy is to recognize accrued interest expense and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense 
contingencies 
from time to time we may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims  including  for example  disputes  disputes on agreements  employment disputes and other commercial disputes  the outcomes of which are not within our complete control and may not be known for extended periods of time 
in some cases  the claimants seek damages  as well as other relief  which  if granted  could require significant expenditures 
we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for damages and or costs related to claims  settlements and judgments where we have assessed that a loss is probable and an amount can be reasonably estimated 
if the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely  we accrue the minimum amount of the range 
legal costs associated with these matters are expensed as incurred 
ii commitments and other contractual obligations contractual obligations we lease equipment and production  warehouse  office and other space under non cancelable leases that expire at various dates through may we also have million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility 
our contractual obligations as of december  are as follows amounts in thousands total less than year years years more than years obligation operating lease obligations rental space and equipment borrowings under credit agreement interest payable on borrowings total borrowings other obligations total represents minimum rental payments for operating leases  one of which is subject to adjustment based on the consumer price index 
includes million term loan payable at million annually through june  and million outstanding under million revolving credit facility  which matures october interest on outstanding borrowings under credit facility at december  is based on effective interest rates at december  letter of credit we have a letter of credit outstanding under the credit facility as of december  totaling  this letter of credit is related to asset retirement liabilities of long lived assets 
liquidity and capital resources we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating  investing and financing activities 
significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities  capital expenditures  operational investments to support growth such as research and development programs  and acquisitions of businesses and technologies 
we have cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million at december  marketable securities consisted primarily of high credit quality corporate and municipal obligations in accordance with our investment policies 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
we held no marketable securities at december  see cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities below for more information 
working capital was and million at december  and  respectively 
cash provided by operations was million in compared to million in cash provided by operations consists of net earnings  plus non cash expenses such as depreciation  amortization  deferred income taxes  and changes in balance sheet items such as accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid expenses and payables 
the decline in was primarily a result of the decline in net income  an increase in accounts receivable net of allowances in our brachytherapy segment resulting from increased revenue in the fourth quarter  and an increase in inventories to support growth in our surgical products segment 
the timing of payments for other current liabilities had a positive effect on cash flows compared to finally  cash from operations in also benefited from a million tax refund received during the year as a result of the use of an income tax loss generated in during  we had no significant remaining tax loss carryforwards and paid income taxes at our normal rates 
ii capital expenditures totaled million in and million in the expenditures were primarily for the construction of our new specialty needle manufacturing facility and  to a lesser extent  the development of our new erp system 
construction of our new facility was completed in july in the first quarter of  we implemented our new erp systems at two of our four primary locations with no significant interruptions in our day to day operations 
we expect to complete the erp implementation at our remaining locations over the next year 
looking forward  we expect our rate of capital expenditures to be less than as construction of our new needle manufacturing plant has been completed 
cash used by financing activities was million in compared to million in cash used for financing activities primarily consisted of principal repayments of our outstanding borrowings  in accordance with the terms of our credit facility 
the terms of our credit facility require principal payments of million annually through may r d expenses were million in and million in we expect to continue to use cash in to support growth in the surgical products segment  especially for r d 
looking forward  we expect r d expense levels in to be similar to however  r d activities can be complex  and expense levels are also dependent upon the discovery of opportunities of which we are not currently aware 
accordingly  r d expenses are subject to significant variability form period to period 
we may also continue to use cash for increased marketing and support activities in our brachytherapy seed business  and in the pursuit of additional diversification efforts such as product development  the purchase of technologies  products or companies  and other strategic initiatives 
we believe that current cash  cash equivalents  and investment balances and cash from future operations will be sufficient to meet our current short term anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
however  continued disruption and instability in the us and global financial markets and worldwide economies may hinder our ability to take advantage of opportunities for long term growth in our businesses 
in the event additional financing becomes necessary  we may choose to raise those funds through other means of financing as appro priate 
credit agreement we have a credit agreement with a financial institution which provides for up to million of borrowings under a revolving credit facility the revolver and a million term loan the term loan 
the revolver matures on october  with interest payable at the london interbank offered rate libor plus 
maximum borrowings under the revolver can be increased to million with the prior approval of the lender under an accordion feature 
as of december   borrowings of million and million were outstanding under the revolver and term loan  respectively  and letters of cred it totaling  representing decommission funding required by the georgia department of natural resources  were outstanding under the credit agreement 
the term loan is payable in thirty six equal monthly installments of  plus interest at libor plus  through july the credit agreement is unsecured but provides for a lien to be established on substantially all of our assets upon certain events of default 
the credit agreement contains representations and warranties  as well as affirmative  reporting and negative covenants customary for financings of this type 
among other things  the credit agreement restricts the incurrence of certain additional debt and requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios  including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  a maximum liabilities to tangible net worth ratio  and the maintenance of minimum liquid assets of million  as all such ratios and terms are defined in the credit agreement 
we amended our credit agreement effective as of june  the amendment to  among other things  temporarily reduce the quarterly minimum fixed charge coverage ratio to accommodate the unusually high rate of capital expenditures over the previous twelve months  principally related to our new specialty needle manufacturing facility 
the amendment also provides for the exclusion of certain moving related expenses to be incurred during from the fixed charge coverage ratio and eliminates the million limitation on annual capital expenditures 
the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio will gradually increase on a quarterly basis until it equ als the pre amendment ratio level for the quarterly measurement period ending march  and for subsequent measurement periods 
we were in compliance with all covenants  as amended  as of december  in the event that we do not maintain the required minimum fixed charge coverage ratio or comply with other covenants under the credit agreement  and an event of default occurs under the credit agreement that is not cured  waived or otherwise addressed  the financial institution could in certain circumstances accelerate the maturity of all borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement and claim a lien on substantially all of our assets 
as of december   we had outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement of million  cash and cash equivalents of million  and marketable securities of million 
we also have certain interest rate swap agreements to manage our variable interest rate exposure 
we entered into a floating to fixed rate swap with respect to the entire principal amount of the term loan  at a fixed interest rate of  and a separate floating to fixed rate swap with respect to million of the principal amount outstanding under the revolver  at a fixed interest rate of 
both interest rate swaps expire on june  our weighted average effective interest rate at december  was 
ii cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities our cash and cash equivalents include bank deposits  money market funds  us treasury securities  and commercial paper held at a limited number of financial institutions 
we review our investments in marketable securities and cash equivalents for impairment based on both quantitative and qualitative criteria that include the extent to which cost exceeds market value  the duration of any market decline  our intent and ability to hold to maturity or expected recovery  and the creditworthiness of the issuer 
we perform research and analysis  and monitor market conditions to identify potential impairments 
looking forward  we may invest our funds in higher yielding investments if those investments meet the conservative criteria established by our investment policies and the macroeconomic outlook becomes clearer 
fun ds available for investment have and will continue to be utilized for our current and future expansion programs  for strategic opportunities for growth and diversification  and for installment payments on the term loan 
as funds continue to be used for these purposes  and as interest rates continue to change  we expect interest income to fluctuate accordingly 
due to the disruptions  volatility and uncertainties related to the us and global investment and credit markets we are exposed to the risk of further changes in fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities in future periods  which may cause us to take impairment charges that are not currently anticipated 
while we will continue to research  analyze and monitor our investments  we cannot predict what the effect of current investment and credit market circumstances might have on our portfolio going forward 
medicare developments prior to  medicare continued to reimburse for brachytherapy seeds under the charges adjusted to costs methodology  which is based on the actual invoiced cost of the seeds and which we sometimes refer to as a pass through methodology 
consistent with proposals that cms attempted unsuccessfully to implement in recent years  cms published a final hospital opps on november  under this fixed opps  which went into effect on january   the per seed rate at which medicare reimburses hospitals for the purchase of seeds is fixed annually 
we sometimes refer to this system as fixed reimbursement 
we continue to support efforts that urge congress and cms to replace this fixed reimbursement rule by obtaining a new extension of the pass through reimbursement policies which existed prior to fixed reimbursement policies at cms can be expected to lead to pricing pressure from hospitals and other healthcare providers  and to have an adverse effect on our brachytherapy revenue 
the extent of the effect is impossible for us to predict  especially when fixed reimbursement policies are being introduced at a time that coincides with an industry wide decline in procedures being performed and  as a result  a decline in demand for brachytherapy products which is attributable  at least in part  to favorable cms reimbursement rates enjoyed by alternative  less proven  technologies and uncertainties regarding the implementation and impact of healthcare reform generally 
these factors could have an adverse effect on brachytherapy revenue

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we have exposure to market risk as a result of changing interest rates on a portion of our borrowings under our credit agreement 
we have outstanding borrowings of million under our credit agreement in the form of a term loan that is payable in equal monthly installments of approximately  plus interest through july interest is payable at libor plus 
we have entered into a floating to fixed rate swap agreement that expires in july with respect to the outstanding amount of the term loan at a fixed interest rate of 
we also have outstanding borrowings of million under the revolver component of our credit agreement 
the revolver matures in october interest on outstanding borrowings under the revolver is payable at libor plus 
we entere d into a separate floating to fixed rate swap that expires in july with respect to million of the principal amount outstanding under the revolver at a fixed interest rate of 
accordingly  we are exposed to changes in interest rates on outstanding borrowings in excess of million under our revolver 
a hypothetical change in the interest rate applicable to the borrowings in excess of million would result in an increase or decrease in interest expense of  per year before income taxes  assuming the same level of borrowings 
ii we review our investments in marketable securities and cash equivalents for impairment based on both quantitative and qualitative criteria that include the extent to which cost exceeds market value  the duration of any market decline  our intent and ability to hold to maturity or expected recovery  and the creditworthiness of the issuer 
we perform research and analysis  and monitor market conditions to identify potential impairments 
due to the uncertainties related to the us and global investment and credit markets we are exposed to the risk of further changes in fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities in future periods  which may cause us to take impairment charges that are not currently anticipated 
while we will continue to research  analyze and monitor our investments  we cannot predict what the effect of current investment and credit market circumstances might have on our portfolio going forward
