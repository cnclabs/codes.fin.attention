table of contents many nations have adopted or are considering regulation of carbon dioxide co emissions 
the integrated steel process involves a series of chemical reactions involving carbon that create co emissions 
this distinguishes integrated steel producers from mini mills and many other industries where co generation is generally linked to energy usage 
in the united states  the environmental protection agency epa has published rules for regulating greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities and has implemented various reporting requirements 
in the last congress  legislation was passed in the house of representatives and introduced in the senate 
we do not know what action  if any  may be taken by the new congress 
the eu has established greenhouse gas regulations and canada has published details of a regulatory framework for greenhouse gas emissions 
such regulations may entail substantial costs for emission allowances  restriction of production  and higher prices for coking coal  natural gas and electricity generated by carbon based systems 
some foreign nations such as china and india are not aggressively pursuing regulation of co and integrated steel producers in such countries may achieve a competitive advantage over u

raw materials and energy as an integrated producer  u 
s 
steel s primary raw materials are iron units in the form of iron ore pellets and sinter ore  carbon units in the form of coal and coke which is produced from coking coal and steel scrap 
u 
s 
steel s raw materials supply strategy consists of acquiring and expanding captive sources of these primary raw materials and entering into multi year supply contracts 
the amounts of such raw materials needed to produce a ton of steel will fluctuate based upon the specifications of the final steel products  the quality of raw materials and  to a lesser extent  differences among steel producing equipment

table of contents coke logo in north america  the flat rolled segment operates cokemaking facilities at the clairton plant of mon valley works  gary works  granite city works  hamilton works and lake erie works 
in europe  the usse segment operates cokemaking facilities at ussk 
blast furnace injection of coal  natural gas and self generated coke oven gas is also used at certain flat rolled and usse facilities to reduce coke usage 
the increase in coke production in was mainly due to the inclusion of production at lake erie works and hamilton works for the entire year following the ussc acquisition in the decrease in coke production in resulted from the temporary idling of cokemaking facilities at the clairton plant  granite city works  hamilton works and lake erie works for part of the year as well as the shut down of three coke batteries at the clairton plant 
in  we restarted the facilities that were idled in  resulting in an increase in coke production 
over the next five years  as some of our north american coke batteries approach the end of their expected useful lives  our production capability is likely to decrease absent additional investment in coke or coke substitute production facilities 
we have taken a number of steps to ensure long term access to high quality coke for our blast furnaces 
we have restarted engineering and construction of a technologically and environmentally advanced battery at the clairton plant  with production capability of approximately  tons 
we entered into a year coke supply agreement with gateway energy coke company  llc gateway in connection with its  ton per year heat recovery coke plant which began operating in the fourth quarter of and is located at granite city works 
also  we have begun construction of a carbon alloy facility at gary works which will utilize state of the art technology to produce a carbon alloy material that will be used as a coke substitute and we continue to evaluate plans to construct additional carbon alloy facilities 
the carbon alloy facility is expected to have production capability of approximately  tons per year 
with flat rolled s current cokemaking facilities and the gateway long term supply agreement  it has the capability to supply approximately percent of its annual coke requirements at normal operating levels 
during  we will purchase additional coke on the open market  of which we anticipate approximately half will be supplied domestically with the remainder supplied by imports  potentially at higher costs 
to the extent that it is necessary or appropriate considering existing needs and or applicable transportation costs  coke is purchased from or swapped with suppliers or other end users 
usse s cokemaking facilities currently have the capability to supply approximately of its annual coke requirements at normal operating levels 
the remainder of usse s needs is purchased from outside sources 
the main sources of coke for usse in are expected to be poland  ukraine  russia  bosnia  hungary and the czech republic 
steel scrap and other materials we believe that supplies of steel scrap and other alloying and coating materials required to fulfill the requirements for flat rolled and usse are available from outside sources at competitive market prices 
generally  approximately percent of our steel scrap requirements are internally generated through normal operations 
limestone all of flat rolled s limestone requirements are purchased from outside sources 
we believe that supplies of limestone adequate to meet flat rolled s needs are readily available from outside sources at competitive market prices 
the majority of usse s limestone requirements are purchased from outside sources with a portion of usss s raw limestone requirements coming from its mine in ku evo  serbia 
we believe that supplies of limestone adequate to meet usse s needs are available from outside sources at competitive market prices 

table of contents zinc and tin we believe that supplies of zinc and tin required to fulfill the requirements for flat rolled and usse are available from outside sources at competitive market prices 
we routinely execute fixed price forward physical purchase contracts for a portion of our expected business needs in order to manage our exposure to the volatility of the zinc and tin markets 
natural gas all of u 
s 
steel s natural gas requirements are purchased from outside sources 
we believe that supplies adequate to meet flat rolled s needs are available at competitive market prices 
in order to partially manage our exposure to natural gas price increases as it relates to customers with fixed priced contracts as well as electricity costs from a generating facility located at one of our facilities  we routinely execute fixed price forward physical purchase contracts for natural gas 
about percent of our natural gas purchases in flat rolled are based on bids solicited on a monthly basis from various vendors  the remainder is made daily or with term agreements or with fixed price forward physical purchase contracts 
we believe that supplies adequate to meet usse s needs are normally available at competitive market prices 
however  both ussk and usss experienced a supply curtailment of more than ten days in january related to russia s suspension of natural gas shipments to europe 
the supply from russia and the transmission through ukraine and the associated political tension may impact supply availability 
both flat rolled and usse use self generated coke oven and blast furnace gas to reduce consumption of natural gas 
industrial gases u 
s 
steel purchases its industrial gas requirements under long term contracts with various suppliers 
commercial sales of product u 
s 
steel characterizes sales as contract if sold pursuant to an agreement with defined volume and pricing and a duration of longer than three months  and as spot if sold without a defined volume and pricing agreement 
in approximately percent  percent and percent of sales by flat rolled  usse and tubular  respectively  were contract sales 
some contract pricing agreements include fixed price while others are adjusted periodically based upon published prices of steel products or cost components 
u 
s 
steel does not consider sales backlog to be a meaningful measure since volume commitments in most contracts are based on each customer s specific periodic requirements 
environmental matters u 
s 
steel maintains a comprehensive environmental policy 
the executive environmental committee  which is comprised of u 
s 
steel officers  meets regularly to review environmental issues and compliance 
both the board of directors and the corporate governance and public policy committee receive regular updates on environmental matters 
the compensation and organization committee has made annual improvement one of four performance measures for short term incentive compensation 
also  u 
s 
steel  largely through the american iron and steel institute  the canadian steel producers association  the world steel association and european confederation of iron and steel industries eurofer  is involved in the promotion of cost effective environmental strategies through the development of appropriate air  water  waste and climate change laws and regulations at the local  state  national and international levels 
u 
s 
steel s businesses in the united states are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
these environmental laws and regulations include the clean air act caa with respect to air emissions  the clean water act cwa with respect to water discharges  the resource conservation and recovery act rcra with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment  storage and 
table of contents disposal  and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances 
in addition  all states where u 
s 
steel operates have similar laws dealing with the same matters 
these laws are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly stringent 
the ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable due in part to the fact that certain implementing regulations for these environmental laws have not yet been promulgated and in certain instances are undergoing revision 
these environmental laws and regulations  particularly the caa  could result in substantially increased capital  operating and compliance costs 
ussc is subject to the environmental laws of canada  which are comparable to environmental standards in the united states 
environmental regulation in canada is an area of shared responsibility between the federal government and the provincial governments  which in turn delegate certain matters to municipal governments 
federal environmental statutes include the federal canadian environmental protection act  and the fisheries act 
various provincial statutes regulate environmental matters such as the release and remediation of hazardous substances  waste storage  treatment and disposal  and air emissions 
as in the united states  canadian environmental laws federal  provincial and local are undergoing revisions and becoming more stringent 
ussk is subject to the environmental laws of slovakia and the eu 
a related law of the eu commonly known as registration  evaluation  authorisation and restriction of chemicals  regulation reach requires the registration of certain substances that are produced in the eu or imported into the eu 
ussk currently expects to be able to continue its businesses under reach without material change 
ussk has completed all notifications required by the eu s clp regulation  a classification and labeling law 
usss is subject to the environmental laws of serbia 
under the terms of the acquisition in  usss is responsible for only those costs and liabilities associated with environmental events occurring subsequent to the completion of an environmental baseline study in june  which was submitted to the government of serbia 
u 
s 
steel has incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital  operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations which in recent years have been mainly for process changes in order to meet caa obligations and similar obligations in europe and canada 
in the future  compliance with carbon dioxide co emission requirements may include substantial costs for emission allowances  restriction of production and higher prices for coking coal  natural gas and electricity generated by carbon based systems 
since it is difficult to predict what requirements will ultimately be imposed in the united states and canada  it is difficult to estimate the likely impact on u 
s 
steel  but it could be substantial 
to the extent these expenditures  as with all costs  are not ultimately reflected in the prices of u 
s 
steel s products and services  operating results will be reduced 
u 
s 
steel believes that our major north american and many european integrated steel competitors are confronted with substantially similar conditions and thus does not believe that its relative position with regard to such competitors will be materially affected by the impact of environmental laws and regulations 
however  if the final requirements do not recognize the fact that the integrated steel process involves a series of chemical reactions involving carbon that create co emissions  our competitive position relative to mini mills will be adversely impacted and our competitive position regarding producers in developing nations  such as china and india  will be harmed unless such nations require comensurate reductions in co emissions 
competing materials such as plastics may not be similarly impacted 
the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors  including the age and location of its operating facilities and its production methods 
u 
s 
steel is also responsible for remediation costs related to former and present operating locations and disposal of environmentally sensitive materials 
many of our competitors  including north american producers  or their successors  that have been the subject of bankruptcy relief have no or substantially lower liabilities for such matters 
greenhouse gas emissions regulation the current and potential regulation of greenhouse gas emissions remains a significant issue for the steel industry  particularly for integrated steel producers such as u 
s 
steel 
the regulation of co emissions has either become law or is being considered by legislative bodies of many nations  including countries where we have operating facilities 
in the united states  the epa has published rules for regulating greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities and has implemented various reporting requirements as further described below 
in the last congress  legislation was passed in the house of representatives and introduced in the senate 
we do not know what 
table of contents action  if any  may be taken by the new congress 
the eu has established greenhouse gas regulations while in canada  a regulatory framework for greenhouse gas emissions has been published  details of which are discussed below 
international negotiations to supplement and eventually replace the kyoto protocol are ongoing 
the us epa has classified co 

as a harmful gas 
under this premise  it has implemented a new greenhouse gas emission inventory and reporting requirement for all facilities emitting  metric tons or more per year of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gases coe 
the regulation requires facilities to collect information on coe and report emissions to the epa by march   covering the calendar year 
most domestic u 
s 
steel facilities are required to comply with the new reporting requirements and u 
s 
steel has implemented monitoring plans to meet this requirement 
on may  the epa published its final greenhouse gas tailoring rule establishing a mechanism for regulating greenhouse gas emissions from facilities through the caa s prevention of significant deterioration psd permitting process 
starting january   new projects that increase greenhouse gas emissions by more than  tons per year  will have new psd requirements based on best available control technology bact  but only if the project also significantly increases emissions of at least one non greenhouse gas pollutant 
only existing sources with title v permits or new sources obtaining title v permits for non greenhouse gas pollutants will also be required to address greenhouse gas emissions 
starting july  new sources not already subject to title v requirements that emit over  tons per year of greenhouse gas emissions  or modifications to existing permits that increase greenhouse gas emissions by more than  tons per year  will be subject to psd and title v requirements 
on november  the epa issued its psd and title v permitting guidance for greenhouse gases and available and emerging technologies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the iron and steel industry 
through this guidance  the epa intends to help state and local air permitting authorities identify greenhouse gas reduction options under the caa 
u 
s 
steel is currently evaluating the cost of compliance with these regulations 
the european commission ec has created an emissions trading system ets 
under the ets  the ec establishes co emissions limits for every eu member state and approves grants of co emission allowances to individual emitting facilities pursuant to national allocation plans that are proposed by each of the member states 
the allowances can be bought and sold by emitting facilities to cover the quantities of co they emit in their operations 
in july  slovakia granted ussk co emission allowances as part of the national allocation plan for the to trading period nap ii approved by the european commission 
based on actual carbon emissions to date  we believe that ussk will have sufficient allowances for the nap ii period without purchasing additional allowances 
ussk entered into transactions to sell and swap a portion of our emissions allowances and recognized gains related to these transactions of approximately million and million in the years ended december and  respectively 
in december  an amendment to the slovak income tax law was adopted that includes a provision for an percent tax on excess emission allowances registered in and the amount of this tax will vary with ussk s production levels and the implementing regulations that may be issued 
on april   canada s federal government announced an action plan to reduce greenhouse gases and air pollution the plan 
the plan would set mandatory reduction targets on all major greenhouse gas producing industries to achieve an absolute reduction of megatonnes in greenhouse gas emissions from levels by on march   canada s federal government published details of its regulatory framework for industrial greenhouse gas emissions the framework 
the plan and the framework provide that facilities existing in will be required to cut their greenhouse gas emissions intensity by percent below their baseline by  with a further two percent reduction in each following year 
the framework provided that newer and future facilities would be subject to phased in two percent annual emissions intensity reduction obligations and clean fuel standards 
companies will be able to choose the most cost effective way to meet their targets from a range of options which include carbon trading  offsets and credit for early action between and 
the framework effectively exempts fixed process emissions of co  which could exclude certain iron and steel producing co emissions from mandatory reductions 
more recently  the federal government has indicated that while it remains committed to reducing canada s total greenhouse gas emissions by percent from levels 
table of contents by  this target is subject to adjustment to remain consistent with the us at this point  it is unclear when canadian federal regulations on greenhouse gas emissions will be developed and whether they will reflect aspects of the approach set out in the plan and the framework 
the federal government has indicated that it is working in collaboration with the provinces towards the development of a cap and trade system that will ultimately be aligned with the emerging cap and trade program in the united states 
on june   canada s federal government released for comment two draft guides related to the establishment of an offset system in canada 
these draft documents propose rules and provide guidance on the requirements and processes to create offset credits and the requirements and processes to verify the eligible greenhouse gas reductions achieved from an offset project 
canada s federal government has stated that  once in place  the offset system will compliment the proposed cap and trade system and help in generating greenhouse gas emissions reductions across the country 
if greenhouse gas cap and trade legislation becomes law in canada  it could have economic and operational consequences for u

in december  the ontario government announced its own action plan on climate change the ontario action plan 
the ontario action plan targets reductions in ontario greenhouse gas emissions of six percent below levels by  percent below levels by and percent below levels by in december  ontario launched a consultation process towards the development of a cap and trade system and in may  the ontario government released a discussion paper regarding cap and trade 
the ontario government has amended the environmental protection act in order to provide the regulatory authority to set up a greenhouse gas cap and trade system  however  such a system has not yet been developed 
the ontario government also passed a greenhouse gas emissions reporting regulation the regulation on december  the regulation is intended to provide the foundation for ontario to implement a cap and trade program for greenhouse gases 
the regulation requires facilities that emit more than  tons of coe or more per year to annually report their emissions  starting with emissions 
the ontario government has indicated that it plans to develop a cap and trade system that aligns with other systems being developed in north america  including in the united states

air the caa imposes stringent limits on air emissions with a federally mandated operating permit program and civil and criminal enforcement sanctions 
the caa requires  among other things  the regulation of hazardous air pollutants through the development and promulgation of maximum achievable control technology mact standards 
the epa has developed various industry specific mact standards pursuant to this requirement 
the caa requires epa to promulgate regulations establishing emission standards for each category of hazardous air pollutants 
epa must also conduct risk assessments on each source category that is already subject to mact standards and determine if additional standards are needed to reduce residual risks 
the principal impact of the mact standards on u 
s 
steel operations includes those that are specific to cokemaking  ironmaking  steelmaking and iron ore processing 
the emission limitations for ironmaking and steelmaking sources could become more stringent if epa s residual risk analysis indicates that additional controls are necessary 
epa is required to complete this residual risk analysis by the iron and steel mact is subject to a legal challenge by sierra club 
in june  the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit granted epa s motion for voluntary remand of the iron and steel mact 
epa is in the process of generating an information collection request to develop the revised mact 
the impact of this risk analysis and any subsequent changes cannot be estimated at this time 
u 
s 
steel s cokemaking facilities are subject to two categories of mact standards 
the first category applies to pushing and quenching 
epa is required to make a risk based determination for pushing and quenching emissions and determine whether additional emissions reductions are necessary from this process by epa has yet to publish or propose any residual risk standards from these operations  therefore  the impact cannot be estimated at this time 
the second category of mact standards applying to coke facilities applies to emissions from charging  
table of contents coke oven battery tops and coke oven doors 
with regard to these standards  u 
s 
steel chose to install more stringent controls than mact on some of its batteries  called lowest achievable emissions reductions laer 
such laer batteries are not required to comply with certain residual risk standards until because the scope of these anticipated changes are distant and relatively uncertain  the magnitude of the impact of these anticipated changes cannot be estimated at this time 
u 
s 
steel s iron ore processing operations are subject to the taconite iron ore processing mact standards 
these standards may change if epa revises the mact standards in response to a petition filed by an environmental advocacy group 
in addition  epa will make a risk based determination for taconite iron ore processing and determine whether additional emissions reductions are necessary from this process by epa has yet to publish or propose any residual risk standards from these operations  therefore  the impact of any changes cannot be estimated at this time 
the caa also requires the epa to develop and implement national ambient air quality standards naaqs for criteria pollutants  which include  among others  particulate matter and ozone 
in  epa established hour and annual standards for fine particles that are less than micrometers in size and in  epa tightened the hour standard but retained the annual standard 
these standards were challenged and the us court of appeals for the district of columbia  in american farm bureau federation and national pork producers council et al 
v 
epa  f 
rd dc cir 
 remanded the annual standards to the epa for further consideration but allowed the hour standard to remain in effect 
states were required to demonstrate compliance with the fine particle standard by april  unless epa granted the state or local jurisdiction an extension 
extensions may be granted through april many states and jurisdictions in which u 
s 
steel operates received a five year extension  requiring that the area demonstrate compliance by april in addition  the annual standard could change based upon the remand noted above 
if the standard is changed  states will be required to modify their state implementation plans sips to meet the new standard 
on december   epa designated areas in which u 
s 
steel operates as nonattainment and unclassified attainment for the fine particle standard 
sips for the hour standard are due december   with attainment demonstrations with the standard expected to be made by or  with extensions 
it is anticipated that epa s fine particle programs could result in significant costs to u 
s 
steel 
while the sips for the current annual standard were due in april  many states and local agencies in which u 
s 
steel facilities are located have not yet or are just now proposing sips 
u 
s 
steel is currently reviewing these drafts and proposed sips  but the impacts of the anticipated regulations cannot be determined at this time 
furthermore  it is impossible to estimate the magnitude of any costs associated with the sips for the hour standard or the remand of the annual standard since the state and federal agencies are still developing regulations for the programs and implementation for the hour standard 
demonstrating attainment with the hour standard is not expected until sometime between and and no new standard or associated timeline has been established for the annual standard 
effective may  epa lowered its ground level ozone air quality standards  which could affect sources of nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compounds  including coke plants  and iron and steel facilities 
however  in response to a legal challenge of the may ground level ozone naaqs  epa has proposed to lower the naaqs from what was promulgated in may epa has stated it will promulgate a final rule with a lower naaqs for ozone by july epa is required to issue final designations of attainment  nonattainment and unclassifiable areas no later than march for the standard promulgated in may in addition  epa will need to again designate areas pursuant to any standard promulgated in july the designations would be two years with up to one year extension from the date of promulgation of the new standard 
states must submit sips outlining how they will reduce pollution to meet the standards by a date that is no later than three years after epa s final designations 
if epa issues designations in as it has indicated  these plans would be due no later than states are required to meet the standards by deadlines that may vary based on the severity of the problem in the area 
it is anticipated that the ozone naaqs revisions could result in significant costs to u 
s 
steel  however  it is impossible to estimate the magnitude of these costs at this time since the implementation dates are unknown and distant

u 
s 
steel cannot predict the duration of the difficult economic conditions and the trajectory of the recovery but both will have a significant impact on u 
s 
steel 

table of contents u 
s 
steel and its end product markets continue to be impacted by challenging economic conditions 
the global economic recession that began in resulted in significantly lower demand and prices across all of our segments and major markets 
average realized price net ton flat rolled u 
s 
steel europe tubular steel shipments flat rolled u 
s 
steel europe tubular total steel shipments raw steel capability utilization flat rolled u 
s 
steel europe consolidated net loss income attributable to united states steel corporation consolidated net loss income per diluted share attributable to united states steel corporation while some of our end customer markets supplied by our flat rolled and usse segments  such as automotive  saw modest recoveries during  others  such as construction  remain severely depressed 
oil and gas drilling activity remains below levels  which has resulted in lower customer demand for the products of our tubular segment 
our operating levels and prices may remain at depressed levels until our customers demand increases 
we face the additional risk of further declines if economic conditions worsen 
china and certain other steel markets were affected less by the global recession and rebounded more quickly in some cases to and even beyond levels 
as a result  steel production serving these markets has increased  which has caused prices for iron ore  metallurgical coal and other raw materials to increase 
this development has and will continue to cause our costs to increase regardless of the state of recovery in our end markets 
u 
s 
steel may need to substantially increase working capital as market conditions and order levels continue to improve 
as business conditions have started to recover  our working capital requirements have increased and any future increases may require us to draw upon our credit facilities 
in general  availability under our five year million revolving credit facility  which was amended and restated in  amended credit agreement is limited to a monthly borrowing base of certain eligible domestic inventory and availability under our receivables purchase agreement rpa is limited to eligible receivables 
any borrowings would increase our cost  and we may not have sufficient eligible inventory and receivables to borrow the amounts we need 
in addition  if availability under the amended credit agreement falls below the greater of percent of the total aggregate commitments and million  we would also be subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant 
the usss million credit facility and overdraft facility of up to billion serbian dinars which together totaled approximately million at december  also contain a borrowing base limit based upon inventory values 
u 
s 
steel may face increased risks of customer and supplier defaults 
there is an increased risk of insolvency and other credit related issues of our customers and suppliers  including their need to increase working capital as their businesses improve 
we believe some of our customers and suppliers may not have sufficient credit available to them  which could delay payments from customers  result in increased customer defaults and cause our suppliers to delay filling  or to be unable to fill  our needs 

table of contents u 
s 
steel s joint ventures and other equity investees are also being affected by ongoing challenging economic conditions 
u 
s 
steel s joint ventures and other equity affiliates are also engaged in the production of steelmaking raw materials and finishing of flat rolled and tubular products 
as such  they face many of the same issues we do 
since these entities are smaller than u 
s 
steel  they may have fewer resources available to them to respond to ongoing challenging economic conditions 
risk factors concerning the steel industry steel consumption is highly cyclical  and worldwide overcapacity in the steel industry and the availability of alternative products have resulted in intense competition  which may have an adverse effect on profitability and cash flow  especially during periods of economic weakness 
steel consumption is highly cyclical and generally follows economic and industrial conditions both worldwide and in regional markets 
the steel industry has historically been characterized by excess global supply  which has led to substantial price decreases during periods of economic weakness 
substitute materials are increasingly available for many steel products  which further reduces demand for steel 
rapidly growing supply in china and other developing economies may grow faster than real demand in those economies  which may result in additional excess worldwide capacity and falling steel prices 
over the last several years  steel consumption in china and other developing economies has increased at a rapid pace 
steel companies have responded by rapidly increasing steel production capability in those countries and published reports state that further capacity increases are likely 
steel production capability  especially in china  now appears to be well in excess of china s home market demand 
because china is now the largest worldwide steel producer by a significant margin  any excess chinese supply could have a major impact on world steel trade and prices if this excess and subsidized production is exported to other markets 
since the chinese steel industry is largely government owned  it has not been as adversely impacted by the ongoing difficult economic conditions  and it can make production and sales decisions for non market reasons 
increased imports of steel products into north america and europe could negatively affect steel prices and demand levels and reduce our profitability 
steel imports to the united states accounted for an estimated percent of the domestic steel market in  percent in and percent in foreign competitors may have lower labor costs  and some are owned  controlled or subsidized by their governments  which allows their production and pricing decisions to be influenced by political and economic policy considerations as well as prevailing market conditions 
imports of tubular products to the united states increased significantly beginning in oil country tubular goods octg imports accounted for a large share of the growth  as they have more than doubled over levels 
imports of octg from china registered the most dramatic increase as they grew from thousand tons in to nearly million tons in the us market experienced a surge in tubular imports in the second half of that resulted in record octg inventories by the end of the year  which affected demand in chinese imports of seamless standard line and pressure pipe increased by more than percent in the three months after the filing of antidumping and countervailing duty petitions in september  as compared to the three months prior to the filing 
imports of flat rolled steel to canada accounted for an estimated percent of the canadian market for flat rolled steel products in  percent in and percent in total imports of flat rolled carbon steel products to the eu the countries currently comprising the eu were percent of the eu market in  percent in and percent in increases in future levels of imported steel to north america and europe could reduce future market prices and demand levels for steel products produced in those markets 

table of contents imports into the united states  canada and the eu have often violated the international trade laws of these jurisdictions 
while in some cases u 
s 
steel and others have been successful in obtaining relief under these laws  in other circumstances relief has not been received 
when received  such relief is generally subject to automatic or discretionary recision or reduction 
there can be no assurance that any such relief will be obtained or continued in the future or that such relief as obtained will be adequate 
limited availability of raw materials and energy may constrain operating levels and reduce profit margins 
u 
s 
steel and other steel producers have periodically been faced with problems in obtaining sufficient raw materials and energy in a timely manner due to delays or defaults by suppliers  shortages or transportation problems such as shortages of barges  ocean vessels  rail cars or trucks  or disruption of rail lines  waterways or natural gas transmission lines  resulting in production curtailments 
we do not produce enough coke to meet our global requirements and our coke production capability is likely to decline over the next several years given that some of our existing coke batteries in the united states are approaching the end of their useful lives 
as a result  we may be further exposed to risks concerning pricing and availability of coke from third parties 
usse purchases substantially all of its iron ore and coking coal requirements from outside sources 
usse is also dependent upon availability of natural gas produced in russia and transported through ukraine 
usse experienced natural gas supply curtailments during russia s suspension of natural gas shipments to europe in january  resulting in steel production curtailments  escalated costs and reduced profit margins 
any future curtailments and escalated costs may further reduce profit margins 
environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs 
steel producers in the united states are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
these laws continue to evolve and are becoming increasingly stringent 
the ultimate impact of complying with such laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision 
environmental laws and regulations  particularly the clean air act  could result in substantially increased capital  operating and compliance costs 
international environmental requirements vary 
while standards in the eu  canada and japan are generally comparable to us standards  other nations  particularly china  have substantially lesser requirements that may give competitors in such nations a competitive advantage 
greenhouse gas policies could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows 
the integrated steel process involves a series of chemical reactions involving carbon that create co this distinguishes integrated steel producers from mini mills and many other industries where co generation is generally linked to energy usage 
in the united states  the environmental protection agency epa has published rules for regulating greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities and has implemented various reporting requirements 
in the last congress  legislation was passed in the house of representatives and introduced in the senate 
we do not know what action  if any  may be taken by the new congress 
the eu has established greenhouse gas regulations and canada has published details of a regulatory framework for greenhouse gas emissions 
for a discussion of these  see part i business environmental matters 
we cannot predict the final requirements that may be adopted in the united states and canada  or the form of future actions that may be taken by the eu  however  such limitations could entail substantial costs for emission allowances restriction of production and higher prices for coking coal  natural gas and electricity generated by carbon based systems  which could have a negative effect on results of operations and cash flows 
since mini mill production does not involve the same chemical reactions as integrated production  mini mills may have a competitive advantage 
also  since china and many other developing nations have not instituted greenhouse gas regulations  and since past international agreements such as the kyoto protocol provided exemptions and lesser standards for developing nations  we may also be at a competitive disadvantage with certain foreign steel producers 
many of our customers in the united states  canada and europe may experience similar impacts  which could result in decreased demand for our products 

table of contents risk factors concerning u 
s 
steel legacy obligations our retiree health care and retiree life insurance plan costs  most of which are unfunded obligations  and our pension plan costs in north america are higher than those of many of our competitors 
these plans create a competitive disadvantage and negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows 
we maintain retiree health care and life insurance and defined benefit pension plans covering most of our north american employees and former employees upon their retirement 
as of december   approximately  current employees  retirees and beneficiaries are participating in the plans to receive pension and or medical benefits 
at december   on an accounting basis  u 
s 
steel s retiree medical and life insurance plans were underfunded by billion and our pension plans were underfunded by billion 
most of our employee benefits are subject to collective bargaining agreements with unionized workforces and will be subject to future negotiations 
minimum contributions to domestic qualified pension plans are controlled under erisa and other government regulations 
minimum contributions to u 
s 
steel canada ussc pension plans are governed by an agreement entered into by stelco inc stelco and the province of ontario that u 
s 
steel assumed in conjunction with the acquisition of stelco 
this agreement requires defined annual contributions until the earlier of full solvency funding for the four main plans or until december   when minimum funding requirements for the plans resume under the provincial pension legislation 
substantial cash contributions may be required to fund these benefit plans 
u 
s 
steel contributes to a multiemployer plan domestically for usw represented employees formerly employed by national steel and represented employees hired after may called the steelworkers pension trust spt 
we have legal and contractual requirements for future funding of this plan  which may have a negative effect on our cash flows 
the collective bargaining agreements with the usw entered into effective september  the cbas increased our required contributions to this plan from to per hour 
in addition  funding requirements for participants could increase as a result of any underfunding of this plan 
the turmoil in financial markets during led to significant declines in the value of equity investments that are held by the trusts under our pension plans and the trust to pay for retiree health care and life insurance benefits 
while some of these losses were recovered in and  the losses have contributed to the underfunded position at december  we may be required or may choose to make substantial contributions to these plans 
despite the global recession  domestic health care costs continue to increase each year  and could accelerate due to inflationary pressures on the overall health care trend rates 
these pressures may in part stem from requirements legislated by the patient protection and affordable care act enacted in this will adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow 
many domestic and international competitors do not provide retiree health care and life insurance or defined benefit pension plans  and other international competitors operate in jurisdictions with government sponsored retirement and health care plans that may offer them a cost advantage 
benefit obligations under our plans are not tied to operating rates  therefore  our costs are not expected to decline as a result of the continuing difficult economic conditions or any other future economic downturns 
we have higher environmental remediation costs than our competitors 
this creates a competitive disadvantage and negatively affects our results of operations and cash flows 
u 
s 
steel is involved in numerous remediation projects at currently operating facilities  facilities that have been closed or sold to unrelated parties and other sites where material generated by u 
s 
steel was deposited 
in addition  there are numerous other former operating or disposal sites that could become the subject of remediation 
for example  we recorded a charge of million in in connection with the expanded scope of remediation at our former geneva works bringing the total liability for this site to million as of december  
table of contents environmental remediation costs and related cash requirements of many of our competitors may be substantially less than ours 
many international competitors do not face similar laws in the jurisdictions where they operate 
many us competitors have substantially shorter operating histories than we do  resulting in less exposure for environmental remediation 
competitors that have obtained relief under bankruptcy laws may have been released from certain environmental obligations that existed prior to the bankruptcy filing 
other risk factors applicable to u 
s 
steel unplanned equipment outages and other unforeseen disruptions may reduce our results of operations 
our steel production depends on the operation of critical structures and pieces of equipment  such as blast furnaces  casters  hot strip mills and various structures and operations that support them 
it is possible that we could experience prolonged periods of reduced production and increased maintenance and repair costs due to equipment failures at our facilities or those of our key suppliers 
for example  we experienced a structural failure at gary works in that disrupted operations for several weeks 
it is also possible that operations may be disrupted due to other unforeseen circumstances such as power outages  explosions  fires  floods  accidents and severe weather conditions 
we are also exposed to similar risks involving major customers and suppliers such as force majeure events of raw materials suppliers that have occurred and may occur in the future 
production at usse was curtailed in january due to the suspension of natural gas deliveries to europe from russia transported through ukraine and we remain vulnerable to this risk 
availability of raw materials and delivery of products to customers could be affected by logistical disruptions such as shortages of barges  ocean vessels  rail cars or trucks  or unavailability of rail lines or of locks on the great lakes or other bodies of water 
to the extent that lost production could not be compensated for at unaffected facilities and depending on the length of the outage  our sales and our unit production costs could be adversely affected 
we may be adversely impacted by volatility in prices for raw materials  energy  and steel 
in  approximately percent of u 
s 
steel s flat rolled segment sales in the united states are based on sales contracts with volume commitments and durations of at least one quarter  while lesser percentages of tubular and usse segment sales are made pursuant to such contacts 
these contracts generally have a fixed price or a price that will fluctuate with changes in a defined index and do not always have firm volume commitments 
during periods of rapid escalation of raw materials  energy and other costs such as was experienced in and  u 
s 
steel may not be able to recover these cost increases from customers with existing fixed price agreements 
conversely  some purchase contracts require annual commitments and in periods of rapid decline  such as  u 
s 
steel may be faced with having agreed to purchase raw materials and energy at prices that are above the then current market price or in greater volumes than required 
if steel prices decline  our profit margins on market based indexed contracts and spot business will be reduced 
declines in the production levels of our major customers could have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flow 
our flat rolled and usse segments sell to the automotive  service center  converter  appliance and construction related industries  all of which have been significantly impacted by the ongoing difficult economic conditions 
low demand from customers in these key markets may adversely affect our results of operations 
the terms of our indebtedness contain provisions that may limit our flexibility 
the amended credit agreement is secured by a lien on a majority of our domestic inventory and certain of our accounts receivable and includes a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant that applies when availability under the amended credit agreement is less than million 
because the amended credit agreement was undrawn throughout  this covenant was not applicable  but based on the four quarters ended december   we would not have met this covenant 
the value or levels of inventory may decrease or we may not be able to meet this covenant in the future  and either or both of these situations would limit our ability to borrow under the amended credit agreement 
we also amended our receivables purchase agreement during to increase the maximum amount of receivables eligible for sale to million 
reductions in accounts receivable would limit our ability to sell receivables 

table of contents in general  availability under the amended credit agreement is limited to a monthly borrowing base for certain eligible domestic inventory 
inventory reductions could limit availability to less than the potential million 
if availability under the amended credit agreement falls below the greater of percent of the total aggregate commitments and million  we would also be subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant 
the usss million credit facility and overdraft facility of up to billion serbian dinars which together totaled approximately million at december  also contain a borrowing base limit based upon inventory values 
this may be a particular problem as market conditions and order levels continue to improve and u 
s 
steel needs the liquidity to rebuild working capital 
we have granted the lenders under the amended credit agreement a secured position in our most liquid assets  which may be a detriment to other creditors 
the amended credit agreement  our senior convertible notes issued in and our billion of senior notes issued in and also contain covenants restricting our ability to create liens and engage in sale leasebacks 
additionally  the repayment of amounts outstanding under the amended credit agreement and repurchase of the senior convertible notes and senior notes is required upon a change of control under specified circumstances  as well as other customary provisions 
the amended credit agreement  the senior convertible notes and the rpa have provisions that certain defaults under a material debt obligation could cause a default under the amended credit agreement or the senior convertible notes or termination of the rpa 
these terms may affect our liquidity  our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities 
under the terms of the separation from marathon oil corporation marathon  we are required to provide for the discharge of their obligations under million of environmental revenue bonds 
under the terms of the separation from marathon  we are obligated to provide for the discharge of marathon from any liability under million of environmental revenue bonds by december  if we are not able to arrange for the refinancing of these bonds as our sole obligation  we will be required to pay million  which includes million of call premiums  to call the bonds no later than december  there is no assurance that we will be able to arrange such refinancing or of the terms thereof 
rating agencies may downgrade our credit ratings  which would make it more difficult for us to raise capital and would increase our financial costs 
any downgrades in our credit ratings may make raising capital more difficult  may increase the cost and affect the terms of future borrowings  may affect the terms under which we purchase goods and services and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities 
change in control clauses in our financial and labor agreements grant the other parties to those agreements rights to accelerate obligations and to terminate or extend our labor agreements 
upon the occurrence of change in control events specified in our senior notes  amended credit agreement  senior convertible notes and various other contracts and leases  the holders of our indebtedness may require us to immediately repurchase or repay that debt on less than favorable terms 
additionally  the cbas give the usw the right to either terminate or extend the collective bargaining agreements for an additional four years 
among other things  these provisions may make a takeover of u 
s 
steel more difficult 
a change of control is generally defined to include any of the following a the acquisition by a person or group of at least percent of our common stock  b a merger in which holders of our common stock own less than a majority of the equity in the resulting entity  or c replacement of a majority of the members of our board of directors by persons who were not nominated by our current directors 
our operations expose us to uncertainties and risks in the countries in which we operate  which could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows 
our us operations are subject to economic conditions and political factors in the united states  which if changed could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flow 
political factors include  but are not limited to  taxation  inflation  increased regulation  limitations on exports of energy and raw materials  and trade remedies 

table of contents actions taken by the us government could affect our results of operations and cash flow 
for example  president obama s administration has proposed significant changes to us tax law  such as the elimination of the last in first out lifo inventory costing method  which could negatively affect our profitability and cash flow if they are enacted ussk  located in slovakia  usss  located in serbia  and ussc  located in canada  constitute percent of our global raw steel production capability 
all of them are subject to economic conditions and political factors in the countries in which they are located  and ussk is additionally subject to economic conditions and political factors associated with the eu and the euro currency 
changes in any of these economic conditions or political factors could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flow 
political factors include  but are not limited to  taxation  nationalization  inflation  government instability  civil unrest  increased regulation and quotas  tariffs and other protectionist measures 
any future foreign acquisitions or expansions could expose us to similar risks 
we are subject to significant foreign currency risks  which could negatively impact our profitability and cash flows 
our foreign operations accounted for approximately percent of our net sales in the financial condition and results of operations of ussk  usss and ussc are reported in various foreign currencies and then translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements 
the appreciation of the us dollar against these foreign currencies could have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations 
in addition  international cash requirements have been and in the future may be funded by intercompany loans  creating intercompany monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities involved  which can have a non cash impact on income when they are remeasured at the end of each period 
a billion us dollar denominated intercompany loan from a us subsidiary to a european subsidiary was the primary exposure at december  any future foreign acquisitions or expansions may increase such risks 
our business requires substantial expenditures for debt service  obligations  capital investment  operating leases and maintenance that we may be unable to fund 
with billion of debt outstanding as of december   we have significant debt service requirements 
our operations are capital intensive 
for the five year period ended december   total capital expenditures were billion 
at december   our contractual commitments to acquire property  plant and equipment totaled million and we were obligated to make aggregate lease payments of million under operating leases 
in addition to capital expenditures and lease payments  we spend significant amounts for maintenance of raw material  steelmaking and steel finishing facilities 
as of december   we had contingent obligations consisting of indemnity obligations under active surety bonds  trusts and letters of credit totaling approximately million and contractual purchase commitments  including take or pay arrangements  totalling approximately billion 
our business may not generate sufficient operating cash flow or external financing sources may not be available in amounts sufficient  to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs 
the limitations under our amended credit agreement and rpa  described above  may limit our availability to draw upon these facilities 
we intend to indefinitely reinvest undistributed foreign earnings outside the united states  however  if we need to repatriate funds in the future to satisfy our liquidity needs  the tax consequences would reduce income and cash flow

these agreements also restrict our ability to trade  sell or use foreign produced coke and iron ore in north america  and further require that the ratio of non usw employees to usw employees at our domestic facilities not exceed one to five 
while other domestic integrated unionized steel producers have similar requirements in their agreements with the usw  non union producers are not subject to such requirements 
we are at risk of labor stoppages 
the collective bargaining agreement at the hamilton works expired in july and there has been a work stoppage since november  we are also at risk for work stoppages at other locations as their collective bargaining agreements expire or if unauthorized job actions occur 
there are risks associated with past acquisitions  as well as any acquisitions we may make in the future 
our acquisitions of lone star technologies  inc lone star and stelco  inc stelco created goodwill on our balance sheet which totaled billion as of december   and which exposes us to the risk of future impairment charges 
our flat rolled reporting unit was allocated goodwill from the stelco and lone star acquisitions in and our texas operations reporting unit  which is part of our tubular operating segment  was allocated goodwill from the lone star acquisition 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually in the third quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the estimated fair value of the associated reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
fair value is determined based on consideration of the income  market and cost approaches as applicable in accordance with the guidance in accounting standards codification asc topic if business conditions deteriorate or other factors have an adverse effect on our estimates of discounted future cash flows or compound annual growth rate  future tests of goodwill impairment may result in an impairment charge 
the assumptions used will have a large impact on the conclusions reached in future tests 
as of december   the flat rolled and texas operations reporting units have million and million of goodwill  respectively 
the annual goodwill impairment test showed that the estimated fair values of our flat rolled and texas operations reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately billion and million  respectively 
a basis point increase in the discount rate  a critical assumption in which even a minor change can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  would decrease the fair value of the flat rolled and texas operations reporting units by approximately billion and million  respectively 
the lone star acquisition increased our tubular production capacity by more than percent and the stelco acquisition increased our north american steelmaking capability by percent  thereby increasing our exposure to cyclical downturns in historically cyclical industries such as oil and gas  service center  conversion  automotive  construction and appliance 
the success of any future acquisitions will depend substantially on the accuracy of our analysis concerning such businesses and our ability to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms  to finance such acquisitions and to integrate the acquired operations successfully with existing operations 
if we are unable to integrate new 
table of contents operations successfully  our financial results and business reputation could suffer 
our acquisitions in involved purchase prices significantly higher than the prices we paid for our acquisitions in such prices will make it more difficult to achieve adequate financial returns 
additional risks associated with acquisitions are the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies  the possible assumption of unknown liabilities  potential disputes with the sellers  and the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have limited or no prior experience 
international acquisitions may present unique challenges and increase the company s exposure to the risks associated with foreign operations and countries 
antitrust and other laws in foreign jurisdictions may prevent us from completing acquisitions 
there are risks associated with existing and potential accounting and tax requirements 
we do not recognize a tax benefit for pre tax losses in jurisdictions where we have recorded a full valuation allowance for accounting purposes 
as a result  the pre tax losses associated with usss and ussc do not provide any tax benefit for accounting purposes 
significant changes in the mix of pre tax results among the jurisdictions in which we operate could have a material impact on our effective tax rate 
similarly  our use of intercompany loans has and in the future may have significant impacts on our financial statements as a result of foreign currency accounting remeasurement effects 
potential future accounting changes could negatively affect our profitability and cash flow 
even if the impacts are non cash they may materially impact perceptions and judgments about us by rating agencies and investors 
changes in tax law  such as the elimination of the lifo method of accounting for inventories  could also negatively affect our profitability and cash flow 
we may be subject to litigation  the resolution of which could negatively affect our profitability and cash flow in a particular period 
our profitability or cash flow in a particular period could be affected by an adverse ruling in any litigation currently pending in the courts or by litigation that may be filed against us in the future

steel more difficult 
certain provisions of delaware law  our certificate of incorporation and by laws and our rights plan could make more difficult or delay our acquisition by means of a tender offer  a proxy contest or otherwise and the removal of incumbent directors 
these provisions are intended to discourage certain types of coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids  even though such a transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their stock at a price above the prevailing market price

over the last few years we had intensified our recruitment  training and retention efforts so that we may continue to optimally staff our operations  but we instituted a freeze on hiring in early in response to the global economic recession 
if we are unable to hire sufficient qualified replacements for those leaving  our future performance may be adversely impacted 
with respect to our represented employees  we may be adversely impacted by the loss of employees who retired or obtained other employment during the time they were laid off or subject to a work stoppage such as currently exists at hamilton works 

table of contents we may experience difficulties implementing our enterprise resource planning erp system 
we continue to deploy an erp system at our various locations to help us operate more efficiently 
this is a complex project  which is expected to be implemented in several phases over the next few years 
we may not be able to successfully implement the erp program without experiencing difficulties 
in addition  the expected benefits of implementing the erp system may not be realized or the costs of implementation may outweigh the realized benefits 
we modified the implementation schedule in early to reduce near term costs 
this action will delay the realization of benefits from this project and may add to final project costs

asbestos litigation as of december   u 
s 
steel was a defendant in approximately active cases involving approximately  plaintiffs 
at december   u 
s 
steel was a defendant in approximately active cases involving approximately  plaintiffs 
during  settlements and dismissals resulted in the disposition of approximately claims and u 
s 
steel paid approximately million in settlements 
new filings added approximately claims 
about  or approximately percent  of these claims are currently pending in jurisdictions which permit filings with massive numbers of plaintiffs 
based upon u 
s 
steel s experience in such cases  it believes that the actual number of plaintiffs who ultimately assert claims against u 
s 
steel will likely be a small fraction of the total number of plaintiffs 
most of the claims filed in  and involve individual or small groups of claimants 
historically  these claims against u 
s 
steel fall into three major groups claims made by persons who allegedly were exposed to asbestos at u 
s 
steel facilities referred to as premises claims  claims made by industrial workers allegedly exposed to products formerly manufactured by u 
s 
steel  and claims made under certain federal and general maritime laws by employees of former operations of u 
s 
steel 
the ultimate outcome of any claim depends upon a myriad of legal and factual issues  including whether the plaintiff can prove actual disease  if any  actual exposure  if any  to u 
s 
steel products  the duration of exposure to asbestos  if any  on u 
s 
steel s premises and the plaintiff s exposure to other sources of asbestos 
in general  the only insurance available to u 
s 
steel with respect to asbestos claims is excess casualty insurance  which has multi million dollar self insured retentions 
to date  u 
s 
steel has received minimal payments under these policies relating to asbestos claims 
these asbestos cases allege a variety of respiratory and other diseases based on alleged exposure to asbestos 
u 
s 
steel is currently a defendant in cases in which a total of approximately plaintiffs allege that they are suffering from mesothelioma 
the potential for damages against defendants may be greater in cases in which the plaintiffs can prove mesothelioma 
in many cases in which claims have been asserted against u 
s 
steel  the plaintiffs have been unable to establish any causal relationship to u 
s 
steel or our products or premises  however  with the decline in mass plaintiff cases the incidence of claimants actually alleging a claim against u 
s 
steel is increasing 
in addition  in many asbestos cases  the plaintiffs have been unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any identifiable injury or compensable loss at all  that any injuries that they have incurred did in fact result from alleged exposure to asbestos  or that such alleged exposure was in any way related to u 
s 
steel or our products or premises 
in every asbestos case in which u 
s 
steel is named as a party  the complaints are filed against numerous named defendants and generally do not contain allegations regarding specific monetary damages sought 
to the extent that any specific amount of damages is sought  the amount applies to claims against all named defendants and in no case is there any allegation of monetary damages against u 
s 
steel 
historically  approximately percent of the cases against u 
s 
steel did not specify any damage amount or stated that the damages sought exceeded the amount required to establish jurisdiction of the court in which the case was filed 
jurisdictional amounts generally range from  to  u 
s 
steel does not consider the amount of damages alleged  if any  in a complaint to be relevant in assessing our potential exposure to asbestos liabilities 
u 
s 
steel aggressively pursues grounds for the dismissal of u 
s 
steel from pending cases and litigates cases to verdict where we believe litigation is appropriate 
u 
s 
steel also makes efforts to settle appropriate cases  especially mesothelioma cases  for reasonable  and frequently nominal  amounts 

table of contents the following table shows activity with respect to asbestos litigation year ended december  opening number of claims claims dismissed  settled and resolved new claims closing number of claims amounts paid to resolve claims in millions the amount u 
s 
steel has accrued for pending asbestos claims is not material to u 
s 
steel s financial position 
u 
s 
steel does not accrue for unasserted asbestos claims because it is not possible to determine whether any loss is probable with respect to such claims or even to estimate the amount or range of any possible losses 
the vast majority of pending claims against us allege so called premises liability based exposure on u 
s 
steel s current or former premises 
these claims may be made by an indeterminable number of people such as truck drivers  railroad workers  salespersons  contractors and their employees  government inspectors  customers  visitors and even trespassers 
in most cases  the claimant also was exposed to asbestos in non u 
s 
steel settings  the relative periods of exposure between u 
s 
steel and non u 
s 
steel settings vary with each claimant  and the strength or weakness of the causal link between u 
s 
steel exposure and any injury vary widely as do the nature and severity of the injury claimed 
it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of asbestos related lawsuits  claims and proceedings due to the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation 
despite this uncertainty  management believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  although the resolution of such matters could significantly impact results of operations for a particular period 
among the factors considered in reaching this conclusion are the generally declining trend in the number of claims  that it has been many years since u 
s 
steel employed maritime workers or manufactured or sold asbestos containing products  and u 
s 
steel s history of trial outcomes  settlements and dismissals 
the foregoing statements of belief are forward looking statements

cercla remediation sites claims under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla and related state acts have been raised with respect to the cleanup of various waste disposal and other sites 
cercla is intended to expedite the cleanup of hazardous substances without regard to fault 
potentially responsible parties prps for each site include present and former owners and operators of  transporters to and generators of the substances at the site 
liability is strict and can be joint and several 
because of various factors including the ambiguity of the regulations  the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site  the complexity of determining the relative liability among them  the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred  it is impossible to reasonably estimate u 
s 
steel s ultimate cost of compliance with cercla 
projections  provided in the following paragraphs  of spending for and or timing of completion of specific projects are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are based on certain assumptions including  but not limited to  the factors provided in the preceding paragraph 
to the extent that these assumptions prove to be inaccurate  future spending for  or timing of completion of  environmental projects may differ materially from what was stated in forward looking statements 

table of contents at december   u 
s 
steel had been identified as a prp at a total of cercla sites where liability is not resolved 
based on currently available information  which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete  management believes that u 
s 
steel s liability for cleanup and remediation costs will be between million and million for of these sites  will be between  and million per site for of these sites  and will be under  per site for of these sites 
at other sites  management estimates u 
s 
steel s share in the future cleanup costs to be million  although it is not possible to accurately predict the amount of final allocation of such costs 
one site is known as the municipal industrial disposal co 
site in elizabeth  pennsylvania

the other site is the former duluth works  which was listed by the minnesota pollution control agency mpca under the minnesota environmental response and liability act on its permanent list of priorities 
the us environmental protection agency epa has included the duluth works site with the st 
louis river interlake duluth tar site on epa s national priorities list 
the duluth works cleanup has proceeded since u

steel has prepared a conceptual habitat enhancement plan hep that includes measures to address contaminated sediments in the st 
louis river estuary 
mpca on behalf of epa has completed its second five year review for the site 
as a result  additional data collection will be required to address data gaps identified in the five year review and corrective measures will be required to address the recently discovered areas of contamination on the upland property 
study  investigation and oversight costs along with implementation of corrective measures on the upland property and implementation of the hep are currently estimated at million 
in addition  there are sites related to u 
s 
steel where information requests have been received or there are other indications that u 
s 
steel may be a prp under cercla  but where sufficient information is not presently available to confirm the existence of liability or to make any judgment as to the amount thereof 
other remediation activities there are additional sites where remediation is being sought under other environmental statutes  both federal and state  or where private parties are seeking remediation through discussions or litigation 
based on currently available information  which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete  management believes that liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with of these sites will be under  per site  another sites have potential costs between  and million per site  and sites may involve remediation costs between million and million per site

steel are general economic conditions in north america  europe and  to a lesser extent  other steel consuming regions  the levels of worldwide steel production and consumption  pension and other benefits costs  and raw material iron ore  coal  coke  steel scrap  zinc  tin and other metallic additions and energy natural gas and electricity costs 
following several years of strong performance  the steel industry and u 
s 
steel were quickly and severely affected in the latter part of by the global recession 
in response to these economic conditions  our strategy has been to enhance or maintain our liquidity  maintain a solid balance sheet  focus capital investments on key projects of long term strategic importance and position ourselves for success in the longer term 
in late and early  we idled all or portions of numerous steel making  finishing  raw materials and tubular operations in the us  canada and europe and operated our remaining facilities at reduced levels to match our customers lower demand requirements 
in response to the gradual economic recovery that appears to be underway in north america and europe  in the first half of we restarted all of our operations that were temporarily idled 
our hamilton works iron and steelmaking facilities are idled as a result of a labor stoppage that occurred on november  and is continuing 
we continue to monitor the impact of the economic situation on our customers and to adjust our operations to efficiently meet their requirements 
our raw steel capability utilization rate in was for flat rolled operations and for usse operations 
u 
s 
steel s long term success depends on our ability to earn a competitive return on capital employed by implementing our strategy to be a world leader in safety and environmental performance  to continue to increase our value added product mix  to further expand our global business platform  to maintain a strong capital structure  balance sheet and liquidity position  to continue to improve our reliability and cost competitiveness  and to attract and retain a diverse and talented workforce 
for a fuller description of our strategy  see item business description business strategy 
some of the other key issues which are impacting the global steel industry  including u 
s 
steel  are the level of unfunded pension and other benefits obligations  the degree of industry consolidation  the impact of production and consumption of steel in china and other developing countries  and the levels of steel imports into the markets we serve 

table of contents critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of u 
s 
steel s financial condition and results of operations is based upon u 
s 
steel s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the year 
management regularly evaluates these estimates  including those related to employee benefits liabilities and assets held in trust relating to such liabilities  the carrying value of property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets  valuation allowances for receivables  inventories and deferred income tax assets  liabilities for deferred income taxes  potential tax deficiencies  environmental obligations and potential litigation claims and settlements 
management s estimates are based on historical experience  current business and market conditions  and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from current expectations under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
inventories inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
lifo last in  first out is the predominant method of inventory costing for inventories in the united states and fifo first in  first out is the predominant method used in canada and europe 
the lifo method of inventory costing was used for percent and percent of consolidated inventories at december  and december   respectively 
changes in us gaap rules or tax law  such as the elimination of the lifo method of accounting for inventories  could negatively affect our profitability and cash flow 
equity method investments investments in entities over which u 
s 
steel has significant influence are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are carried at u 
s 
steel s share of net assets plus loans  advances and our share of earnings less distributions 
differences in the basis of the investment and the underlying net asset value of the investee  if any  are amortized into earnings over the remaining useful life of the associated assets 
income from investees includes u 
s 
steel s share of income from equity method investments  which is generally recorded a month in arrears  except for significant and unusual items which are recorded in the period of occurrence 
gains or losses from changes in ownership of unconsolidated investees are recognized in the period of change 
intercompany profits and losses on transactions with equity investees have been eliminated in consolidation subject to lower of cost or market inventory adjustments 
u 
s 
steel evaluates impairment of its equity method investments whenever circumstances indicate that a decline in value below carrying value is other than temporary 
under these circumstances  we would adjust the investment down to its estimated fair value  which then becomes its new carrying value 
pensions and other benefits the recording of net periodic benefit costs for defined benefit pensions and other benefits is based on  among other things  assumptions of the expected annual return on plan assets  discount rate  escalation or other changes in retiree health care costs and plan participation levels 
changes in the assumptions or differences between actual and expected changes in the present value of liabilities or assets of u 
s 
steel s plans could cause net periodic benefit costs to increase or decrease materially from year to year as discussed below 
u 
s 
steel s investment strategy for its us pension and other benefits plan assets provides for a diversified mix of large and mid cap equities  high quality bonds and selected smaller investments in private equities  investment trusts  timber and mineral interests 
for its us pension plans  u 
s 
steel has a target allocation for plan assets of percent equities with the balance primarily invested in corporate bonds and government backed bonds and treasury bills 
for the other benefit plans  the target allocation for plan assets is percent equities 
u 
s 
steel 
table of contents also believes that returns on equities over the long term will be higher than returns from fixed income securities as actual historical returns from u 
s 
steel s trusts have shown 
returns on bonds tend to offset some of the shorter term volatility of stocks 
both equity and fixed income investments are made across a broad range of industries and companies to provide protection against the impact of volatility in any single industry as well as company specific developments 
u 
s 
steel is currently using an percent assumed rate of return for purposes of the expected return on assets for the development of net periodic cost for the main defined benefit pension plan and other benefits 
this rate was chosen by taking into account the intended asset mix and the historical premiums that fixed income and equity investments have yielded above government bonds 
actual returns since the inception of the plans have exceeded this percent rate and while annual returns were below this level  and have returned to this level and it is u 
s 
steel s expectation that future periods will approximate this rate 
for canadian defined benefit pension plans  u 
s 
steel s investment strategy is similar to its strategy for us plans  whereby the company seeks a diversified mix of large and mid cap equities  high quality corporate and government bonds and selected smaller investments with a target allocation for plan assets of percent equities 
a percent rate of return is being used for the development of net periodic costs in which is lower than the us pension plan assumption as subcategories within the asset mix are from a more limited investment universe and  as a result  have a lower expected return 
at december   u 
s 
steel decreased the discount rate used to measure both domestic pension and other benefits obligations to percent from percent 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which we estimate the pension and other benefits liabilities could be effectively settled at the measurement date 
in setting the domestic rates  we utilize several aaa and aa corporate bond indices as an indication of interest rate movements and levels  and we also look to an internally calculated rate determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments from a stream of aa or higher rated zero coupon corporate bonds theoretically available in the marketplace 
for canadian benefit plans  a discount rate was selected through a similar review process using canadian bond rates and indices and at december   u 
s 
steel decreased the discount rate to percent from percent for its canadian based pension and other benefits 
u 
s 
steel reviews its own actual historical rate experience and expectations of future insurance trends to determine the escalation of per capita health care costs under u 
s 
steel s insurance plans 
about two thirds of our costs for the domestic usw participants retiree health benefits in the company s main domestic insurance plan are limited to a per capita dollar maximum calculation based on base year actual costs incurred under the main u 
s 
steel insurance plan for usw participants the cost cap that was negotiated in the effective date of the cost cap was deferred under the cba until after  the company s costs for a majority of usw retirees and their beneficiaries are expected to remain fixed with the application of the cost cap and as a result  the cost impact of health care escalation on the company is projected to be limited for this group see footnote to the financial statements 
for measurement of its domestic retiree medical plans where health care cost escalation is applicable  u 
s 
steel has assumed an initial escalation rate of percent for this rate is assumed to decrease gradually to an ultimate rate of percent in and remain at that level thereafter 
for measurement of its canadian retiree medical plans  u 
s 
steel has assumed an initial escalation rate of percent for this rate is assumed to decrease gradually to an ultimate rate of percent in and remain at that level thereafter 
net periodic pension cost  including multiemployer plans  is expected to total approximately million in compared to million in the increase in expected expense in is primarily related to lower expected asset returns and higher amortization of actuarial losses caused by a lower market related value of assets from the recognition of remaining equity losses from total other benefits costs in are expected to be approximately million  compared to million in 
table of contents a sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical percentage point change in the significant assumptions used in the pension and other benefits calculations is provided in the following table hypothetical rate increase decrease in millions of dollars expected return on plan assets incremental increase decrease in net periodic pension cost for discount rate incremental increase decrease in net periodic pension other benefits costs for pension other benefits liabilities at december  health care cost escalation trend rates incremental increase decrease in service and interest cost components for changes in the assumptions for expected annual return on plan assets and the discount rate do not impact the funding calculations used to derive minimum funding requirements for the pension plans 
for further cash flow discussion see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition  cash flows and liquidity liquidity 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of acquired identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed from businesses acquired 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually in the third quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the estimated fair value of the associated reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we have two reporting units that have a significant amount of goodwill 
our flat rolled reporting unit was allocated goodwill from the stelco  inc stelco and lone star technologies  inc 
lone star acquisitions in these amounts reflect the benefits we expect the flat rolled reporting unit to realize from expanding our flexibility in meeting our customers needs and running our flat rolled facilities at higher operating rates to source our semi finished product needs 
our texas operations reporting unit  which is part of our tubular operating segment  was allocated goodwill from the lone star acquisition  reflecting the benefits we expect the reporting unit to realize from the expansion of our tubular operations 
u 
s 
steel completed its annual goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of and determined that there was no goodwill impairment for either reporting unit 
fair value was determined in accordance with the guidance in accounting standards codification asc topic on fair value  which requires consideration of the income  market and cost approaches as applicable 
for the annual goodwill impairment test  u 
s 
steel used fair values estimated under the income approach and the market approach 
u 
s 
steel did not utilize the cost approach as relevant data was not available 
the income approach is based upon projected future cash flows discounted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk associated with the future cash flows 
fair value for the flat rolled and texas operations reporting units was estimated using probability weighted scenarios of future cash flow projections based on management s long range estimates of market conditions over a multiple year horizon 
a three percent perpetual growth rate was used to arrive at an estimated future terminal value 
a discount rate of percent was used for both reporting units  which was based upon the cost of capital of other comparable steel companies  which we view as the most likely market participants  as of the date of our goodwill impairment test 
the market approach is based upon an analysis of valuation metrics for companies comparable to our reporting units 
fair value for the flat rolled and texas operations reporting units was estimated using an appropriate valuation multiple based on this analysis  estimated normalized earnings and an estimated control premium 

table of contents in order to validate the reasonableness of the estimated fair values of our reporting units  a reconciliation of the aggregate fair values of all reporting units to market capitalization  using a reasonable control premium  was performed as of the valuation date 
we further validated the reasonableness of the estimated fair values of our reporting units using other valuation metrics that included data from u 
s 
steel s historical transactions as well as published industry analyst reports 
the estimates of fair value of a reporting unit under the income approach are determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
a discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions  including assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash flows  growth rates and discount rates 
if business conditions deteriorate or other factors have an adverse effect on our estimates of discounted future cash flows or assumed growth rates  or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization  future tests of goodwill impairment may result in an impairment charge 
as of december   the flat rolled and texas operations reporting units have million and million of goodwill  respectively 
after weighting the income and market approaches  the annual goodwill impairment test showed that the estimated fair values of our flat rolled and texas operations reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately billion and million  respectively 
a basis point increase in the discount rate  a critical assumption in which even a minor change can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  would decrease the fair value of the flat rolled and texas operations reporting units by approximately billion and million  respectively  but would still not result in a goodwill impairment charge 
u 
s 
steel has determined that certain acquired intangible assets have indefinite useful lives 
these assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
long lived assets u 
s 
steel evaluates long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of those productive assets exceed their projected undiscounted cash flows 
we evaluate the impairment of long lived assets at the asset group level 
taxes u 
s 
steel records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
a full valuation allowance is recorded for both our canadian and serbian deferred tax assets primarily due to cumulative losses in these jurisdictions in recent years 
accordingly  losses in canada and serbia do not generate a tax benefit for accounting purposes 
in the event that u 
s 
steel determines that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should u 
s 
steel determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
u 
s 
steel expects to generate future taxable income to realize the benefits of our net deferred tax assets 
u 
s 
steel makes no provision for deferred us income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings because as of december   it remained management s intention to continue to indefinitely reinvest such earnings in foreign operations 
see note to the financial statements 
undistributed foreign earnings at december  amounted to approximately  million 
if such earnings were not indefinitely reinvested  a us deferred tax liability of approximately million would have been required 
u 
s 
steel records liabilities for potential tax deficiencies 
these liabilities are based on management s judgment of the risk of loss for items that have been or may be challenged by taxing authorities 
in the event that u 
s 
steel were to determine that tax related items would not be considered deficiencies or that items previously not considered to be potential deficiencies could be considered potential tax deficiencies as a result of an audit  court case  tax ruling or other authoritative tax position  an adjustment to the liability would be recorded through income in the period such determination was made 

table of contents environmental remediation u 
s 
steel provides for remediation costs and penalties when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable 
remediation liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental exposures and are discounted in certain instances 
u 
s 
steel regularly monitors the progress of environmental remediation 
should studies indicate that the cost of remediation is to be more than previously estimated  an additional accrual would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made 
as of december   the total accrual for environmental remediation was million  excluding liabilities related to asset retirement obligations 
due to uncertainties inherent in remediation projects  it is possible that total remediation costs for active matters may exceed the accrued liability by as much as to percent
