item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  judgment and assumptions 
you should review the risk factors section of this annual report on form k for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
overview metropolitan health networks  inc metropolitan is a for profit corporation incorporated under the laws of florida 
we operate a provider services network the psn  through which we provide and arrange for medical care primarily to medicare advantage beneficiaries in the state of florida who have enrolled in health plans primarily operated by humana  inc humana  or its subsidiaries  one of the largest participants in the medicare advantage program in the united states 
we operate the psn through our wholly owned subsidiary  metcare of florida  inc as of december   the psn operated in florida counties and provided healthcare benefits to approximately  medicare advantage beneficiaries and primary care physician services to several thousand non humana participating customers 
our results are impacted by many factors  but most notably are influenced by our ability to establish and maintain a competitive and efficient cost structure and to accurately and consistently negotiate competitive payments from humana 
benefit costs may be subject to a high rate of inflation due to many forces  including new higher priced technologies and medical procedures  new prescription drugs and therapies  an aging population  lifestyle challenges including obesity and smoking  the tort liability system  and government regulation 
we rely on a key statistical performance measure  the medical expense ratio mer  which is computed by taking total medical expense as a percentage of revenue 
this measure represents a statistic used to measure gross profit 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
as disclosed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements 
actual results may ultimately differ materially from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  including those that are perceived to be the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require complex and or subjective judgments by management 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies include use of estimates  revenue  expense and receivables 
use of estimates  revenue  expense and receivables our revenue is primarily derived from risk based health insurance arrangements in which a monthly per customer capitation fee is paid to us  which fee varies depending on the county  age and severity of illness of the humana participating customer 
we assume the economic risk of funding our customers healthcare services and related administrative costs 
capitation fee revenue is recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive healthcare services 
because we have the obligation to fund medical expenses  we recognize gross revenue and medical expenses associated with the humana agreements in our consolidated financial statements 
periodically we receive retroactive adjustments to the capitation fees paid to us based on the updated health status of our customers known as a medicare risk adjustment or mra score 
the factors considered in this update include changes in demographic factors  risk adjustment scores  customer information and adjustments required by the risk sharing requirements for prescription drug benefits under part d of the medicare program 
in addition  the number of customers for whom we receive capitation fees may be retroactively adjusted due to enrollment changes not yet processed  or not yet reported 
these retroactive adjustments could  in the near term  materially impact the revenue that has been recorded 
we record any adjustments to revenue at the time that the information necessary to make the determination of the adjustment is available and the collectibility of the amount is reasonably assured  or the likelihood of repayment is probable 
medical expenses are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include an estimate of our obligations for medical services that have been provided to our customers but for which we have neither received nor processed claims  and for liabilities for physician  hospital and other medical expense disputes 
we develop our estimated medical claims payable by using an actuarial process that is consistently applied 
the actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt  claim backlogs  care provider contract rate changes  medical care consumption and other medical expense trends 
the actuarial process and models develop a range of projected medical claims payable and we record to the amount within the range that is our best estimate of the ultimate liability 
the actual liability incurred could differ materially from the amount recorded 
each period we re examine previously established medical claims payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances 
as the estimate of medical claims payable recorded in prior periods become more exact  we adjust the amount of our liability estimates  and include the changes in such estimates in medical expense in the period in which the change is identified 
in each reporting period  our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical expense payable estimates associated with previously reported periods 
while we believe our medical expenses payable is adequate to cover future claims payments required  such estimates are based on claims experience to date and various assumptions 
therefore  the actual liability could differ materially from the amounts recorded 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements and item a risk factors a failure to estimate incurred but not reported pending adoption of an accounting pronouncement in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an amendment to the fasb financial accounting standards codification that requires the cost of malpractice claims or similar contingent liabilities shall no longer be presented net of anticipated insurance recoveries 
an entity that is indemnified for these liabilities shall recognize an insurance receivable at the same time that it recognizes the liability  measured on the same basis as the liability  subject to the need for a valuation allowance for uncollectible amounts 
the amendment also discusses the accounting for insurance claims costs  including estimates of costs relating to incurred but not reported claims and the accounting for loss contingencies 
the amendment was effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning in the first quarter of this amendment will have no effect on the method we use to estimate these liabilities 
the amendment will require us to reflect as a liability amounts that may be payable for malpractice costs or similar contingent liabilities 
in addition  we will record a receivable for the expected insurance recovery related to these liabilities 
at december   we believe that all such liabilities will be covered by insurance 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
contractual obligations and other contractual commitments the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments  including the new corporate office lease  as of december  payment due by period contractual less than more than obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations service agreements employment obligations as of december   our long term debt totaled  including current portion and we had no payment obligations that would constitute capital lease obligations 
on january   we entered into a two year service provider agreement to provide software and analysis that will allow us to better manage the care of our customers 
the contract fee is approximate  annually 
impact of inflation in september  cms announced that medicare program spending is projected to increase by in cms also projects that the medicare spending growth rate from to will increase by an average of 
the principal projected drivers for this growth include continued cost increasing medical innovation  inflation  continued strong demand for prescription drugs and the aging baby boomer demographic 
comparison of and summary net income in was million compared to million in  an increase of million or 
the increase in net income was primarily a result of a increase in our per customer per month pcpm revenue  and a decrease in our pcpm medical expense of  which was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses 
basic earnings per share were in compared to in diluted earnings per share were in compared to in the increase in earnings per share in was primarily a result of our increased net income and a reduction of million basic weighted average shares outstanding and million diluted weighted average shares outstanding in as compared to revenue increased to million in from million in  an increase of million or 
the increase in revenue is primarily attributable to an increase in the average risk scores of the customers we serve 
we believe this increase primarily reflects our continuing efforts to assure that our customers are properly diagnosed and assigned the appropriate medicare risk score 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction in the premium rate paid by cms to medicare advantage plans effective january  and a reduction in the number of customer months for the year 
total medical expense for was million compared to million for  a decrease of approximately million or 
pcpm medical costs decreased the decrease in pcpm medical costs is attributable to a number of factors  including certain plan design changes made by humana in selected markets to increase customer co pays and deductibles and modify certain benefits 
such changes were primarily a response to the cms premium reduction and expected utilization and cost increases 
in addition  certain high cost special needs plans were eliminated in january which reduced both our medical costs and our revenue 
we also believe that we are seeing the results of the adoption of the pcmh model of customer care in our owned offices as well as our continued efforts to improve medical care to our customers so they receive the appropriate level of medical care at the appropriate time 
our gross profit was million in as compared to million in  an increase of million or 
our medical expense ratio mer  which is computed by dividing total medical expense by revenue  was in compared to in the decrease in mer is a result of our increased revenue and lower medical costs 
operating expenses increased to million in as compared to million in  an increase of million or 
the increase in operating expenses is primarily due to an increase in payroll  payroll taxes and benefits of million and an increase in general and administrative expense of million 
income before income taxes in was million compared to of million in the increase in the income before income taxes between the periods is primarily a result of the increased gross profit discussed above reduced primarily by the increase in our operating expenses

risk factors for further discussion of the most significant risks that affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
customer information the table set forth below provides i the total number of customers to whom we were providing healthcare services as of december  and and ii the aggregate customer months for and customer months are the aggregate number of months of healthcare services we have provided to customers during a period of time 
customers at december customer months in percentage decrease in customer months between years the decrease in total customer months for as compared to is primarily a result of the net effect of the elimination of certain high cost special needs plans  new enrollments and disenrollments  deaths  customers moving from the covered areas  customers transferring to another physician practice or customers making other insurance selections 
at february   the psn was providing services to approximately  humana participating customers 
revenue the following table provides a breakdown of our sources of revenue 
year ended december increase change psn revenue from humana psn fee for service revenue total psn revenue revenue pcpm member months in  the increase in our pcpm revenue resulted primarily from an increase in the medicare risk score of our customers and was partially offset by a cms premium rate reduction in the psn s most significant source of revenue during both and was the capitation fee revenue generated pursuant to the humana agreements the humana related revenue 
the humana related revenue increased from million in to million in  an increase of approximately million or 
periodically  we receive retroactive adjustments to the capitation fees paid to us based on the updated mra scores of our customers 
the factors considered in this update include changes in demographic factors  risk adjustment scores and customer information 
in addition  the number of customers for whom we receive capitation fees may be retroactively adjusted due to enrollment changes not yet processed or reported 
these retroactive adjustments could  in the near term  materially impact the revenue that has been recorded 
we record any adjustments to this revenue at the time the information necessary to make the determination of the adjustment is available  and either the collectibility of the amount is reasonably assured  or the likelihood of repayment is probable 
at december   we recorded a million receivable representing our estimate of the retroactive mra capitation fee for services provided in that we expect to receive in the summer of in  we received the final retroactive mra capitation fee payment for services provided in the amount received was not materially different then the million receivable that was included in the due to humana at december  at december   we had recorded a million estimated retroactive mra capitation fee receivable for services provided in and received million in the difference of  reduced revenue in we continue to invest resources in people and processes to assure that our customers are assigned the proper risk scores 
these processes include ongoing training of medical staff responsible for coding and routine auditing of customer charts to assure risk coding compliance 
customers with higher risk codes generally require more healthcare resources than those with lower risk codes 
proper coding helps to assure that we receive a capitation fee consistent with the cost of treating these customers 
our efforts related to coding compliance are ongoing and we continue to commit additional resources to this important discipline 
the payment we receive for providing prescription drug benefits the medicare part d payment is subject to adjustment  positive or negative  based upon the application of risk corridors that compare the estimated prescription drug benefit costs the estimated costs to actual incurred prescription drug benefit costs the actual costs 
to the extent the actual costs exceed the estimated costs by more than the risk corridor  we may receive additional payments 
conversely  to the extent the estimated costs exceed the actual costs by more than the risk corridor  we may be required to refund a portion of the medicare part d payment 
the final settlement for the part d program occurs in the subsequent year 
at december   we recorded a receivable of  for the amount we estimate the part d actual costs will exceed part d revenue 
at december   we recorded a receivable of  the amount we estimated part d actual costs would exceed the part d revenue received 
the amount settled in at the approximate amount that was estimated 
the fee for service revenue represents amounts earned from medical services provided to non humana participating customers in our owned physician practices 
total medical expense total medical expense represents the estimated total cost of providing medical care and is comprised of two components  medical claims expense and medical center costs 
medical claims expense is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of our obligations for medical services that have been provided to our customers but for which we have neither received nor processed claims  and for liabilities for physician  hospital and other medical expense disputes 
medical claims expense includes such costs as inpatient and outpatient services  pharmacy benefits and physician services by providers other than the physician practices owned by the psn collectively non affiliated providers 
medical center costs represent the operating costs of the physician practices owned by the psn 
we develop our estimated medical expenses payable by using an actuarial process that is consistently applied 
the actuarial process develops a range of estimated medical expenses payable and we record the amount in the range that is our best estimate of the ultimate liability 
each period  we re examine previously recorded medical claims payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances 
as medical claims expenses recorded in prior periods becomes more exact  we adjust the amount of the estimate  and include the change in medical expense in the period in which the change is identified 
in each reporting period  our operating results include a change in medical expense from the effects of more completely developed medical expense payable estimates associated with previously reported periods 
while we believe our estimated medical expenses payable is adequate to cover future claims payments required  such estimates are based on our claims experience to date and various management assumptions 
therefore  the actual liability could differ materially from the amount recorded 
total medical expense and mer are as follows year ended december  estimated medical expense for the year  excluding prior period claims development favorable unfavorable prior period medical claims development in current year based on actual claims submitted total reported medical expense for the year reported medical expense ratio for year medical expense pcpm in the table above  favorable adjustments to amounts we recorded in prior periods for estimated claims payable appear in parentheses while unfavorable adjustments do not appear in parentheses 
favorable adjustments reduce total medical expense for the respective applicable period and unfavorable claims development increases total medical expense for the applicable period 
the reported mer is impacted by both revenue and expense 
periodically we receive retroactive adjustments to the capitation fees paid to us 
retroactive adjustments of prior periods capitation fees that are recorded in the current period impact the mer of that period 
if the retroactive adjustment increases revenue then the impact reduces the mer for the period 
conversely  if the retroactive adjustment reduces revenue  then the mer for the period is higher 
these retroactive adjustments include  among other things  the mid year and annual mra capitation fee adjustments and settlement of part d program capitation fees 
in addition  actual medical claims expense usually develops differently than estimated during the period 
favorable claims development is a result of actual medical claim cost for prior periods developing lower than the original estimated cost which reduces the reported medical expense and the mer for the current period 
unfavorable claims development is a result of actual medical claim cost for prior periods exceeding the original estimated cost which increases total reported medical expense and the mer for the current period 
because the humana agreements provide that the psn is financially responsible for all medical services provided to the humana participating customers  medical claims expense includes the cost of medical services provided to humana participating customers by non affiliated providers 
the decrease in total medical expense in was primarily due to a decrease in utilization of medical services and  to a lesser extent  the decrease in the number of customer months 
approximately million or of our total medical expense in is attributable to medical claims expense 
in  approximately million or of our total medical expenses were attributable to medical claims expense 
the balance was the expenses associated with operating our medical centers 
medical center costs include the salaries  taxes and benefits of the psn s employed health professionals and staff providing primary care services  as well as the costs associated with the operations of those practices 
approximately million of our total medical expenses in related to physician practices we own as compared to million in the increase is due primarily to an office acquired in july and an increase in our offices staff and additional technology costs as we transition to a pcmh model of care and implement an electronic medical record system 
our pcpm medical expense decreased from in to in despite medical cost inflation  we believe that pcpm medical costs decreased in  as compared to  due to  among other things  certain plan design changes made by humana in selected markets to increase customer co pays and deductibles and modify certain benefits  the elimination of certain high cost special needs plans in certain of our counties  and the continued efforts of our medical management team to assure that proper medical care is provided to our customers 
the increase in revenue and reduction in medical costs resulted in a decrease in our mer  from in to in a number of factors impacting both revenue and medical expense that are discussed in this management s discussion and analysis have positively impacted our mer in although we continue to develop and execute programs and initiatives that we believe will positively impact both revenue and medical expense  there is no assurance that we will be able to maintain our mer at this historically low level 
a change in either revenue or medical claims expense of approximately million would have impacted the mer by in while a change in either revenue or medical claims expense of approximately million would have impacted our mer by in at december   we determined that the range for estimated medical claims payable was between million and million and we recorded a liability of million  the actuarial mid point of the range 
based on historical results  we believe that the actuarial mid point of the range continues to be the best estimate within the range of the psn s ultimate liability 
other operating expenses the following table provides information regarding the various items which comprise other operating expenses 
year ended december decrease increase change payroll  payroll taxes and benefits percentage of total revenue general and administrative percentage of total revenue marketing and advertising percentage of total revenue total other operating expenses payroll  payroll taxes and benefits payroll  payroll taxes and benefits include salary and related costs associated with our corporate level executive and administrative costs 
the increase in is primarily a result of an increase in the amount accrued for employee bonuses for resulting from improved earnings  an increase in stock based compensation expense and an increase in salary costs associated with the implementation of our pcmh model of care and the installation of electronic medical records in our practices 
general and administrative this increase in general and administrative expense was primarily a result of an increase in the fees of an outside entity to review our risk score coding compliance and an increase in director fees related to the early vesting of stock based compensation of the directors that resigned in april marketing and advertising marketing and advertising costs did not increase significantly in from we believe that our marketing and advertising expense will increase in the future 
gain on sale of hmo subsidiary during  we finalized the net statutory equity settlement related to the sale of the hmo and recognized an additional gain of  the final settlement was paid to us in april the gain on sale in of million includes additional gain from the closing net equity settlement for the hmo and the settlement of certain liabilities of the hmo that we settled in at amounts lower than the liability recorded at august  other income we realized other income of  in compared to  in investment income  which includes realized and unrealized gains and losses was  in as compared to  in investment income is included in other income 
realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio were  in compared to realized and unrealized gains of  in income taxes our effective income tax rate was in and in comparison of and summary net income in was million compared to million in  an increase of million or 
the increase in net income was primarily a result of a increase in pcpm revenue and an increase in customer months partially offset by an increase in pcpm medical expense of basic earnings per share were in and in diluted earnings per share were in compared to in the increase in earnings per share was primarily a result of our increased net income and the impact of our share buyback program that began in october which reduced basic weighted average shares outstanding by million shares and diluted weighted average shares outstanding by million in from by million shares 
the gain on the sale of the hmo  net of the related stay bonuses and termination costs in  increased net income in by per basic and diluted share and by per basic and diluted share in our customer months  which are the aggregate number of months of healthcare services we have provided to customers during a period of time  increased to  in from  in  an increase of revenue increased to million in from million in  an increase of million or 
the pcpm revenue increase in is primarily a result of a cms premium rate increase of and an increase in the average medicare risk score of our customers 
total medical expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in total medical expense in was primarily due to the increase in the number of customer months and increasing medical costs 
our gross profit increased from million in to million in  an increase of million or

revenue the following table provides a breakdown of our sources of revenue year ended december  increase decrease change psn revenue from humana psn fee for service revenue total psn revenue percentage of total revenue hmo revenue percentage of total revenue total revenue revenue pcpm the pcpm revenue increase in is primarily a result of a cms premium rate increase of and an increase in the average medicare risk score of our customers 
the increase in pcpm revenue in was reduced by the ipa agreement entered into as a result of the sale of the hmo 
more specifically  while we owned the hmo in  we received of the premium paid by cms for the hmo s customers 
since the sale of the hmo  we receive  pursuant to the ipa agreement  less than of the cms premium paid to humana with respect to customers in the hmo s former counties of operation 
the psn s most significant source of revenue during both and was the capitation fee revenue generated pursuant to the humana agreements the humana related revenue 
the humana related revenue increased from million in to million in  an increase of million or 
approximately million of the increase in the is attributable to the ipa agreement pursuant to which we began providing services to the customers of the hmo following its sale to the humana plan 
the balance of the increase is primarily attributable to a increase in our pcpm capitation fee in as compared to and the increase in our customer base 
at december   we recorded a million receivable representing our estimate of the retroactive mra capitation fee for services provided in that we expect to receive in the summer of in  we received the final mra capitation fee payment for services provided in in the amount of million 
at december   we had recorded a million estimated mra receivable for services provided in the difference of  reduced revenue in the final retroactive mra capitation fee adjustment for services provided in  which was received in  was not materially different than the estimate we recorded at december  at december  we recorded a receivable of  the amount we estimate part d actual costs exceeded the part d revenue received 
at december   we estimated that we would be required to refund  related to medicare part d payments received and recorded a liability for this amount 
the amount settled at the approximate amount that was estimated 
in  we determined that the final part d settlement payable for prescription drug coverage in was over accrued by approximately million and increased revenue in by this amount 
the fee for service revenue represents amounts earned from medical services provided to non humana participating customers in our owned physician practices

favorable adjustments reduce total medical expense for the respective applicable period and unfavorable claims development increases total medical expense for the applicable period 
the increase in total medical expense in was primarily due to the increase in the number of customer months and increasing medical costs 
approximately million or of our total medical expenses in are attributable to medical claims expense 
in  approximately million or of our total medical expenses were attributable to medical claims expense 
the balance is expenses associated with operating our medical centers

based on historical results  we believe that the actuarial mid point of the range continues to be the best estimate within the range of the psn s ultimate liability 
other operating expenses the following table provides information regarding the various items which comprise other operating expenses 
year ended december decrease increase change payroll  payroll taxes and benefits percentage of total revenue general and administrative percentage of total revenue marketing and advertising percentage of total revenue stay bonuses and termination costs percentage of total revenue total other operating expenses payroll  payroll taxes and benefits payroll  payroll taxes and benefits include salaries and related costs for our executive  administrative and the sales staff of the hmo in the decrease in administrative payroll  payroll taxes and benefits is primarily a result of a million decrease in payroll cost associated with the hmo following the sale of the hmo primarily offset by the costs related to the amount expensed under the amended employment agreement of our ceo 
general and administrative general and administrative expense associated with the hmo decreased million as a result of the sale of the hmo partially offset by increased costs of the psn associated with the number of customers cared for under the ipa agreement 
marketing and advertising marketing and advertising expense primarily consists of advertising expenses and  in  brokerage commissions paid to independent sales agents of the hmo 
the primary reason for the decrease in marketing and advertising costs in is the elimination of these costs upon the sale of the hmo as a significant portion of our marketing costs were incurred during the open enrollment period  which occurred in the first and last quarter of the year 
stay bonuses and termination costs in connection with the sale of the hmo  we paid certain employees of the hmo stay bonuses and termination payments 
we recognized and paid all of these costs in the third quarter of we incurred no such costs in gain on sale of hmo subsidiary on august   we completed the sale of all of the outstanding capital stock of our hmo to the humana plan for a cash purchase price of approximately million 
we recognized a gain on the sale of the hmo in the third quarter of of approximately million 
the gain on sale in of million includes additional gain from the closing net equity settlement for the hmo and the settlement of certain liabilities of the hmo that we settled in at amounts lower than the liability recorded at august  other income we realized other income of  in compared to  in investment income was  in as compared to  in  and is included in other income 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was in and in the decrease in was a result of an increase in our investment in tax exempt securities 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  totaled approximately million as compared to approximately million at december  this increase is primarily a result of cash provided by operating activities and was partially offset by the million of cash used for the repurchase of our common stock 
as of december   we had working capital of approximately million as compared to working capital of approximately million at december   an increase of approximately million or 
this increase in working capital is primarily attributable to an increase in our short term investments and an increase in the due from humana 
we have an investment policy with respect to the investment of our cash and equivalents 
the goal of the investment policy is to obtain the highest yield possible while investing only in highly rated instruments or investments with nominal risk of loss of principal 
the investment policy sets forth a list of permitted investments and provides that any exceptions to the policy must be approved by the chief financial officer or the chief executive officer 
we anticipate that we will continue to invest our funds in highly liquid securities 
in december  we renewed our one year commercial line of credit agreement with a bank which provides for borrowings and issuance of letters of credit of up to million 
the line of credit is secured by investments of million 
under this line of credit  and pursuant to our humana agreement  at december   we had a million letter of credit issued in favor of humana 
at december   we had  of debt related to the july acquisition of a physician practice 
in october  we announced authorization for the repurchase of up to million shares of our outstanding common stock 
on both august  and february   the board of directors approved to increase the share repurchase program by five million shares  brining the total number of shares of common stock authorized for repurchase under the program to million shares 
in  we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million 
in  we repurchased million shares and options to purchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate of million 
from october  the date of our first repurchases under the plan through december   we repurchased million shares and options to purchase  shares of our common stock for million 
the number of shares to be repurchased and the timing of the purchases are influenced by a number of factors  including the then prevailing market price of our common stock  other perceived opportunities that may become available to us and regulatory requirements 
our total stockholders equity increased approximately million or  from approximately million at december  to approximately million at december  this increase was primarily a result of our net income which was partly offset by the shares acquired under our stock repurchase plan 
net cash provided by operating activities for was approximately million 
in addition to net income of million our significant sources of cash from operating activities were an increase in accrued payroll and payroll taxes of million  stock based compensation expense of million  and non cash depreciation and amortization expense of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by the following uses of cash an increase in due from humana of million  a decrease of income taxes payable of million  and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation expense of  net cash used in investing activities for was approximately million 
during  we acquired short term investments of million which was offset  in part  by the release of million of restricted cash 
net cash used in financing activities for was approximately million 
approximately million was used to repurchase our common stock  in accordance with the stock repurchase program discussed above 
this amount was partially offset by excess tax benefits from stock based compensation of  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and market prices 
we do not currently have any trading derivatives nor do we expect to have any in the future 
we have established policies and internal processes related to the management of market risks  which we use in the normal course of our business operations 
interest rate risk we monitor the third party depository institutions that hold our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we diversify our cash  cash equivalents and investments among counterparties and investment positions to minimize exposure to any one of these entities or investments 
as of december   none of our other investment positions represented more than of our total investment portfolio 
our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal while maximizing yield on those funds 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities  including us treasury securities  municipal bonds and corporate debt 
as of december   the fair value of our investment positions was million  approximately of which had a term to maturity of less than two years and a credit rating by a major rating agency of a or higher 
our investments are classified as trading securities 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  the value of our investments and or our income from investments may decrease in the future 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we do not hold any non us dollar denominated assets nor have we entered into any non us dollar denominated contracts 
accordingly  we do not have any foreign currency exchange rate risk 
equity price risk we do not own any equity investments  other than in our subsidiaries 
as a result  we do not currently have any direct equity price risk 
commodity price risk we do not enter into contracts for the purchase or sale of commodities 
as a result  we do not currently have any direct commodity price risk 
intangible asset risk we have intangible assets and perform goodwill impairment tests apart from the required annual impairment test of goodwill whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows 
as a result of our periodic evaluations  we may determine that the intangible asset values need to be written down to their fair values  which could result in material charges that could be adverse to our operating results and financial position 
we evaluate the continuing value of goodwill by using valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings  revenue and ebitda ie  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  particularly with regard to entities similar to us that have recently been acquired 
we also consider the market value of our own stock and those of companies similar to ours 
as of december   we believe our intangible assets  including goodwill are recoverable  however  changes in the economy  the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability 
we continue to monitor those assumptions and their effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets
