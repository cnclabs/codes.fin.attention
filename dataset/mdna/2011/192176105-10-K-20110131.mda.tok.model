overview we are an integrated wholesale coffee roaster and dealer in the united states and one of the few coffee companies that offers a broad array of coffee products across the entire spectrum of consumer tastes  preferences and price points 
as a result  we believe that we are well positioned to increase our profitability and endure potential coffee price volatility throughout varying cycles of the coffee market and economic conditions 
our operations have primarily focused on the following areas of the coffee industry the sale of wholesale specialty green coffee  the roasting  blending  packaging and sale of private label coffee  and the roasting  blending  packaging and sale of our seven brands of coffee 
our operating results are affected by a number of factors including the level of marketing and pricing competition from existing or new competitors in the coffee industry  our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers  fluctuations in purchase prices and supply of green coffee and in the selling prices of our products  and our ability to manage inventory and fulfillment operations and maintain gross margins 
our net sales are driven primarily by the success of our sales and marketing efforts and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers 
for this reason  we have made the strategic decision to invest in measures that will increase net sales 
in february  we acquired certain assets of premier roasters  llc  including equipment and a roasting facility in la junta  colorado 
we also hired a west coast brand manager to market our s w brand and to increase sales of s w coffee to new customers 
in april  we entered into a joint venture with caruso s coffee  inc of brecksville  ohio and formed gcc  which engages in the roasting  packaging and sale of private label specialty coffee products 
we own a equity interest in gcc and we are the exclusive supplier of its coffee inventory 
we believe that the joint venture will allow us to bid on the private label gourmet whole bean business which we have not been equipped to pursue from an operational standpoint in the past 
with this specialty roasting facility in place  in many cases right in the backyard of our most important wholesale and retail customers  we believe that we are in an ideal position to combine our current canned private label business with high end private label specialty whole bean business 
high end specialty whole bean coffee sells for as much as three times more per pound than the canned coffees in which we currently specialize 
as a result of these efforts  net sales increased in our specialty green coffee  private label and branded coffee business lines in both dollars and pounds sold 
in addition  the number of our customers in all three areas increased 
we closed our manufacturing operations at our brooklyn  new york location in may the majority of our processing has been moved to our colorado facility with our gcc facility in brecksville  ohio becoming more involved with our everyday coffee production 
we have leased office and warehouse space located in staten island  new york to house the corporate offices and serve as temporary storage of our branded product 
we sold the property located in brooklyn  new york in october for a pre tax gain of approximately  which enhanced our already strong cash position and liquidity 
we used the proceeds of the sale to pay down our line of credit borrowings and reduce interest expense 
although we incurred a related severance cost of  in the third quarter of fiscal year  we believe that these measures will reduce long term operating expenses  increase efficiencies and ultimately increase the profitability of our company 
on may   we completed the organic products transaction for a purchase price consisting of a  in cash on the closing date  b an additional  in cash if buyer generates a pre tax net profit of  or more within a certain period  which payment will be made on or before june   c  shares of company common stock on the closing date the common stock payment  d up to an additional  shares of company common stock if buyer generates a pre tax net profit of  or more within certain periods  which payments of up to  shares each will be made on june  and june  the supplemental common stock payments  and e on the closing date   which amount was based on the cost of inventory transferred to buyer 
all of the employees of seller became employees of buyer at the closing and buyer has entered into two year employment agreements with each of seller s principals  garth smith and gaylene smith  to ensure continuity of the business 
buyer will operate under the organic products trading company name from seller s vancouver  washington location 
in july  we entered into a three year licensing agreement with entenmann s products  inc  a subsidiary of entenmann s  inc  which was subsequently amended which is one of the nation s oldest baking companies 
the agreement gives us the exclusive rights to manufacture  market and distribute a full line of entenmann s brand coffee products throughout the united states 
we are continuing to develop not only mainstream entenmann s coffee items  but upscale flavored entenmann s products in twelve ounce valve bags as well 
these products will give the line a visible upscale image to our retailers and their customers  which we believe will be integral to the long term success of this arrangement 
our net sales are affected by the price of green coffee 
we purchase our green coffee from dealers located primarily within the united states 
the dealers supply us with coffee beans from many countries  including colombia  mexico  kenya  indonesia  brazil and uganda 
the supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our control 
for example  in brazil  which produces approximately of the world s green coffee  the coffee crops are historically susceptible to frost in june and july and drought in september  october and november 
however  because we purchase coffee from a number of countries and are able to freely substitute one country s coffee for another in our products  price fluctuations in one country generally have not had a material impact on the price we pay for coffee 
accordingly  price fluctuations in one country generally have not had a material effect on our results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
historically  because we generally have been able to pass green coffee price increases through to customers  increased prices of green coffee generally result in increased net sales 
we have used short term coffee futures and options contracts primarily for the purpose of partially hedging and minimizing the effects of changing green coffee prices and to reduce our cost of sales 
in addition  we acquire futures contracts with longer terms  generally three to four months  primarily for the purpose of guaranteeing an adequate supply of green coffee at favorable prices 
although the use of these derivative financial instruments has enabled us to mitigate the effect of changing prices  no strategy can entirely eliminate pricing risks and we generally remain exposed to loss when prices decline significantly in a short period of time 
in addition  we would remain exposed to supply risk in the event of non performance by the counterparties to any futures contracts 
if the hedges that we enter into do not adequately offset the risks of coffee bean price volatility or our hedges result in losses  our cost of sales may increase  resulting in a decrease in profitability 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  assets held for sale  income taxes and loss contingencies 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  may be impacted significantly by judgment  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements we recognize revenue in accordance with the relevant authoritative guidance 
revenue is recognized at the point title and risk of ownership transfers to its customers which is upon the shippers taking possession of the goods because i title passes in accordance with the terms of the purchase orders and with its agreements with its customers  ii any risk of loss is covered by the customers insurance  iii there is persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement  iv the sales price is determinable and v collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
thus  revenue is recognized at the point of shipment 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to provide for losses arising from customers inability to make required payments 
if there is deterioration of our customers credit worthiness and or there is an increase in the length of time that the receivables are past due greater than the historical assumptions used  additional allowances may be required 
for example  every additional one percent of our accounts receivable that becomes uncollectible  would decrease our operating income by approximately  for the year ended october  the reserve for sales discounts represents the estimated discount that customers will take upon payment 
the reserve for other allowances represents the estimated amount of returns  slotting fees and volume based discounts estimated to be incurred by the company from its customers 
inventories are stated at lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis or market 
based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions  inventories are subject to be written down to market value 
if our assumptions about future demand change and or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional write downs of inventories may be required 
each additional one percent of potential inventory writedown would have decreased operating income by approximately  for the year ended october  we account for income taxes in accordance with the relevant authoritative guidance 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are reflected on the balance sheet when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will be realized 
accordingly  our net deferred tax asset as of october  of  may require a valuation allowance if we do not generate taxable income 
our goodwill consists of the cost in excess of the fair market value of the acquired net assets of optco 
this company has been integrated into a structure which does not provide the basis for separate reporting units 
consequently  the company is a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes 
we also have intangible assets consisting of customer list and relationships and trademarks acquired from optco 
at october  our balance sheet reflected goodwill and intangible assets as set forth below october  customer list and relationships  net trademarks goodwill goodwill and the trademarks which are deemed to have indefinite lives are subject to annual impairment tests 
goodwill and trademarks impairment tests require the comparison of the fair value and carrying value of reporting units 
we assess the potential impairment of goodwill and trademarks annually and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
upon completion of such review  if impairment is found to have occurred  a corresponding charge will be recorded 
the value assigned to the customer list and relationships is being amortized over a twenty year period 
because the company is a single reporting unit  the closing nasdaq capital market price of our common stock as of the acquisition date was used as a basis to measure the fair value of goodwill 
in addition  the company retained a third party outside valuation firm to assist it in acquisition valuation as of may  goodwill and trademarks will be tested annually at the end of each fiscal year to determine whether they have been impaired 
upon completion of each annual review  there can be no assurance that a material charge will not be recorded 
impairment testing is required more often than annually if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment or decline in value may have occurred 
year ended october  fiscal year compared to the year ended october  fiscal year net income 
we had net income of  or per share basic and diluted  for the fiscal year ended october  compared to a net income of  or per share basic and diluted for the fiscal year ended october  results for the fiscal year ended october  include a one time gain of  or cents per share  on the sale of the company s brooklyn  new york facility 
net sales 
net sales totaled  for the fiscal year ended october   an increase of  or  from  for the fiscal year ended october  the increase in net sales reflects higher coffee prices during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  as well as an increase in pounds of coffee sold as we surpassed million pounds for the first time in the history of the company 
cost of sales 
cost of sales for the fiscal year ended october  was  or of net sales  as compared to  or  of net sales for the fiscal year ended october  cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of green coffee and packaging materials and realized and unrealized gains or losses on hedging activity 
the increase in cost of sales reflects the increased cost of green coffee 
cost of sales includes purchases of approximately million and million in fiscal years and  respectively  from a related party 
gross profit 
gross profit for the fiscal year ended october  was  an increase of  from  for the fiscal year ended october  gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the fiscal year ended october  from for the fiscal year ended october  due to higher green coffee prices 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased  or  to  for the fiscal year ended october  from  for the fiscal year ended october  due to a slight increase in selling and administrative expense  partially offset by a slight decrease in officers salaries 
selling and administrative expenses increased  or  to  for the year ended october  from  for the slight increase in selling and administrative expenses reflects several factors  including increases of approximately  in advertising costs   in insurance cost   in professional services   in office expenses and  in travel show and demo costs  partially offset by decreases of approximately  in salaries   in utilities and  in moving costs 
advertising and travel show and demo costs increased as we were much more aggressive in the promotion of our products in the attempt to expand our markets 
professional services increase primarily due to the acquisition of our subsidiary optco and insurance costs increased due to the coverage of optco 
salaries decreased due to our cost cutting efforts  utilities decreased due to the shifting of our manufacturing to colorado and ohio and the moving costs were a one time cost incurred in fiscal other income expense 
other expense was  for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to other income of  for the fiscal year ended october  the decrease in other income was attributable to the sale of our manufacturing facilities during fiscal income before taxes and noncontrolling interest in subsidiary 
we had income of  before income taxes and noncontrolling interest in subsidiary for the fiscal year ended october  compared to income of  for the fiscal year ended october  the sale of our manufacturing facilities during fiscal resulted in a one time gain of  the income for the year ended october  would have been  without the gain from the sale of our manufacturing facility 
therefore a comparison on an operational basis  as adjusted for the effect of the one time gain on the sales of the facility  shows that our income actually increased  for the year ended october  from  to  the increase was primarily attributable to our increased gross profit on higher sales 
income taxes 
our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended october  totaled  compared to a provision of  for the fiscal year ended october  the change was attributable to lower total income due to the sale of our manufacturing facility during fiscal liquidity and capital resources as of october   we had working capital of  which represented a  increase from our working capital of  as of october   and total stockholders equity of  which increased by  from our total stockholders equity of  as of october  our working capital increased primarily due to an increase of  in inventories and  in prepaid green coffee  partially offset by a decrease of  in accounts receivable 
at october   the outstanding balance on our line of credit was  compared to  at october  total stockholders equity increased primarily due to an increase in retained earnings as a result of our net income for fiscal year on february   the company entered into a financing agreement with sterling national bank sterling for a  credit facility

the credit facility also requires that the company maintain a minimum working capital at all times 
the initial borrowings under the revolving credit facility were used to repay the outstanding principal and accrued interest under the  line of credit previously held with merrill lynch  which was terminated and replaced with the revolving line of credit  with the excess being available for working capital purposes 
on july   the company had the credit facility increased to  in addition  optco was added as a co borrower and the inventory sublimit was raised from  to  the term of the facility has been extended to february  additionally  the company received a limited credit guarantee of  from the not for profit entity cordaid that is available to be used as collateral for the loan facility to sterling

as of october  and the outstanding balance under the bank line of credit was  and  respectively 
the company was in compliance with all required financial covenants at october  and we closed our manufacturing operations at our brooklyn  new york location in may the majority of our processing has been moved to our la junta  colorado facility with our gcc facility in brecksville  ohio becoming more involved with our everyday coffee production

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and commodity prices as further described below 
interest rate risks 
we are subject to market risk from exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
at october   our debt consisted of  of variable rate debt under our revolving line of credit 
our line of credit provides for a maximum of  and is payable monthly in arrears on the average unpaid balance of the line of credit at an interest rate equal to a per annum reference rate currently plus 
this loan is secured by tangible and intangible assets of the company 
commodity price risks 
the supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our control 
historically  we have used short term coffee futures and options contracts generally with terms of two months or less primarily for the purpose of partially hedging and minimizing the effects of changing green coffee prices  as further explained in note of the notes to financial statements in this report 
in addition  during the latter half of fiscal  we began to acquire futures contracts with longer terms generally three to four months primarily for the purpose of guaranteeing an adequate supply of green coffee 
the use of these derivative financial instruments has enabled us to mitigate the effect of changing prices although we generally remain exposed to loss when prices decline significantly in a short period of time or remain at higher levels  preventing us from obtaining inventory at favorable prices 
we generally have been able to pass green coffee price increases through to customers  thereby maintaining our gross profits 
however  we cannot predict whether we will be able to pass inventory price increases through to our customers in the future 
we believe our hedging policies remain a vital element to our business model not only in controlling our cost of sales  but also giving us the flexibility to obtain the inventory necessary to continue to grow our sales while minimizing margin compression during a time of historically high coffee prices 
at october   the company held future contracts for the purchase of  pounds of coffee at a weighted average price of per pound compared to future contracts for the purchase of  pounds of coffee at a weighted average price of per pound for the fiscal year ended october  the fair market value of coffee applicable to such contracts was and per pound  respectively
