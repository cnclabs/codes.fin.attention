item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates hedging activities 
the recent adoption of derivatives legislation by the us congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business 
the us congress recently adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation  known as the dodd frank act  that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over the counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market 
the dodd frank act was signed into law by the president on july   and requires the commodities futures trading commission  or cftc  and the sec to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation within days from the date of enactment 
the act also requires the cftc to institute broad new position limits for futures and options traded on regulated exchanges 
as the law favors exchange trading and clearing  the dodd frank act also may require us to move certain derivatives transactions to exchanges where no trade credit is provided and also comply with margin requirements in connection with our derivatives activities that are not exchange traded  although the application of those provisions to us is uncertain at this time 
the dodd frank act also requires many counterparties to our derivatives instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to a separate entity  which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty  or cause the entity to comply with the capital requirements  which could result in increased costs to counterparties such as us 
the dodd frank act and any new regulations could i significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts including requirements to post collateral  which could adversely affect our available liquidity  ii reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter  and iii reduce the liquidity of energy related derivatives 
if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and regulations  our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable  which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures 
increased volatility may make us less attractive to certain types of investors 
finally  the dodd frank act was intended  in part  to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas 
our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices 
any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our kinder morgan canada segment is subject to us dollar canadian dollar exchange rate fluctuations 
we are a us dollar reporting company 
as a result of the operations of our kinder morgan canada business segment  a portion of our consolidated assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses are denominated in canadian dollars 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between united states and canadian dollars could expose us to reductions in the us dollar value of our earnings and cash flows and a reduction in our partners capital under applicable accounting rules 
our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions 
economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed to slowdowns in several industries  including the oil and gas industry  the steel industry and in specific segments and markets in which we operate  resulting in reduced demand and increased price competition for our products and services 
our operating results in one or more geographic regions also may be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions within that region  such as the challenges that are currently affecting economic conditions in the united states and canada 
volatility in commodity prices might have an impact on many of our customers  which in turn could have a negative impact on their ability to meet their obligations to us 
in addition  decreases in the prices of crude oil and natural gas liquids will have a negative impact on the results of our co business segment 
if global economic and market conditions including volatility in commodity markets  or economic conditions in the united states or other key markets  remain uncertain or persist  spread or deteriorate further  we may experience material impacts on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
hurricanes  earthquakes and other natural disasters could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
some of our pipelines  terminals and other assets are located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes  earthquakes and other natural disasters 
these natural disasters could potentially damage or destroy our pipelines  terminals and other assets and disrupt the supply of the products we transport through our pipelines 
natural disasters can similarly affect the facilities of our customers 
in either case  losses could exceed our insurance coverage and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected  perhaps materially 
terrorist attacks  or the threat of them  may adversely affect our business 
the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that pipelines and other energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations 
these potential targets might include our pipeline systems  terminals or storage facilities 
our operations could become subject to increased governmental scrutiny that would require increased security measures 
there is no assurance that adequate sabotage and terrorism insurance will be available at rates we believe are reasonable in the near future 
these developments may subject our operations to increased risks  as well as increased costs  and  depending on their ultimate magnitude  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to our common units the interests of kmi may differ from our interests and the interests of our unitholders 
kmi indirectly owns all of the common stock of our general partner and elects all of its directors 
our general partner owns all of kmr s voting shares and elects all of its directors 
furthermore  some of kmr s directors and officers are also directors and officers of kmi and our general partner and have fiduciary duties to manage the businesses of kmi in a manner that may not be in the best interests of our unitholders 
kmi has a number of interests that differ from the interests of our unitholders 
as a result  there is a risk that important business decisions will not be made in the best interests of our unitholders 
common unitholders have limited voting rights and limited control 
holders of common units have only limited voting rights on matters affecting us 
our general partner manages partnership activities 
under a delegation of control agreement  our general partner has delegated the management and control of our and our subsidiaries business and affairs to kmr 
holders of common units have no right to elect the general partner on an annual or other ongoing basis 
if the general partner withdraws  however  its successor may be elected by the holders of a majority of the outstanding common units excluding units owned by the departing general partner and its affiliates 
the limited partners may remove the general partner only if i the holders of at least of the outstanding common units  excluding common units owned by the departing general partner and its affiliates  vote to remove the general partner  ii a successor general partner is approved by at least of the outstanding common units  excluding common units owned by the departing general partner and its affiliates  and iii we receive an opinion of counsel opining that the removal would not result in the loss of limited liability to any limited partner  or the limited partner of an operating partnership  or cause us or the operating partnership to be taxed other than as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
a person or group owning or more of the common units cannot vote 
any common units held by a person or group that owns or more of the common units cannot be voted 
this limitation does not apply to the general partner and its affiliates 
this provision may i discourage a person or group from attempting to remove the general partner or otherwise change management  and ii reduce the price at which the common units will trade under certain circumstances 
for example  a third party will probably not attempt to take over our management by making a tender offer for the common units at a price above their trading market price without removing the general partner and substituting an affiliate of its own 
the general partner s liability to us and our unitholders may be limited 
our partnership agreement contains language limiting the liability of the general partner to us or the holders of common units 
for example  our partnership agreement provides that i the general partner does not breach any duty to us or the holders of common units by borrowing funds or approving any borrowing the general partner is protected even if the purpose or effect of the borrowing is to increase incentive distributions to the general partner  ii the general partner does not breach any duty to us or the holders of common units by taking any actions consistent with the standards of reasonable discretion outlined in the definitions of available cash and cash from operations contained in our partnership agreement  and iii the general partner does not breach any standard of care or duty by resolving conflicts of interest unless the general partner acts in bad faith 
unitholders may have liability to repay distributions 
unitholders will not be liable for assessments in addition to their initial capital investment in the common units 
under certain circumstances  however  holders of common units may have to repay us amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them 
under delaware law  we may not make a distribution to unitholders if the distribution causes our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets 
liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and non recourse liabilities are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted 
delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of such a distribution  a limited partner who receives the distribution and knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution violated delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount 
under delaware law  an assignee who becomes a substituted limited partner of a limited partnership is liable for the obligations of the assignor to make contributions to the partnership 
however  such an assignee is not obligated for liabilities unknown to the assignee at the time the assignee became a limited partner if the liabilities could not be determined from the partnership agreement 
unitholders may be liable if we have not complied with state partnership law 
we conduct our business in a number of states 
in some of those states the limitations on the liability of limited partners for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established 
the unitholders might be held liable for the partnership s obligations as if they were a general partner if i a court or government agency determined that we were conducting business in the state but had not complied with the state s partnership statute  or ii unitholders rights to act together to remove or replace the general partner or take other actions under our partnership agreement constitute control of our business 
the general partner may buy out minority unitholders if it owns of the units 
if at any time the general partner and its affiliates own or more of the issued and outstanding common units  the general partner will have the right to purchase all  and only all  of the remaining common units 
because of this right  a unitholder could have to sell its common units at a time or price that may be undesirable 
the purchase price for such a purchase will be the greater of i the day average trading price for the common units as of the date five days prior to the date the notice of purchase is mailed  or ii the highest purchase price paid by the general partner or its affiliates to acquire common units during the prior days 
the general partner can assign this right to its affiliates or to us 
we may sell additional limited partner interests  diluting existing interests of unitholders 
our partnership agreement allows the general partner to cause us to issue additional common units and other equity securities 
when we issue additional equity securities  including additional i units to kmr when it issues additional shares  unitholders proportionate partnership interest in us will decrease 
such an issuance could negatively affect the amount of cash distributed to unitholders and the market price of common units 
issuance of additional common units will also diminish the relative voting strength of the previously outstanding common units 
our partnership agreement does not limit the total number of common units or other equity securities we may issue 
the general partner can protect itself against dilution 
whenever we issue equity securities to any person other than the general partner and its affiliates  the general partner has the right to purchase additional limited partnership interests on the same terms 
this allows the general partner to maintain its proportionate partnership interest in us 
no other unitholder has a similar right 
therefore  only the general partner may protect itself against dilution caused by issuance of additional equity securities 
our partnership agreement and the kmr limited liability company agreement restrict or eliminate a number of the fiduciary duties that would otherwise be owed by our general partner and or its delegate to our unitholders 
modifications of state law standards of fiduciary duties may significantly limit the ability of our unitholders to successfully challenge the actions of our general partner in the event of a breach of fiduciary duties 
these state law standards include the duties of care and loyalty 
the duty of loyalty  in the absence of a provision in the limited partnership agreement to the contrary  would generally prohibit our general partner from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest 
our limited partnership agreement contains provisions that prohibit limited partners from advancing claims that otherwise might raise issues as to compliance with fiduciary duties or applicable law 
for example  that agreement provides that the general partner may take into account the interests of parties other than us in resolving conflicts of interest 
it also provides that in the absence of bad faith by the general partner  the resolution of a conflict by the general partner will not be a breach of any duty 
the provisions relating to the general partner apply equally to kmr as its delegate 
it is not necessary for a limited partner to sign our limited partnership agreement in order for the limited partnership agreement to be enforceable against that person 
our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes  as well as our not being subject to a material amount of entity level taxation by individual states 
if the internal revenue service were to treat us as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes or if we were to become subject to a material amount of entity level taxation for state tax purposes  then our cash available for distribution to our common unitholders would be substantially reduced 
the anticipated after tax economic benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes 
to maintain our status as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes  current law requires that or more of our gross income for every taxable year consist of qualifying income  as defined in section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  which we refer to as the code 
we have not requested  and do not plan to request  a ruling from the internal revenue service  which we refer to as the irs  on this or any other matter affecting us 
despite the fact that we are a limited partnership under delaware law  it is possible under certain circumstances for such an entity to be treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes 
if we were to be treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes  we would pay us federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate  which is currently a maximum of  and would pay state income taxes at varying rates 
distributions to our unitholders would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions  and no income  gains  losses or deductions would flow through to our unitholders 
because a tax would be imposed on us as a corporation  our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced 
therefore  treatment of us as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after tax return to our common unitholders  likely causing a substantial reduction in the amount of distributions we pay  and in the value of our common units 
current law or our business may change  causing us to be treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes or otherwise subjecting us to a material amount of entity level taxation 
in addition  because of widespread state budget deficits and other reasons  several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income  franchise or other forms of taxation 
for example  we are now subject to an entity level tax on the portion of our total revenue that is generated in texas 
specifically  the texas margin tax is imposed at a maximum effective rate of of our gross income that is apportioned to texas 
this tax reduces  and the imposition of such a tax on us by another state will reduce  the cash available for distribution to our common unitholders 
our partnership agreement provides that if a law is enacted that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity level taxation for us federal income tax purposes  the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels will be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us 
the tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our common units could be subject to potential legislative  judicial or administrative changes and differing interpretations  possibly on a retroactive basis 
the present us federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships  including us  or an investment in our common units  may be modified by administrative  legislative or judicial interpretation at any time 
recently  members of the us congress considered substantive changes to the existing us federal income tax laws that would have affected the tax treatment of certain publicly traded partnerships 
any modification to the us federal income tax laws or interpretations thereof may or may not be applied retroactively 
although we are unable to predict whether any of these changes or any other proposals will ultimately be enacted  any changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units 
we prorate our items of income  gain  loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our common units each month based upon the ownership of our common units on the first day of each month  instead of on the basis of the date a particular common unit is transferred 
we prorate our items of income  gain  loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our common units each month based upon the ownership of our common units on the first day of each month  instead of on the basis of the date a particular common unit is transferred 
the use of this proration method may not be permitted under existing treasury regulations  and  accordingly  our counsel is unable to opine as to the validity of this method 
if the irs were to challenge this method or new treasury regulations were issued  we may be required to change the allocation of items of income  gain  loss and deduction among our common unitholders 
if the irs contests the us federal income tax positions we take  the market for our common units may be adversely impacted and the cost of any irs contest will reduce our cash available for distribution to our common unitholders 
we have not requested a ruling from the irs with respect to our treatment as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes or any other matter affecting us 
the irs may adopt positions that differ from the conclusions of our counsel or from the positions we take 
it may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of our counsel conclusions or the positions we take 
a court may not agree with some or all of our counsel conclusions or the positions we take 
any contest with the irs may materially and adversely impact the market for our common units and the price at which they trade 
in addition  our costs of any contest with the irs will be borne indirectly by our common unitholders and our general partner because the costs will reduce our cash available for distribution 
our common unitholders will be required to pay taxes on their share of our income even if they do not receive any cash distributions from us 
because our common unitholders are treated as partners to whom we allocate taxable income which could be different in amount than the cash we distribute  they are required to pay any us federal income taxes and  in some cases  state and local income taxes on their share of our taxable income even if they do not receive any cash distributions from us 
common unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from that income 
tax gain or loss on disposition of our common units could be more or less than expected 
if a common unitholder sells its common units  the common unitholder will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and that common unitholder s adjusted tax basis in those common units 
because distributions in excess of a common unitholder s allocable share of our net taxable income decrease that unitholder s tax basis in its common units  the amount  if any  of such prior excess distributions with respect to the common units sold will  in effect  become taxable income allocated to that unitholder if the unitholder sells such common units at a price greater than that unitholder s tax basis in those common units  even if the price received is less than the original cost 
furthermore  a substantial portion of the amount realized  whether or not representing gain  may be taxed as ordinary income due to potential recapture items  including depreciation recapture 
in addition  because the amount realized may include a common unitholder share of our nonrecourse liabilities  if a unitholder sells its common units  such unitholder may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash received from the sale 
tax exempt entities and non us persons face unique tax issues from owning our common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them 
investment in common units by tax exempt entities  such as employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts known as iras  and non us persons raises issues unique to them 
for example  virtually all of our income allocated to organizations exempt from us federal income tax  including iras and other retirement plans  will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to them 
distributions to non us persons will be reduced by withholding taxes imposed at the highest applicable effective tax rate  and non us persons will be required to file non us federal income tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income 
any tax exempt entity or non us person should consult its tax advisor before investing in our common units 
we treat each purchaser of our common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual common units purchased 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could adversely affect the value of the common units 
because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units and because of other reasons  we adopted depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing treasury regulations 
our counsel is unable to opine on the validity of such filing positions 
a successful irs challenge to these positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to a common unitholder 
it could also affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from any sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to a common unitholder s tax returns 
we adopted certain valuation methodologies that may result in a shift of income  gain  loss and deduction between our general partner and the common unitholders 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could adversely affect the value of the common units 
when we issue additional common units or engage in certain other transactions  we determine the fair market value of our assets and allocate any unrealized gain or loss attributable to our assets to the capital accounts of our common unitholders and our general partner 
our methodology may be viewed as understating the value of our assets 
in that case  there may be a shift of income  gain  loss and deduction between certain unitholders and our general partner  which may be unfavorable to such unitholders 
moreover  under our current valuation methods  subsequent purchasers of common units may have a greater portion of their adjustment under section b of the code allocated to our tangible assets and a lesser portion allocated to our intangible assets 
the irs may challenge our valuation methods  or our allocation of the adjustment under section b of the code attributable to our tangible and intangible assets  and allocations of income  gain  loss and deduction between our general partner and certain of our unitholders 
a successful irs challenge to these methods or allocations could adversely affect the amount of taxable income or loss being allocated to our common unitholders and our general partner 
it also could affect the amount of gain from our common unitholders sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of the common units or result in audit adjustments to our common unitholders or our general partner s tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions 
the sale or exchange of or more of our capital and profits interests during any twelve month period will result in a termination of our partnership for us federal income tax purposes 
we will be considered to have terminated for us federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within any twelve month period 
our termination would  among other things  result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders and could result in a significant deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income 
in the case of a common unitholder reporting on a taxable year other than a fiscal year ending december  the closing of our taxable year may also result in more than twelve months of our taxable income being includable in the common unitholder taxable income for the year of termination 
our termination currently would not affect our classification as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes  but instead  we would be treated as a new partnership for tax purposes 
if treated as a new partnership  we must make new tax elections and could be subject to penalties if we are unable to determine that a termination occurred 
a common unitholder whose common units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale may be considered as having disposed of those common units 
if so  the common unitholder would no longer be treated for us federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition 
because a common unitholder whose common units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale may be considered as having disposed of the loaned common units  the unitholder may no longer be treated for us federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan to the short seller and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition 
moreover  during the period of the loan to the short seller  any of our income  gain  loss or deduction with respect to those units may not be reportable by the common unitholder and any cash distributions received by the common unitholder as to those common units could be fully taxable as ordinary income 
our counsel has not rendered an opinion regarding the treatment of a unitholder where common units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of common units  therefore  common unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short seller are urged to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing their common units 
the issuance of additional i units may cause more taxable income and gain to be allocated to the common units 
the i units we issue to kmr generally are not allocated income  gain  loss or deduction for us federal income tax purposes until such time as we are liquidated 
therefore  the issuance of additional i units may cause more taxable income and gain to be allocated to the common unitholders 
as a result of investing in our common units  a common unitholder may become subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in jurisdictions where we operate or own or acquire property 
in addition to us federal income taxes  our common unitholders will likely be subject to other taxes  including foreign  state and local taxes  unincorporated business taxes and estate  inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business or own property now or in the future  even if they do not live in any of those jurisdictions 
our common unitholders will likely be required to file foreign  state and local income tax returns and pay foreign  state and local income taxes in some or all of these various jurisdictions 
further  our common unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements 
we currently own assets and conduct business in numerous states in the united states and in canada 
it is the responsibility of each common unitholder to file all required us federal  foreign  state and local tax returns 
our counsel has not rendered an opinion on the foreign  state or local tax consequences of an investment in our common units 
risks related to ownership of our common units if we or kmi defaults on debt unitholders may have negative tax consequences if we default on our debt or sell assets 
if we default on any of our debt  the lenders will have the right to sue us for non payment 
such an action could cause an investment loss and cause negative tax consequences for unitholders through the realization of taxable income by unitholders without a corresponding cash distribution 
likewise  if we were to dispose of assets and realize a taxable gain while there is substantial debt outstanding and proceeds of the sale were applied to the debt  unitholders could have increased taxable income without a corresponding cash distribution 
there is the potential for a change of control of our general partner if kmi defaults on debt 
kmi indirectly owns all the common stock of our general partner 
kmi has operations which provide cash independent of dividends that kmi receives from our general partner 
nevertheless  if kmi or kinder morgan kansas  inc defaults on its debt  then the lenders under such debt  in exercising their rights as lenders  could acquire control of our general partner or otherwise influence our general partner through control of kmi or kinder morgan kansas  inc item b

our reportable business segments are products pipelines the ownership and operation of refined petroleum products pipelines that deliver gasoline  diesel fuel  jet fuel and natural gas liquids to various markets  plus the ownership and or operation of associated product terminals and petroleum pipeline transmix facilities  natural gas pipelines the ownership and operation of major interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline and storage systems  plus the ownership and or operation of associated natural gas processing and treating facilities  co i the production  transportation and marketing of carbon dioxide  referred to as co  to oil fields that use co to increase production of oil  ii ownership interests in and or operation of oil fields in west texas  and iii the ownership and operation of a crude oil pipeline system in west texas  terminals the ownership and or operation of liquids and bulk terminal facilities and rail transloading and materials handling facilities located throughout the united states and portions of canada  and kinder morgan canada i the ownership and operation of the trans mountain pipeline system that transports crude oil and refined petroleum products from edmonton  alberta  canada to marketing terminals and refineries in british columbia  canada and the state of washington  ii the interest in the express crude oil pipeline system  which connects canadian and us producers to refineries located in the us rocky mountain and midwest regions  and iii the jet fuel aviation turbine fuel pipeline that serves the vancouver canada international airport 
as an energy infrastructure owner and operator in multiple facets of the united states and canada s various energy businesses and markets  we examine a number of variables and factors on a routine basis to evaluate our current performance and our prospects for the future 
many of our operations are regulated by various us and canadian regulatory bodies and a portion of our business portfolio including our kinder morgan canada business segment  the canadian portion of our cochin pipeline  and our bulk and liquids terminal facilities located in canada uses the local canadian dollar as the functional currency for its canadian operations and enters into foreign currency based transactions  both of which affect segment results due to the inherent variability in u 
s canadian dollar exchange rates 
to help understand our reported operating results  all of the following references to currency translation impacts  currency changes or similar terms in this section represent our estimates of the changes in financial results  in us dollars  resulting from fluctuations in the relative value of the canadian dollar to the us dollar 
the references are made to facilitate period to period comparisons of business performance and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other registrants 
the profitability of our refined petroleum products pipeline transportation business is generally driven by the volume of petroleum products that we transport and the prices we receive for our services 
transportation volume levels are primarily driven by the demand for the petroleum products being shipped or stored 
demand for petroleum products tends to track in large measure demographic and economic growth  and with the exception of periods of time with very high product prices or recessionary conditions  demand tends to be relatively stable 
because of that  we seek to own refined products pipelines located in  or that transport to  stable or growing markets and population centers 
the prices for shipping are generally based on regulated tariffs that are adjusted annually based on changes in the us producer price index 
the regulatory returns on our products pipelines  like our interstate natural gas pipelines and canadian pipelines  mitigate the downside of these operations 
with respect to our interstate natural gas pipelines and related storage facilities  the revenues from these assets are primarily received under contracts with terms that are fixed for various and extended periods of time 
to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors  we generally attempt to mitigate risk of reduced volumes and prices by negotiating contracts with longer terms  with higher per unit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity 
these long term contracts are typically structured with a fixed fee reserving the right to transport natural gas and specify that we receive the majority of our fee for making the capacity available  whether or not the customer actually chooses to utilize the capacity 
similarly  in our texas intrastate pipeline business  we have long term transport and sales requirements with minimum volume payment obligations which secure approximately of our sales and transport margins in that business 
therefore  where we have long term contracts  we are not exposed to short term changes in commodity supply or demand 
however  as contracts expire  we do have exposure to the longer term trends in supply and demand for natural gas 
as of december   the remaining average contract life of our natural gas transportation contracts including our intrastate pipelines was approximately nine years 
our co sales and transportation business  like our natural gas pipelines business  has primarily fixed fee contracts with minimum volume requirements  which as of december   had a remaining average contract life of years 
on a volume weighted basis  approximately of our contractual volumes are based on a fixed fee  and fluctuates with the price of oil 
in the long term  our success in this business is driven by the demand for carbon dioxide 
however  short term changes in the demand for carbon dioxide typically do not have a significant impact on us due to the required minimum sales volumes under many of our contracts 
in our co segment s oil and gas producing activities  we monitor the amount of capital we expend in relation to the amount of production that we expect to add 
in that regard  our production during any period is an important measure 
in addition  the revenues we receive from our crude oil  natural gas liquids and carbon dioxide sales are affected by the prices we realize from the sale of these products 
over the long term  we will tend to receive prices that are dictated by the demand and overall market price for these products 
in the shorter term  however  market prices are likely not indicative of the revenues we will receive due to our risk management  or hedging  program  in which the prices to be realized for certain of our future sales quantities are fixed  capped or bracketed through the use of financial derivative contracts  particularly for crude oil 
our realized weighted average crude oil price per barrel  with all hedges allocated to oil  was per barrel in  per barrel in  and per barrel in had we not used energy derivative contracts to transfer commodity price risk  our crude oil sales prices would have averaged per barrel in  per barrel in and per barrel in the factors impacting our terminals business segment generally differ depending on whether the terminal is a liquids or bulk terminal  and in the case of a bulk terminal  the type of product being handled or stored 
as with our products pipeline transportation business  the revenues from our bulk terminals business are generally driven by the volumes we handle and or store  as well as the prices we receive for our services  which in turn are driven by the demand for the products being shipped or stored 
while we handle and store a large variety of products in our bulk terminals  the primary products are coal  petroleum coke  and steel 
for the most part  we have contracts for this business that have minimum volume guarantees and are volume based above the minimums 
because these contracts are volume based above the minimums  our profitability from the bulk business can be sensitive to economic conditions 
our liquids terminals business generally has longer term contracts that require the customer to pay regardless of whether they use the capacity 
thus  similar to our natural gas pipeline business  our liquids terminals business is less sensitive to short term changes in supply and demand 
therefore  the extent to which changes in these variables affect our terminals business in the near term is a function of the length of the underlying service contracts which is typically approximately three years  the extent to which revenues under the contracts are a function of the amount of product stored or transported  and the extent to which such contracts expire during any given period of time 
to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors  we generally attempt to mitigate the risk of reduced volumes and pricing by negotiating contracts with longer terms  with higher per unit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity 
in addition  weather related factors such as hurricanes  floods and droughts may impact our facilities and access to them and  thus  the profitability of certain terminals for limited periods of time or  in relatively rare cases of severe damage to facilities  for longer periods 
in our discussions of the operating results of individual businesses that follow see results of operations below  we generally identify the important fluctuations between periods that are attributable to acquisitions and dispositions separately from those that are attributable to businesses owned in both periods 
continuing our history of making accretive acquisitions and economically advantageous expansions of existing businesses  in  we invested approximately billion for both strategic business acquisitions and expansions of existing assets 
our capital investments have helped us to achieve compound annual growth rates in cash distributions to our limited partners of   and  respectively  for the one year  three year  and five year periods ended december  thus  the amount that we are able to increase distributions to our unitholders will  to some extent  be a function of our ability to complete successful acquisitions and expansions 
we believe we will continue to have opportunities for expansion of our facilities in many markets  and we have budgeted approximately billion for our capital expansion program  including small acquisitions and investment contributions 
based on our historical record and because there is continued demand for energy infrastructure in the areas we serve  we expect to continue to have such opportunities in the future  although the level of such opportunities is difficult to predict 
our ability to make accretive acquisitions is a function of the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at the right cost  and includes factors over which we have limited or no control 
thus  we have no way to determine the number or size of accretive acquisition candidates in the future  or whether we will complete the acquisition of any such candidates 
in addition  our ability to make accretive acquisitions or expand our assets is impacted by our ability to maintain adequate liquidity and to raise the necessary capital needed to fund such acquisitions 
as a master limited partnership  we distribute all of our available cash and we access capital markets to fund acquisitions and asset expansions 
historically  we have succeeded in raising necessary capital in order to fund our acquisitions and expansions  often doing so during periods of notably tight financial conditions 
for example  in december  we raised a combined million in cash from public debt and equity offerings 
although we cannot predict future changes in the overall equity and debt capital markets in terms of tightening or loosening of credit  we believe that our stable cash flows  our investment grade credit rating  and our historical record of successfully accessing both equity and debt funding sources should allow us to continue to execute our current investment  distribution and acquisition strategies  as well as refinance maturing debt when required 
for a further discussion of our liquidity  including our public debt and equity offerings in  please see financial condition below 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting standards require information in financial statements about the risks and uncertainties inherent in significant estimates  and the application of generally accepted accounting principles involves the exercise of varying degrees of judgment 
certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time our financial statements are prepared 
these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for our assets and liabilities  our revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we routinely evaluate these estimates  utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates  and any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures  examples of certain areas that require more judgment relative to others include our use of estimates in determining i the economic useful lives of our assets  ii the fair values used to assign purchase price from business combinations  determine possible asset impairment charges  and calculate the annual goodwill impairment test  iii reserves for environmental claims  legal fees  transportation rate cases and other litigation liabilities  iv provisions for uncollectible accounts receivables  v exposures under contractual indemnifications  and vi unbilled revenues 
for a summary of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we believe that certain accounting policies are of more significance in our consolidated financial statement preparation process than others  which policies are discussed as follows 
environmental matters with respect to our environmental exposure  we utilize both internal staff and external experts to assist us in identifying environmental issues and in estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts 
we expense or capitalize  as appropriate  environmental expenditures that relate to current operations  and we record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable and we can reasonably estimate the costs 
generally  we do not discount environmental liabilities to a net present value  and we recognize receivables for anticipated associated insurance recoveries when such recoveries are deemed to be probable 
our recording of our environmental accruals often coincides with our completion of a feasibility study or our commitment to a formal plan of action  but generally  we recognize and or adjust our environmental liabilities following routine reviews of potential environmental issues and claims that could impact our assets or operations 
these adjustments may result in increases in environmental expenses and are primarily related to quarterly reviews of potential environmental issues and resulting environmental liability estimates 
these environmental liability adjustments are recorded pursuant to our management s requirement to recognize contingent environmental liabilities whenever the associated environmental issue is likely to occur and the amount of our liability can be reasonably estimated 
in making these liability estimations  we consider the effect of environmental compliance  pending legal actions against us  and potential third party liability claims 
for more information on our environmental disclosures  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
legal matters we are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings as a result of our business operations and transactions 
we utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from orders  judgments or settlements 
in general  we expense legal costs as incurred  accordingly  to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates  or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates  our earnings will be affected 
when we identify specific litigation that is expected to continue for a significant period of time and require substantial expenditures  we identify a range of possible costs expected to be required to litigate the matter to a conclusion or reach an acceptable settlement 
generally  if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount  we record a liability equal to the low end of the range 
any such liability recorded is revised as better information becomes available 
as of december   our most significant ongoing litigation proceedings involved our west coast products pipelines 
transportation rates charged by certain of these pipeline systems are subject to proceedings at the ferc and the cpuc involving shipper challenges to the pipelines interstate and intrastate california rates  respectively 
following the ferc s approval of a settlement agreement we reached with certain shippers related to a substantial portion of our historical ferc rate challenges on our sfpp  lp pipelines  we made settlement payments totaling million in june a second settlement with the only remaining litigant shipper was filed at the ferc in february which will resolve the remaining historical ferc rate challenges on our sfpp  lp pipelines 
the ferc has not yet acted on the second settlement

intangible assets intangible assets are those assets which provide future economic benefit but have no physical substance 
identifiable intangible assets having indefinite useful economic lives  including goodwill  are not subject to regular periodic amortization  and such assets are not to be amortized until their lives are determined to be finite 
instead  the carrying amount of a recognized intangible asset with an indefinite useful life must be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset has decreased below its carrying value 
we evaluate our goodwill for impairment on may of each year 
there were no impairment charges resulting from our may  impairment testing  and no event indicating an impairment has occurred subsequent to that date 
for more information on our goodwill  see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
excluding goodwill  our other intangible assets include customer relationships  contracts and agreements  technology based assets  and lease value 
these intangible assets have definite lives  are being amortized in a systematic and rational manner over their estimated useful lives  and are reported separately as other intangibles  net in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
for more information on our amortizable intangibles  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
estimated net recoverable quantities of oil and gas we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities 
the successful efforts method inherently relies on the estimation of proved reserves  both developed and undeveloped 
the existence and the estimated amount of proved reserves affect  among other things  whether certain costs are capitalized or expensed  the amount and timing of costs depleted or amortized into income  and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities 
the expected future cash flows to be generated by oil and gas producing properties used in testing for impairment of such properties also rely in part on estimates of net recoverable quantities of oil and gas 
proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geologic and engineering data demonstrates with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
estimates of proved reserves may change  either positively or negatively  as additional information becomes available and as contractual  economic and political conditions change 
for more information on our ownership interests in the net quantities of proved oil and gas reserves  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
hedging activities we engage in a hedging program that utilizes derivative contracts to mitigate offset our exposure to fluctuations in energy commodity prices and to balance our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates  and we believe that these hedges are generally effective in realizing these objectives 
according to the provisions of current accounting standards  to be considered effective  changes in the value of a derivative contract or its resulting cash flows must substantially offset changes in the value or cash flows of the item being hedged  and any ineffective portion of the hedge gain or loss and any component excluded from the computation of the effectiveness of the derivative contract must be reported in earnings immediately 
since it is not always possible for us to engage in a hedging transaction that completely mitigates our exposure to unfavorable changes in commodity prices a perfectly effective hedge we often enter into hedges that are not completely effective in those instances where we believe to do so would be better than not hedging at all 
but because the part of such hedging transactions that is not effective in offsetting undesired changes in commodity prices the ineffective portion is required to be recognized currently in earnings  our financial statements may reflect a gain or loss arising from an exposure to commodity prices for which we are unable to enter into a completely effective hedge 
for example  when we purchase a commodity at one location and sell it at another  we may be unable to hedge completely our exposure to a differential in the price of the product between these two locations  accordingly  our financial statements may reflect some volatility due to these hedges 
for more information on our hedging activities  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report

segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses because our partnership agreement requires us to distribute of our available cash to our partners on a quarterly basis available cash as defined in our partnership agreement generally consists of all our cash receipts  less cash disbursements and changes in reserves  we consider each period s earnings before all non cash depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses  including amortization of excess cost of equity investments  to be an important measure of our success in maximizing returns to our partners 
we also use segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses defined in the table above and sometimes referred to in this report as ebda internally as a measure of profit and loss used for evaluating segment performance and for deciding how to allocate resources to our five reportable business segments

combined  the certain items described in the footnotes to the table above decreased segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses by million in  million in  and million in  and decreased revenues by million in following is information related to the remaining increases and decreases in the segment s i earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses  and ii operating revenues in both and  when compared to the respective prior year year ended december  versus year ended december  ebda increase decrease revenues increase decrease in millions  except percentages pacific operations southeast terminals west coast terminals plantation pipeline central florida pipeline cochin pipeline all others including eliminations total products pipelines the primary increases and decreases in our products pipelines business segment s earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in compared to were attributable to the following a million increase in earnings from our pacific operations due largely to a million increase in operating revenues  consisting of a million increase in mainline delivery revenues and a million increase in fee based terminal revenues 
the increase in pipeline delivery revenues was attributable to higher average tariff rates in due in part to ferc approved rate increases and to military tender rate increases 
overall mainline delivery volumes were essentially flat across both years 
the increase in terminal revenues was mainly attributable to incremental ethanol handling services that were due in part to mandated increases in ethanol blending rates in california since the end of for all segment assets combined  ethanol volumes handled increased in  a million increase in earnings from our southeast terminal operations due to both increased ethanol throughput  driven by continued high demand in the ethanol and biofuels markets  and higher product inventory gains relative to the prior year  a million increase in earnings from our west coast terminal operations driven by higher warehousing revenues and incremental customers at our combined carson los angeles harbor terminal system  incremental biodiesel revenues from our liquids facilities located in portland  oregon  and incremental earnings contributions from the terminals portland  oregon airport pipeline  which was acquired on july   a million increase in earnings from our owned plantation pipe line company due to higher net income earned by plantation in the increase in plantation s earnings on a basis was driven by both higher products transportation revenues and higher oil loss allowance revenues 
the increase in transportation revenues was due to an overall increase in pipeline throughput volumes in  due in part to an upgrade at a refinery in louisiana and to mainline allocation on a competing pipeline 
the increase in oil loss allowance revenues was associated with the increase in volumes and an increase in products prices  relative to the prior year  a million increase in earnings from our central florida pipeline due mainly to incremental product inventory gains and partly to higher ethanol handling revenues  and a million decrease in earnings from our cochin pipeline system attributable to a million drop in revenues and a million increase in operating expenses 
the lower revenues reflected a decline in system delivery volumes  which resulted mainly from lower propane volumes due to milder weather  a drop in grain drying demand  and to the negative impacts from unfavorable tariff changes in the decrease in earnings from higher operating expenses was primarily related to favorable settlements reached in the first quarter of with the seller of the remaining approximate interest in the cochin pipeline system that we purchased on january  year ended december  versus year ended december  ebda increase decrease revenues increase decrease in millions  except percentages pacific operations west coast terminals central florida pipeline transmix operations plantation pipeline calnev pipeline all others including eliminations total products pipelines all of the assets and operations included in our products pipelines business segment reported higher earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in  when compared to  and the primary increases and decreases in earnings were attributable to the following a million increase in earnings from our pacific operations driven by an million decrease in combined operating expenses and a million increase in total operating revenues  relative to the decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to i overall cost reductions due in part to a decrease in overall mainline delivery volumes and delays in certain non critical spending  ii lower fuel and power  and outside services expenses  iii higher product gains  iv lower right of way and environmental expenses  and v lower legal expenses due in part to incremental expenses associated with certain litigation settlements reached in 
the increase in revenues was driven by higher delivery revenues to us military customers  due to both military tender increases and tariff rate increases which positively impacted our california products delivery revenues  and higher terminal revenues  primarily related to incremental ethanol handling services  a million increase in earnings from our west coast terminal operations largely revenue related  and due in part to the completion of a number of capital expansion projects that modified and upgraded terminal infrastructure since the end of revenues at our combined carson los angeles harbor terminal complex increased million  due mainly to increased warehouse charges escalated warehousing contract rates resulting from customer contract revisions made since the end of and to year over year customer growth including incremental terminaling for us defense fuel services 
revenues from our remaining west coast facilities increased million  due mostly to additional throughput and storage services associated with renewable fuels both ethanol and biodiesel  a million increase in earnings from our central florida pipeline driven by incremental ethanol revenues and higher refined products delivery revenues 
the increase from ethanol handling resulted from completed capital expansion projects that provided ethanol storage and terminal service beginning in mid april at our tampa and orlando terminals 
the increase in pipeline delivery revenues was driven by higher average transportation rates that reflect two separate mid year tariff rate increases that became effective july  and  a million increase in earnings from our transmix operations mainly due to a combined million increase in revenues  recognized in august  that was associated with certain true ups related to transmix settlement gains including tank gains and incremental loss allowance gains  a million increase in earnings from our equity ownership in plantation pipe line company 
plantation s net income on a basis increased in as a result of both higher pipeline transportation revenues and higher other non operating income 
the increase in transportation revenues was due to higher volumes and higher average tariffs  and the increase in other income was due largely to insurance reimbursements related to the settlement of certain previous environmental matters 
the overall million decrease in revenues associated with our investment in plantation was mainly due to a restructuring of the plantation operating agreement between exxonmobil and us 
on january   both parties agreed to reduce the fixed operating fees we earn from operating the pipeline and to charge pipeline operating expenses directly to plantation 
the change had a minimal impact to our earnings  as the drop in revenues was more than offset by a corresponding million decrease in combined operating expenses  and a million increase in earnings from our calnev pipeline driven by a million reduction in combined fuel and power expenses 
the drop in fuel and power expenses was due primarily to an overall decrease in refined products delivery volumes in  chiefly due to lower diesel volumes

the overall increase in our natural gas pipelines business segment s earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in compared to was driven by incremental contributions from both our kinder morgan natural gas treating operations and our owned kinderhawk field services llc  and by the inclusion of a full year of operations from both our owned midcontinent express pipeline system and our fully owned kinder morgan louisiana pipeline system 
we acquired the majority of our kinder morgan natural gas treating operations from crosstex energy  inc on october   and we acquired the remaining portion from gas chill  inc on september  the business consists of multiple natural gas treating plants  predominantly located in texas and louisiana  which are used to remove impurities and liquids from natural gas in order to meet pipeline quality specifications

the increase in earnings from our equity investment in the midcontinent express pipeline system was due to the inclusion of a full year of operations in and to an expansion of natural gas transportation service since the end of midcontinent express system initiated interim natural gas transportation service for its zone pipeline segment on april   achieved full zone service on may   and achieved full zone service on august  in addition  in june  midcontinent express completed two natural gas compression projects that increased zone capacity from to billion cubic feet per day  and zone capacity from to billion cubic feet per day 
the incremental capacity is fully subscribed with ten year binding shipper agreements 
we commenced limited natural gas transportation service on our kinder morgan louisiana natural gas pipeline system in april  and we completed construction and began full transportation service on the system s remaining portions on june  for the comparable periods of and  the increase in earnings consisted of a million increase in system operating income revenues less operating expenses  due mainly to incremental transportation service  and a million decrease in non operating other income  primarily due to higher non operating other income realized in pursuant to ferc regulations governing allowances for capital funds that are used for pipeline construction costs an equity cost of capital allowance 
other year to year increases and decreases in segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in versus included the following an million increase in earnings from our casper douglas gas processing operations primarily attributable to higher natural gas processing spreads  resulting from higher percentage increases in natural gas liquids prices impacting sales relative to percentage increases in natural gas prices impacting costs of sales 
the million year to year increase in revenues was driven by both a increase in natural gas liquids sales volumes and a increase in average natural gas liquids sales prices  when compared to  a million decrease in earnings from our kinder morgan interstate gas transmission pipeline system driven by a million decrease due to lower margins on operational sales of natural gas  and a million decrease due to lower pipeline net fuel recoveries 
both decreases in earnings were due mainly to lower average natural gas prices in kmigt s operational gas sales are primarily made possible by both collection of fuel in kind pursuant to its currently effective gas transportation tariff  and by recoveries of cushion gas  a million overall decrease in earnings from our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group driven by i a million decrease in earnings from overall storage activities primarily due to lower price spreads due to unfavorable market conditions relative to  ii a million decrease from lower interest income  due to a one time natural gas loan to a single customer in  iii a million decrease due to lower natural gas gains primarily due to volume measurement gains related to the normal tracking of natural gas throughout the pipeline system  and iv a million decrease in natural gas sales margins  largely attributable to higher costs of natural gas supplies relative to sales prices and less favorable market conditions 
the overall decrease in earnings in versus was partially offset by a million increase in earnings due to higher natural gas processing margins  due mainly to higher natural gas liquids prices relative to  and a million increase in earnings due to incremental equity earnings from our owned endeavor gathering llc  acquired effective november   and a million decrease in earnings from our owned rockies express pipeline system reflecting lower net income earned by rockies express pipeline llc 
compared to the prior year  rockies express net income on a basis dropped million in  when compared to the overall decrease in earnings consisted of i a million decrease primarily related to higher interest expenses  net of interest income  and ii a million increase from higher system operating income 
the increase in interest expenses was due to higher non cash allowances for borrowed funds used during construction in which reduces interest expenses  and to debt obligations shifting from short term to long term at higher interest rates in the increase in operating income was driven by incremental transportation service revenues related to the completion and start up of the rockies express east pipeline segment  the third and final phase of the rockies express system

the overall increase in the segment s earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in compared to was driven by incremental contributions from our kinder morgan louisiana pipeline system and our equity investments in the midcontinent express and rockies express pipeline systems 
for the kinder morgan louisiana and midcontinent express pipelines  the year to year increases in earnings were due mainly to the commencement and or expansion of natural gas transportation service since the end of  as described above 
for rockies express  the increase in earnings was driven by higher equity earnings from both the completion and start up of the rockies express east pipeline segment  described above  and the inclusion of a full year of operations from the rockies express west pipeline segment  which began initial pipeline service on january   and began full operations on may  the overall increase in earnings in versus was partly offset by a decrease in equity earnings due to approximately miles of the rockies express east pipeline segment being shutdown due to a pipeline girth weld failure that occurred on november  the rockies express east line was repaired following coordination with the us department of transportation and the affected segment returned to reduced capacity on january  rockies express east returned to full service on february   and we estimate the negative impact on our equity earnings from the pipeline s failure in the fourth quarter of was approximately million 
following is information on other year over year increases and decreases in segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in compared to a million increase in earnings from our kinder morgan interstate gas transmission pipeline system driven by higher margins on operational gas sales  higher firm transportation demand fees resulting from both system expansions and incremental ethanol customers  and higher pipeline fuel recoveries 
the system s operational gas sales are primarily made possible by its collection of fuel in kind pursuant to its transportation tariffs and its recovery of storage cushion gas volumes  incremental earnings of million from our kinder morgan natural gas treating operations acquired effective october  and discussed above  a million decrease in earnings from our transcolorado pipeline system primarily due to a million drop in natural gas transportation revenues  and partly due to increases in both pipeline remediation expenses and property tax expenses 
the decrease in transportation revenues related primarily to the negative impact caused by the increased transportation service offered by a competing pipeline in  and a million decrease in earnings from our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group mainly attributable to i lower margins from natural gas sales  primarily due to lower sales volumes and higher average supply prices relative to average sales prices 
the increase in supply prices resulted from a decline in field volumes being replaced with more expensive supplies from more liquid supply locations in  ii lower natural gas processing margins  due to unfavorable gross processing spreads as a result of significantly lower average natural gas liquids prices  and iii higher system operating expenses  due primarily to higher pipeline integrity expenses 
the overall decrease in earnings was partially offset by higher natural gas storage margins  which resulted from favorable proprietary and fee based storage activities and from the leasing of additional storage capacity to customers due to completed capital expansion projects since the end of the overall changes in both segment revenues and segment operating expenses which include natural gas costs of sales in both pairs of comparable years primarily relate to the natural gas purchase and sale activities of our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group  with the variances from year to year in both revenues and operating expenses mainly due to corresponding changes in the intrastate group s average prices and volumes for natural gas purchased and sold 
our intrastate group both purchases and sells significant volumes of natural gas  which is often stored and or transported on its pipelines  and because the group generally sells natural gas in the same price environment in which it is purchased  the increases and decreases in its natural gas sales revenues are largely offset by corresponding increases and decreases in its natural gas purchase costs

combined  the certain items described in the footnotes to the table above increased both segment revenues and segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses by million in  decreased both revenues and earnings by million in  and decreased earnings by million in for each of the segment s two primary businesses  following is information related to the remaining increases and decreases in the segment s i earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses  and ii operating revenues in both and  when compared to the respective prior year year ended december  versus year ended december  ebda increase decrease revenues increase decrease in millions  except percentages oil and gas producing activities sales and transportation activities intrasegment eliminations total co the segment s overall increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in compared to was due to higher earnings from both its oil and gas producing activities and its sales and transportation activities 
the year over year increase in earnings from oil and gas producing activities  which include the operations associated with ownership interests in oil producing fields and natural gas processing plants  was due mainly to the following a million increase due to higher operating revenues driven by a million increase in combined crude oil and natural gas plant product sales revenues  due largely to increases of and in our realized weighted average price per barrel of crude oil and natural gas liquids  respectively  and partly to a increase in natural gas liquids sales volumes 
the overall increase in sales revenues was somewhat offset by a decline in crude oil sales volumes in  and a million decrease due to higher combined operating expenses driven by a million increase in tax expenses  other than income tax expenses  and a million increase in operating and maintenance expenses 
the increase in other tax expenses  relative to  was due primarily to a million reduction in severance tax expenses in due to prior year overpayments 
the increase in operating expenses was mainly due to higher natural gas processing costs related to an increase in processing volumes  and to higher carbon dioxide purchase costs related to higher rates 
similarly  the year over year increase in earnings from the segment s sales and transportation activities in was also primarily revenue related  chiefly due to a million increase in carbon dioxide sales revenues 
the increase was mainly price related  driven by a increase in the average sales price for carbon dioxide 
although our carbon dioxide sales volumes were essentially unchanged across both years  we benefitted from higher average carbon dioxide sales prices in versus due to both continued strong customer demand for carbon dioxide s use in oil recovery projects throughout the permian basin area and to the positive impact on the portion of our carbon dioxide sales contracts that are tied to crude oil prices  which increased since the end of pipeline revenues from transporting both carbon dioxide and crude oil were essentially flat across and  and for our co segment combined  total carbon dioxide delivery volumes decreased almost in versus the decrease in delivery volumes was mainly due to our lower consumption of new carbon dioxide at both the sacroc and yates field units  however  carbon dioxide production from our southwest colorado source fields increased in  and carbon dioxide delivery volumes on our owned cortez pipeline increased by in  both reflecting a slight increase in third party sales compared to our sales and transportation activities also benefitted from a million decrease in income tax expenses in versus  primarily due to favorable adjustments to the segment s accrued texas margin tax liabilities due to prior year overpayments 
year ended december  versus year ended december  ebda increase decrease revenues increase decrease in millions  except percentages oil and gas producing activities sales and transportation activities intrasegment eliminations total co higher year over year earnings from the segment s oil and gas producing activities in more than offset lower earnings from its sales and transportation activities 
generally  earnings from oil and gas producing activities align closely with revenues earned from both crude oil and natural gas plant products sales  but the million increase in earnings in was primarily due to the following a million increase from lower operating expenses consisting of i a million decrease in oil and gas related field operating and maintenance expenses  costs of sales and fuel and power expenses  and ii a million decrease in taxes  other than income tax expenses 
the decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to i lower prices charged by the industry s material and service providers for items such as outside services  maintenance  and well workover services  which impacted rig costs  other materials and services  and capital and exploratory costs  ii lower fuel and utility rates  and iii the successful negotiation and renewal of lower priced service and supply contracts since the end of the decrease in other tax expenses was driven by a decrease in severance tax expenses  related both to lower revenues discussed following and favorable adjustments in to accrued severance tax liabilities  due to prior year overpayments  and a million decrease from lower oil and gas related revenues due primarily to a million decrease in natural gas liquids sales revenues and a million increase in crude oil sales revenues 
the overall decrease in natural gas liquids sales revenues resulted from a decrease in the realized weighted average price per barrel of liquids in  partly offset by an increase in revenues resulting from a increase in natural gas liquids sales volumes 
the year over year volume increase was due in part to the negative impact on sales volumes in from hurricane ike 
hurricane ike  which made landfall at galveston  texas on september   temporarily shut down third party fractionation facilities  which caused a decline in natural gas liquids production volumes in and around the permian basin area through the end of november the million increase in crude oil sales revenues in versus was driven by a corresponding increase in crude oil sales volumes 
as a result of our hedging activity  our realized weighted average price per barrel of oil was essentially flat across both and  although average industry price levels for crude oil increased during the million decrease in the segment s sales and transportation earnings in compared to was driven by a million drop in revenues  including both a million decrease in carbon dioxide sales revenues and a million decrease in carbon dioxide and crude oil pipeline transportation revenues 
the decrease in carbon dioxide sales revenues was entirely price related  as the segment s average price received from carbon dioxide sales in decreased compared to the prior year  reducing revenues by million 
the decrease resulting from the unfavorable price change more than offset a million increase in carbon dioxide sales revenues resulting from higher sales volumes 
total carbon dioxide sales volumes increased by in  due both to carbon dioxide expansion projects completed since the end of  and to continued strong demand for carbon dioxide from tertiary oil recovery projects 
the decrease in carbon dioxide and crude oil pipeline transportation revenues in versus was mainly due to lower carbon dioxide transportation revenues from our central basin pipeline  and lower crude oil transportation revenues from our wink pipeline 
central basin s revenues were negatively impacted by lower weighted average transportation rates  due partly to the fact that a portion of its carbon dioxide transportation contracts is indexed to oil prices  which were lower in wink s drop in revenues in was primarily due to lower pipeline loss allowance revenues  also resulting from lower market prices for crude oil relative to for more information on our ownership interests in the net quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and our measures of discounted future net cash flows from oil and gas reserves  please see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report

the increase in earnings from our west region terminals was driven by incremental contributions from i our vancouver wharves bulk marine terminal  located on the north shore of vancouver  british columbia  canada s main harbor  ii our kinder morgan north terminal  the crude oil tank farm we constructed near edmonton  alberta  canada  iii our washington state terminals located in vancouver and longview  washington  and iv our portland  oregon bulk terminal 
the combined increase in earnings was mainly due to higher transfer volumes of agricultural products and other bulk and liquids commodities  higher rate tonnage  and for our two canadian terminals  favorable currency translation impacts from a strengthening of the canadian dollar since the end of earnings from our southeast  mid river  and ohio valley terminals  which are located in the southeast and central regions of the us  also increased in  due largely to increased steel volumes from rebounding steel consumption consistent with the ongoing economic recovery 
for our terminals segment combined  total steel tonnage increased by million tons in  when compared with the previous year 
the increase in earnings from our ethanol terminals was driven by incremental services offered by our unit train terminaling facilities located at richmond and lomita  california 
in march  we began operations at our newly built richmond terminal  which is serviced by the burlington northern santa fe railroad 
the increase in earnings from our lomita rail ethanol terminal was driven by incremental offloading and distribution volumes  driven by california s growing demand for reformulated fuel blend ethanol 
for our terminals segment combined  ethanol volumes increased by million barrels in  primarily due to the growth in demand from the state of california and to the incremental handling activities from the terminal assets we acquired from us development group llc in january for  earnings from our lower river louisiana terminal operations decreased compared to the prior year 
the decrease in earnings from our lower river terminals was primarily due to lower earnings from both our international marine terminals facility  a multi product  import export facility located in port sulphur  louisiana and owned by us  and our westwego  louisiana liquids terminal 
the decrease in imt s earnings was due to both a general loss in business in  and a million property casualty gain  recognized in  on a vessel dock that was damaged in march in september  imt experienced a catastrophic failure of its shiploader  which negatively impacted its ability to load vessels

the increase in earnings from imt was largely due to both lower year over year operating expenses in  which more than offset corresponding drops in revenues resulting from less dockage  fleeting and barge services  and  as discussed above  a million property casualty gain in the second quarter of the increase in earnings from our geismar facility was due to incremental terminal operations that began in the first quarter of similar to the increase  the increase in earnings from our gulf coast terminals in compared to was driven by higher liquids warehousing revenues  additional liquids storage capacity  and additional ancillary terminal services 
combined  our pasadena and galena park terminals brought an incremental million barrels of liquids tankage capacity including incremental truck loading capacity online during for all terminals combined  total liquids throughput volumes in were higher than  primarily due to both completed expansion projects and continued strong demand for distillate and ethanol volumes 
expansion projects completed since the end of increased our liquids terminals leasable capacity to million barrels at the end of  up from a capacity of million barrels at the end of in addition  our overall liquids utilization capacity rate at the end of decreased by only  when compared to the prior year end 
the increase in earnings in from our west region terminals was driven by incremental earnings from our north and vancouver wharves terminals 
we completed construction and placed our north terminal into service in the second quarter of the increase in earnings from our vancouver wharves terminal was chiefly due to higher liquids revenues  due in part to expanded liquids facilities that began operating in april  and to continued strong ship traffic during at port metro vancouver 
the increase in earnings from our texas petroleum coke operations was driven by higher earnings realized from our port of houston  port of beaumont and houston refining operations 
the combined earnings increase from these operations was driven by higher petroleum coke throughput and production volumes  and by higher handling rates in the increase in volumes was due in part to a new petroleum coke customer contract that boosted volume at our port of houston bulk facility  and in part to the negative impacts caused by hurricane ike in the third quarter of the overall increase in segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to from terminals owned in both comparable years was partly offset by lower earnings from our mid river  ohio valley and materials management terminals 
the decreases in earnings from these facilities were due primarily to lower import export activity and lower overall business activity at various rail and terminal sites primarily involved in the handling and storage of steel and alloy products 
due to the economic downturn that intensified in the last half of  we experienced significant year over year volume and revenue declines at various owned and or operated terminal facilities in  when compared to for our terminals segment combined  bulk traffic tonnage decreased by million tons in versus  and revenues from terminals owned in both years decreased by million

the overall million increase in trans mountain s earnings in consisted of a million increase due to higher operating income revenues less operating expenses  and a combined million decrease due to both lower income from foreign currency transactions included in non operating other income and higher income tax expenses 
the increase in operating income and related income tax expenses was driven by higher crude oil volumes moving across trans mountain s marine dock located in port metro vancouver system throughput volumes increased by overall compared to the decrease in income from foreign currency transactions was primarily attributable to lower currency gains on trans mountain s outstanding  short term  intercompany interest obligations payable in us dollars

amount includes i a million increase in non cash compensation expense  allocated to us from kmi we do not have any obligation  nor do we expect to pay any amounts related to this expense  ii a million increase in expense for certain express pipeline system acquisition costs  iii a million increase in expense resulting from the write off of certain third party acquisition costs  which under prior accounting standards would have been capitalized  iv a million increase in expense related to hurricane clean up and repair activities  and v a million decrease in expense due to the adjustment of certain insurance related liabilities 
b and amounts include increases in imputed interest expense of million and million  respectively  related to our january  cochin pipeline acquisition 
amount includes i a million decrease in interest expense due to certain non cash trans mountain regulatory accounting adjustments  ii a million increase in imputed interest expense related to our january  cochin pipeline acquisition  and iii a million increase in interest expense related to the proposed settlement of certain litigation matters related to our pacific operations east line pipeline 
c  and amounts include decreases of million  million and million  respectively  in net income attributable to our noncontrolling interests  related to the combined effect from all of the  and items previously disclosed in the footnotes to the tables included in results of operations 
items not attributable to any segment include general and administrative expenses  unallocable interest income and income tax expense  interest expense  and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 
our general and administrative expenses include such items as salaries and employee related expenses  payroll taxes  insurance  office supplies and rentals  unallocated litigation and environmental expenses  and shared corporate services including accounting  information technology  human resources and legal services 
combined  the certain items described in footnote a to the table above increased our general and administrative expenses by million in  million in  and million in for compared to  the remaining million increase in expenses included increases of i million from higher employee benefit and payroll tax expenses  ii million from higher overall corporate insurance expenses  and iii million from higher unallocated legal expenses 
the increase in benefit and payroll tax expenses was mainly due to the overall variability in year over year health and medical costs  higher wage rates and a larger year over year labor force 
the increase in insurance expenses was primarily due to higher expense accruals in  related mainly to year over year increases in commercial property and liability insurance costs  and partly to incremental premium taxes 
the increase in legal expenses was primarily due to higher outside legal services 
the remaining million increase in general and administrative expenses in compared to included a combined million increase due to higher employee benefits and payroll tax expenses  and a million increase due to a drop in capitalized overhead expenses other than benefits and payroll taxes 
the increase in benefits and payroll taxes was due mainly to cost inflation increases on work based health and insurance benefits  lower returns on our pension plan assets  higher wage rates in  and a larger labor force relative to the prior year 
the increase in expense due to lower capitalized expenses was due to lower capital spending in and to fewer overhead expenses meeting the criteria for capitalization 
we report our interest expense as net  meaning that we have subtracted unallocated interest income from our total interest expense to arrive at one interest amount  and after taking into effect the certain items described in footnote b to the table above  our unallocable interest expense increased million in compared to  and increased million in compared to for both pairs of comparable years  the increase in interest expense was attributable to higher average borrowings  and partly offset by lower effective interest rates 
our average debt balances increased in and in  when compared to the respective prior year 
the increases in average borrowings were largely due to the capital expenditures  investment contributions  and external business acquisitions we have made since the beginning of for more information on our capital expenditures  capital contributions  and acquisition expenditures  see liquidity and capital resources 
the weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings decreased in compared to  and decreased in compared to the decreases were due primarily to a general drop in variable interest rates since the beginning of  including decreases in the variable interest rate we paid on the borrowings made under our revolving bank credit facility  and in  under our commercial paper program 
we use interest rate swap agreements to transform a portion of the underlying cash flows related to our long term fixed rate debt securities senior notes into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt  and in periods of falling interest rates  these swaps result in year to year decreases in our interest expense 
as of december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our consolidated debt balances excluding the value of interest rate swap agreements was subject to variable interest rates either as short term or long term variable rate debt obligations or as long term fixed rate debt converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps 
for more information on our interest rate swaps  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
unallocable income tax expenses relate to corporate income tax accruals for the texas margin tax  an entity level tax imposed on the amount of our total revenue that is apportioned to the state of texas 
both the increase in expense  in  and the decrease in expense  in  was due to lower margin tax expense accruals in  relative to both and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests  which represents the allocation of our consolidated net income attributable to all outstanding ownership interests in our operating limited partnerships and their consolidated subsidiaries that are not held by us  decreased in and increased in  when compared to the respective prior year 
both the decrease in and the increase in was chiefly due to the higher net income allocated to the noncontrolling interest in the international marine terminals facility in  discussed above in terminals 
liquidity and capital resources general as of december   we believe our balance sheet and liquidity position remained strong 
we had million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and we had approximately billion of borrowing capacity available under our billion senior unsecured revolving bank credit facility discussed below in short term liquidity 
we believe our cash position and our remaining borrowing capacity allow us to manage our day to day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations  and currently  we believe our liquidity to be adequate 
our primary cash requirements  in addition to normal operating expenses  are for debt service  sustaining capital expenditures defined as capital expenditures which do not increase the capacity of an asset  expansion capital expenditures and quarterly distributions to our common unitholders  class b unitholder and general partner 
in general  we expect to fund cash distributions and sustaining capital expenditures with existing cash and cash flows from operating activities  expansion capital expenditures and working capital deficits with retained cash which may result from including i units in the determination of cash distributions per unit but paying quarterly distributions on i units in additional i units rather than cash  additional borrowings  and the issuance of additional common units or the proceeds from purchases of additional i units by kmr  interest payments with cash flows from operating activities  and debt principal payments with additional borrowings  as such debt principal payments become due  or by the issuance of additional common units or the proceeds from purchases of additional i units by kmr 
in addition to our results of operations  our debt and capital balances are affected by our financing activities  as discussed below in financing activities 
credit ratings and capital market liquidity as part of our financial strategy  we try to maintain an investment grade credit rating  which involves  among other things  the issuance of additional limited partner units in connection with our acquisitions and expansion activities in order to maintain acceptable financial ratios 
currently  our long term corporate debt credit rating is bbb stable  baa negative and bbb stable  at standard poor s ratings services  moody s investors service  inc and fitch inc  respectively 
on february   standard poor s revised its outlook on our long term credit rating to stable from negative  affirmed our long term credit rating at bbb  and raised our short term credit rating to a from a the rating agency s revisions reflected its expectations that our financial profile will improve due to lower guaranteed debt obligations and higher expected cash flows associated with the completion and start up of the rockies express  midcontinent express and kinder morgan louisiana natural gas pipeline systems 
as a result of this upward revision to our short term rating  we currently have additional access to the commercial paper market that was not available prior to this rating change 
therefore  we expect that our short term liquidity needs will be met through borrowings made under our bank credit facility and our commercial paper program 
nevertheless  our ability to satisfy our financing requirements or fund our planned capital expenditures will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the energy and terminals industries and other financial and business factors  some of which are beyond our control 
additionally  some of our customers are experiencing  or may experience in the future  severe financial problems that have had or may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness 
these financial problems may arise from current global economic conditions  changes in commodity prices or otherwise 
we have been and are working to implement  to the extent allowable under applicable contracts  tariffs and regulations  prepayments and other security requirements  such as letters of credit  to enhance our credit position relating to amounts owed from these customers 
we cannot provide assurance that one or more of our current or future financially distressed customers will not default on their obligations to us or that such a default or defaults will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  future results of operations  or future cash flows  however  we believe we have provided adequate allowance for such customers 
short term liquidity our principal sources of short term liquidity are i our billion senior unsecured revolving bank credit facility that matures june   ii our billion short term commercial paper program which is supported by our bank credit facility  with the amount available for borrowing under our credit facility being reduced by our outstanding commercial paper borrowings  and iii cash from operations discussed below in operating activities 
the loan commitments under our bank credit facility can be used to fund borrowings for general partnership purposes and as a backup for our billion commercial paper program 
the facility can be amended to allow for borrowings of up to billion 
for additional information on our credit facility  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
as discussed above in general  we provide for additional liquidity by maintaining a sizable amount of excess borrowing capacity related to our bank credit facility 
after reduction for i our letters of credit and ii borrowings under our commercial paper program  the remaining available borrowing capacity under our credit facility was  million as of december  additionally  i we have consistently generated strong cash flow from operations  providing a source of funds of  million in and  million in  and ii we terminated certain existing fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in both and having combined notional principal amounts of million and million  respectively  and we received combined proceeds of million and million  respectively  from the early termination of these swap agreements 
our outstanding short term debt as of december  was  million  primarily consisting of i million in principal amount of senior notes that mature march  and ii million of commercial paper borrowings 
we intend to refinance our current short term debt through a combination of long term debt  equity  and or the issuance of additional commercial paper or additional bank credit facility borrowings to replace maturing commercial paper and current maturities of long term debt 
our outstanding short term debt as of december  was million  primarily consisting of million in outstanding borrowings under our bank credit facility and million in principal amount of senior notes that matured on november  there were no borrowings under our commercial paper program as of december  we had working capital deficits current assets minus current liabilities of  million as of december  and million as of december  the unfavorable change from year end was primarily due to million in principal amount of senior notes due march  being reclassified from long term to short term debt 
generally  our working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments  timing differences in the collection and payment of receivables and payables  the change in fair value of our derivative contracts and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as a result of debt or equity issuances discussed below in long term financing 
as a result  our working capital balance could return to a surplus in future periods 
a working capital deficit is not unusual for us or for other companies similar in size and scope to us  and we believe that our working capital deficit does not indicate a lack of liquidity as we continue to maintain adequate current assets and committed lines of credit to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due 
we employ a centralized cash management program for our us based bank accounts that essentially concentrates the cash assets of our operating partnerships and their subsidiaries in joint accounts for the purpose of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of borrowing 
our centralized cash management program provides that funds in excess of the daily needs of our operating partnerships and their subsidiaries are concentrated  consolidated  or otherwise made available for use by other entities within our consolidated group 
we place no material restrictions on the ability to move cash between entities  payment of intercompany balances or the ability to upstream dividends to parent companies other than restrictions that may be contained in agreements governing the indebtedness of those entities 
however  our cash and the cash of our subsidiaries is not concentrated into accounts of kmi or any company not in our consolidated group of companies  and kmi has no rights with respect to our cash except as permitted pursuant to our partnership agreement 
furthermore  certain of our operating subsidiaries are subject to ferc enacted reporting requirements for oil and natural gas pipeline companies that participate in cash management programs 
ferc regulated entities subject to these rules must  among other things  place their cash management agreements in writing  maintain current copies of the documents authorizing and supporting their cash management agreements  and file documentation establishing the cash management program with the ferc 
long term financing in addition to our principal sources of short term liquidity listed above  we could meet our cash requirements other than distributions of cash from operations to our common unitholders  class b unitholder and general partner through issuing long term notes or additional common units  or by utilizing the proceeds from purchases of additional i units by kmr with the proceeds from issuances of kmr shares 
our equity offerings consist of the issuance of additional common units or the issuance of additional i units to kmr which kmr purchases with the proceeds from the sale of additional kmr shares 
as a publicly traded limited partnership  our common units are attractive primarily to individual investors  although such investors represent a small segment of the total equity capital market 
we believe that some institutional investors prefer shares of kmr over our common units due to tax and other regulatory considerations  and we are able to access this segment of the capital market through kmr s purchases of i units issued by us with the proceeds from the sale of kmr shares to institutional investors 
for more information on our and equity issuances  including cash proceeds received from both public offerings of common units and our equity distribution agreement  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
from time to time we issue long term debt securities  often referred to as our senior notes 
our senior notes issued to date  other than those issued by our subsidiaries and operating partnerships  generally have very similar terms  except for interest rates  maturity dates and prepayment premiums 
all of our outstanding senior notes are unsecured obligations that rank equally with all of our other senior debt obligations  however  a modest amount of secured debt has been incurred by some of our operating partnerships and subsidiaries 
our fixed rate senior notes provide that we may redeem the notes at any time at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest to the redemption date plus a make whole premium 
for additional information on our debt securities and on our and debt related transactions  including our issuances of senior notes  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
as of december  and  the net carrying value of the various series of our senior notes was  million and  million  respectively  and the total liability balance due on the various borrowings of our operating partnerships and subsidiaries was million and million  respectively 
to date  our debt balances have not adversely affected our operations  our ability to grow or our ability to repay or refinance our indebtedness 
based on our historical record  we believe that our capital structure will continue to allow us to achieve our business objectives 
we are subject  however  to conditions in the equity and debt markets for our limited partner units and long term senior notes  and there can be no assurance we will be able or willing to access the public or private markets for our limited partner units and or long term senior notes in the future 
if we were unable or unwilling to issue additional limited partner units  we would be required to either restrict expansion capital expenditures and or potential future acquisitions or pursue debt financing alternatives  some of which could involve higher costs or negatively affect our credit ratings 
furthermore  our ability to access the public and private debt markets is affected by our credit ratings 
see credit ratings and capital market liquidity above for a discussion of our credit ratings 
capital structure we attempt to maintain a relatively conservative overall capital structure  financing our expansion capital expenditures and acquisitions with approximately equity and debt 
in the short term  we fund these expenditures from borrowings under our credit facility until the amount borrowed is of a sufficient size to cost effectively offer either debt  or equity  or both 
with respect to our debt  we target a debt mixture of approximately fixed and variable interest rates 
we achieve our variable rate exposure primarily by issuing long term fixed rate debt and then swapping the fixed rate interest payments for variable rate payments 
capital expenditures we define sustaining capital expenditures as capital expenditures which do not increase the capacity of an asset  and for the year ended december  our sustaining capital expenditures were million 
this amount included million for our proportionate share of the sustaining capital expenditures of i rockies express pipeline llc  ii midcontinent express pipeline llc  iii kinderhawk field services llc  iv cypress interstate pipeline llc  and v fayetteville express pipeline llc 
for the year ended december   our sustaining capital expenditures totaled million including million for our proportionate share of rockies express sustaining capital expenditures 
our forecasted expenditures for for sustaining capital expenditures are approximately million including million for our proportionate shares of rockies express  midcontinent express  kinderhawk  cypress  and fayetteville express 
generally  we fund our sustaining capital expenditures with existing cash or from cash flows from operations 
in addition to utilizing cash generated from their own operations  both rockies express and midcontinent express can each fund their own cash requirements for expansion capital expenditures through borrowings under their own credit facilities  issuing their own long term notes  or with proceeds from contributions received from their member owners 
similarly  kinderhawk field services can fund its cash requirements for expansion capital expenditures with cash generated from its own operations  through borrowings under its own credit facility  or with proceeds from contributions received from its two member owners 
we have no contingent debt obligation with respect to either rockies express pipeline llc or kinderhawk field services llc  however  we guarantee both of midcontinent express pipeline llc s bank credit facility borrowings and of fayetteville express pipeline llc s bank credit facility borrowings 
for information on our contingent debt obligations  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
all of our capital expenditures  with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures  are classified as discretionary 
our discretionary capital expenditures for each of the two years ended december  and were million and  million  respectively 
the year to year decrease in discretionary capital expenditures was largely due to the higher investment undertaken in to construct our kinder morgan louisiana natural gas pipeline system and to expand and improve our products pipelines and terminals business segments 
generally  we initially fund our discretionary capital expenditures through borrowings under our bank credit facility or our commercial paper program until the amount borrowed is of a sufficient size to cost effectively offer either debt  or equity  or both 
we have forecasted million for discretionary capital expenditures in our budget 
this amount does not include forecasted capital contributions to our equity investees or forecasted expenditures for asset acquisitions 
capital contributions in addition to our discretionary capital expenditures  we contributed a combined million to our equity investees in in  we made equity investment contributions of  million 
the decrease in contributions in was driven by the incremental contributions we made in to rockies express pipeline llc  midcontinent express pipeline llc  and fayetteville express pipeline llc all three reported as investments on our balance sheet and accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
combined  we contributed  million in to partially fund i the respective rockies express  midcontinent express  and fayetteville express pipeline construction and or pre construction costs  and ii the repayment of senior notes by rockies express in august our contributions primarily consisted of a combined million contributed to rockies express pipeline llc and midcontinent express pipeline llc 
fayetteville express pipeline llc funded its pipeline construction costs with borrowings under its own billion  unsecured revolving bank credit facility that is due in may generally  we fund our equity investment contributions through borrowings under our bank credit facility or our commercial paper program 
to the extent these sources of funding are not sufficient  we generally fund additional amounts through the issuance of long term notes or common units for cash 
capital requirements for recent transactions for each of the years ended december  and  our net cash outlays for the acquisition of assets and investments totaled  million and million  respectively 
our cash outlays for strategic business acquisitions primarily consisted of i million for a equity ownership interest in petrohawk energy corporation s natural gas gathering and treating business now kinderhawk field services llc  ii million for three unit train ethanol handling terminals acquired from us development group llc  and iii million for terminal assets and investments acquired from slay industries 
with the exception of the terminal assets acquired from us development group llc  which was partially acquired by the issuance of additional common units  we utilized our commercial paper program to fund our acquisitions and then reduced our short term borrowings with the proceeds from our equity issuances and our may issuance of long term senior notes 
including both the value of common units we issued as consideration in the acquisition of assets and the cash related to acquisitions that we placed in escrow as of december   our outlays for the acquisition of assets and investments totaled  million in our cash payments for acquired assets and investments in included million for our acquisition of the natural gas treating business from crosstex energy lp and crosstex energy  inc  and million for our membership interest in endeavor gathering llc 
we utilized our bank credit facility to fund our significant acquisitions and then reduced our short term borrowings with the proceeds from our issuances of common units and senior notes 
all of our significant and acquisitions are discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report

in june  we paid million to eleven of twelve shippers regarding the settlement of various transportation rate challenges filed with the ferc dating back as early as in may  we made refund and settlement payments totaling million to various shippers in connection with certain east line rate settlement agreements 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was  million for the year ended december   compared to  million for the prior year 
the year to year  million increase in cash due to lower cash expended for investing activities was primarily attributable to the following a  million increase in cash due to lower contributions to equity investees  as described above in capital contributions  a million increase in cash due to lower capital expenditures  as described above in capital expenditures  a million increase in cash due to higher capital distributions distributions in excess of cumulative earnings received in from equity investees  primarily related to the combined million in capital distributions we received from rockies express pipeline llc  midcontinent express pipeline llc and kinderhawk field services llc in  versus the million of capital distributions received in from fayetteville express pipeline llc 
current accounting practice requires us to classify and report cumulative cash distributions in excess of cumulative equity earnings as a return of capital  however  this change in classification does not impact our cash available for distribution 
our returns of capital represent distributions paid out by our equity investees in excess of the income they generated 
our return of capital from fayetteville express represents a reimbursement to us for prior contributions we made to fund its pre construction costs for the fayetteville express pipeline system 
in november  fayetteville express pipeline llc entered into and then made borrowings under a new billion unsecured revolving credit facility due in may it then made distributions to its two member owners energy transfer partners  lp and us to reimburse them for prior contributions  an million decrease in cash due to higher acquisitions of assets and investments  as described above in capital requirements for recent transactions  and a million decrease in cash due to the full repayment received in of a loan we made in december to a single customer of our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities amounted to million in  however  in  we generated  million in cash from our financing activities 
the  million overall decrease in cash inflows provided by financing activities in versus was mainly due to a  million decrease in cash from overall debt financing activities which include our issuances and payments of debt and our debt issuance costs 
the decrease was primarily due to i a million decrease in cash due to lower net issuances and repayments of senior notes  ii a million decrease in cash from lower net borrowings under our bank credit facility  and iii a million increase in cash due to net commercial paper borrowings in we had no commercial paper borrowings as of december  
the largely offsetting increases and decreases in cash from our commercial paper and credit facility borrowings  respectively  were related in part to our short term credit rating upgrade discussed above in credit ratings and capital market liquidity 
all of our and senior note offerings and repayments are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  a million decrease in cash from lower partnership equity issuances 
the decrease relates to the combined million we received  after commissions and underwriting expenses  from the sales of additional common units in  compared to the  million we received in all of our and equity issuances are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  and a million decrease in cash due to higher partnership distributions paid in distributions to all partners  consisting of our common and class b unitholders  our general partner and our noncontrolling interests  totaled  million in  versus  million in for further information regarding our and partnership distributions  see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk generally  our market risk sensitive instruments and positions have been determined to be other than trading 
our exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forward looking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in energy commodity prices or interest rates 
our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur  since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in energy commodity prices or interest rates and the timing of transactions 
energy commodity market risk we are exposed to energy commodity market risk and other external risks  such as weather related risk  in the ordinary course of business 
however  we take steps to hedge  or limit our exposure to  these risks in order to maintain a more stable and predictable earnings stream 
stated another way  we execute a hedging strategy that seeks to protect us financially against adverse price movements and serves to minimize potential losses 
our strategy involves the use of certain energy commodity derivative contracts to reduce and minimize the risks associated with unfavorable changes in the market price of natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil 
the derivative contracts we use include energy products traded on the new york mercantile exchange and over the counter markets  including  but not limited to  futures and options contracts  fixed price swaps and basis swaps 
fundamentally  our hedging strategy involves taking a simultaneous position in the futures market that is equal and opposite to our position  or anticipated position  in the cash market or physical product in order to minimize the risk of financial loss from an adverse price change 
for example  as sellers of crude oil and natural gas  we often enter into fixed price swaps and or futures contracts to guarantee or lock in the sale price of our crude oil or the margin from the sale and purchase of our natural gas at the time of market delivery  thereby directly offsetting any change in prices  either positive or negative 
a hedge is successful when gains or losses in the cash market are neutralized by losses or gains in the futures transaction 
our policies require that we only enter into derivative contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions or similar counterparties based upon their credit ratings and other factors  and we maintain strict dollar and term limits that correspond to our counterparties credit ratings 
while we enter into derivative transactions only with investment grade counterparties and actively monitor their credit ratings  it is nevertheless possible that losses will result from counterparty credit risk in the future 
the credit ratings of the primary parties from whom we transact in energy commodity derivative contracts based on contract market values are as follows credit ratings per standard poor s ratings services credit rating j 
aron company goldman sachs a morgan stanley a deutsche bank a as discussed above  our principal use of energy commodity derivative contracts is to mitigate the market price risk associated with anticipated transactions for the purchase and sale of natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil 
using derivative contracts for this purpose helps provide us increased certainty with regard to our operating cash flows and helps us undertake further capital improvement projects  attain budget results and meet distribution targets to our partners 
we categorize such use of energy commodity derivative contracts as cash flow hedges because the derivative contract is used to hedge the anticipated future cash flow of a transaction that is expected to occur but whose value is uncertain 
cash flow hedges are defined as hedges made with the intention of decreasing the variability in cash flows related to future transactions  as opposed to the value of an asset  liability or firm commitment  and we are allowed special hedge accounting treatment for such derivative contracts 
in accounting for cash flow hedges  gains and losses on the derivative contracts are reported in other comprehensive income  outside net income reported in our consolidated statements of income  but only to the extent that the gains and losses from the change in value of the derivative contracts can later offset the loss or gain from the change in value of the hedged future cash flows during the period in which the hedged cash flows affect net income 
that is  for cash flow hedges  all effective components of the derivative contracts gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income loss  pending occurrence of the expected transaction 
other comprehensive income loss consists of those financial items that are included within accumulated other comprehensive loss in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets but not included in our net income portions attributable to our noncontrolling interests are included within noncontrolling interests and are not included in our net income 
thus  in highly effective cash flow hedges  where there is no ineffectiveness  other comprehensive income changes by exactly as much as the derivative contracts and there is no impact on earnings until the expected transaction occurs 
all remaining gains and losses on the derivative contracts the ineffective portion are included in current net income 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative contracts is the difference between the gain or loss from the change in value of the derivative contract and the effective portion of that gain or loss 
in addition  when the hedged forecasted transaction does take place and affects earnings  the effective part of the hedge is also recognized in the income statement  and the earlier recognized effective amounts are removed from accumulated other comprehensive loss and noncontrolling interests and are transferred to the income statement as well  effectively offsetting the changes in cash flows stemming from the hedged risk 
if the forecasted transaction results in an asset or liability  amounts should be reclassified into earnings when the asset or liability affects earnings through cost of sales  depreciation  interest expense  etc 
for more information on our other comprehensive income loss and our accumulated other comprehensive loss  see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we measure the risk of price changes in the natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil markets utilizing a value at risk model 
value at risk is a statistical measure estimating the probability of portfolio losses over a given holding period  within a certain level of statistical confidence 
we utilize a closed form model to evaluate risk on a quarterly basis 
our value at risk computations utilize a confidence level of for the resultant price movement  and we choose a holding period of one day for the calculation 
the confidence level used means that there is a probability that the mark to market losses for a single day will not exceed the value at risk number presented 
for each of the years ended december  and  our value at risk reached a high of million and million  respectively  and a low of million and million  respectively 
value at risk as of december  was million  and averaged million for value at risk as of december  was million  and averaged million for our calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of the reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our combined portfolio of derivative contracts including commodity futures and options contracts  fixed price swaps  basis swaps and over the counter options and corresponding physical commodities assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates  and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated 
actual gains and losses may differ from estimates due to actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures and the timing thereof  as well as changes in our portfolio of derivatives during the year 
in addition  as discussed above  we enter into our derivative contracts largely for the purpose of mitigating the risks that accompany certain of our business activities and  therefore both in the value at risk calculation and in reality  the change in the market value of our derivative contracts portfolio is offset largely by changes in the value of the underlying physical transactions

interest rate risk in order to maintain a cost effective capital structure  it is our policy to borrow funds using a mix of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt 
the market risk inherent in our debt instruments and positions is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates as discussed below 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument  but not our earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument  but may affect our future earnings and cash flows 
generally  we do not have an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on our fixed rate debt until we would be required to refinance such debt 
as of december  and  the carrying values of our fixed rate debt were  million and  million  respectively 
these amounts compare to  as of december  and  fair values of  million and  million  respectively 
fair values were determined using quoted market prices  where applicable  or future cash flow discounted at market rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
a hypothetical change in the average interest rates applicable to such debt for and  would result in changes of approximately million and million  respectively  in the fair values of these instruments 
the carrying value and fair value of our variable rate debt  including associated accrued interest and excluding the value of interest rate swap agreements discussed following  was million as of december  and million as of december  as of december  and  we were a party to interest rate swap agreements with notional principal amounts of billion and billion  respectively 
an interest rate swap agreement is a contractual agreement entered into between two counterparties under which each agrees to make periodic interest payments to the other for an agreed period of time based upon a predetermined amount of principal  which is called the notional principal amount 
normally at each payment or settlement date  the party who owes more pays the net amount  so at any given settlement date only one party actually makes a payment 
the principal amount is notional because there is no need to exchange actual amounts of principal 
a hypothetical change in the weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings approximately basis points in and basis points in  when applied to our outstanding balance of variable rate debt as of december  and  including adjustments for the notional swap amounts described above  would result in changes of approximately million and million  respectively  in our and annual pre tax earnings 
we entered into our interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of transforming a portion of the underlying cash flows related to our long term fixed rate debt securities into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt 
since the fair value of our fixed rate debt varies with changes in the market rate of interest  we enter into swap agreements to receive a fixed and pay a variable rate of interest 
such swap agreements result in future cash flows that vary with the market rate of interest  and therefore hedge against changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt due to market rate changes 
as of both december  and  all of our interest rate swap agreements represented fixed for variable rate swaps  where we agreed to pay our counterparties a variable rate of interest on a notional principal amount  comprised of principal amounts from various series of our long term fixed rate senior notes 
in exchange  our counterparties agreed to pay us a fixed rate of interest  thereby allowing us to transform our fixed rate liabilities into variable rate obligations without the incurrence of additional loan origination or conversion costs 
we monitor our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations in light of changing market conditions and from time to time may alter that mix by  for example  refinancing balances outstanding under our variable rate debt with fixed rate debt or vice versa or by entering into interest rate swap agreements or other interest rate hedging agreements 
in general  we attempt to maintain an overall target mix of approximately fixed rate debt and variable rate debt 
as of december  and  our cash and investment portfolio included million and million  respectively  in fixed income debt securities 
these amounts are included within investments in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets at each reporting date and are not material to our consolidated balance sheets
