the company s success is dependent upon retaining key management personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 
the company is dependent upon its executive officers for strategic business direction and specialized industry experience 
while the company believes that it could find replacements for these key personnel  loss of their services could adversely affect the company s operations 
brookwood s ability to pay cash dividends and tax sharing payments to the company are contingent upon brookwood s compliance with loan covenants required by its revolving credit agreement 
cash dividends and tax sharing payments by brookwood to the company are contingent upon compliance with the loan covenants in brookwood s working capital revolving credit facility with key bank national association 
this limitation on the transferability of assets could adversely affect the company s operations if such payments were restricted 
compliance with corporate governance and disclosure standards is costly 
the company has spent and continues to spend a significant amount of management time and resources to comply with laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including under the sarbanes oxley act of sarbanes oxley  sec regulations and stock exchange rules 
section of sarbanes oxley requires management s annual review and evaluation of the company s internal control over financial reporting and attestations of 
table of contents the effectiveness of these controls by management 
because the company qualifies as a smaller reporting company  the company s independent registered public accounting firm is not required to provide an attestation report 
in early  the company completed its first section report for the year ended december  the company continued to enhance its internal controls and completed its annual review and evaluation of its internal controls and issued its section report for the years ended december   and  in april  march and april  respectively 
however  there is no guarantee that the company will receive management assurance that internal control over financial reporting is effective in future periods 
in the event that the company s chief executive officer or chief financial officer determines that the company s internal control over financial reporting is not effective as required by section of sarbanes oxley  investor perceptions of the company may be adversely affected 
in addition  overhead may increase as a result of the additional costs associated with complying with the complex legal requirements associated with being a public reporting company 
litigation may adversely affect the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the company and its subsidiaries are involved in a number of litigation matters  as described in item legal proceedings of this report 
although the company does not believe that the results of any of these matters are likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows  it is possible that any of the matters could result in material liability to the company 
in addition  the company has spent and will likely continue to spend significant amounts in professional fees and associated costs in connection with these matters 
risks related to our textile products business the company s textile products business may be affected by the following risk factors  each of which could adversely affect the company 
brookwood depends upon a limited number of third party suppliers for raw materials 
brookwood purchases a significant amount of the fabric and other materials it processes and sells from a small number of suppliers 
brookwood believes that the loss of any one of its direct suppliers would not have a long term material adverse effect because other manufacturers with which brookwood conducts business would be able to fulfill those requirements 
however  the loss of certain of brookwood s suppliers could  in the short term  adversely affect brookwood s business until alternative supply arrangements were secured 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any new supply arrangements would have terms as favorable as those contained in current supply arrangements 
some of brookwood s suppliers are entering the military markets in competition to brookwood  targeting specific military specifications 
however  there has been no material effect upon brookwood s business relationship to date 
as of march   brookwood has not experienced any significant disruptions in supply as a result of shortages in fabrics or other materials from its suppliers 
the loss of one or more of brookwood s key customers could result in a significant loss of revenues 
brookwood has several customers who accounted for more than of brookwood s sales in one or more of the three years ended december  sales to one brookwood customer  tennier industries  inc tennier  accounted for more than of brookwood s sales in each of the three years ended december  brookwood s relationship with tennier is ongoing 
sales to tennier  which are included in military sales  were    in  and  respectively  which represented  and of brookwood s sales 
sales to another customer  orc industries  inc orc  accounted for more than of brookwood s sales in and brookwood s relationship with orc is ongoing 
sales to orc  which are also included in military sales  were   and  in  and  respectively  which represented  and of brookwood s sales 
sales to another customer accounted for slightly more than of sales for only 
brookwood s relationship with the customer is ongoing 
sales to that customer  which are also included in military sales  were  in  which represented of brookwood s sales 
military sales were   and  in  and  respectively  which represented  and of brookwood s sales 
while brookwood has enjoyed substantial growth in its military business  there is no assurance this trend will continue 
brookwood s sales to the customers from whom it derives its military business have been volatile and difficult to predict  a trend the company believes will continue 
in recent years  orders from the military for goods generally were significantly affected by the 
table of contents increased activity of the us military 
if this activity does not continue or declines  then orders from the military generally  including orders for brookwood s products  may be similarly affected 
changes in military procurement practices or regulations could adversely affect brookwood s business 
from time to time  the military limits orders for existing products and adopts revised specifications for new products to replace the products for which brookwood s customers have been suppliers 
the us government released orders in recent years that include brookwood s products  which resulted in substantial military sales 
changes in specifications or orders present a potential opportunity for additional sales  however  it is a continuing challenge to adjust to changing specifications and production requirements 
brookwood has regularly conducted research and development on various processes and products intended to comply with the revised specifications and participates in the bidding process for new military products 
however  to the extent brookwood s products are not included in future purchases by the us government for any reason  brookwood s sales could be adversely affected 
a provision of us federal law  known as the berry amendment  generally requires the department of defense to give preference in procurement to domestically produced products  including textiles 
brookwood s sales of products to the us military market is highly dependent upon the continuing application and enforcement of the berry amendment by the us government 
in addition  the us government is releasing contracts for shorter periods than in the past 
the company acknowledges the unpredictability in revenues and margins due to military sales and is unable at this time to predict future sales trends 
global capital and credit market conditions could have a material adverse effect on brookwood s business  operating results and financial condition 
the financial instruments that potentially subject brookwood to concentration of credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable 
brookwood grants credit to customers based on an evaluation of the customer s financial condition 
exposure to losses on receivables is principally dependent on each customer s financial condition 
brookwood manages its exposure to credit risks through credit approvals  credit limits  monitoring procedures and the use of factors 
brookwood continues to monitor its customers and the effect the current economic conditions may have upon their ability to fulfill their obligations to brookwood in a timely manner 
as of march   brookwood s key customers were complying with their payment terms 
brookwood maintains factoring agreements which provide that receivables resulting from credit sales to customers  excluding the us government  may be sold to the factor  subject to a commission and the factor s prior approval 
the amount of receivables that brookwood can factor is subject to certain limitations as specified in individual factoring agreements 
the factoring agreements expose brookwood to credit risk if any of the factors fail to meet their obligations 
brookwood seeks to manage this risk by conducting business with a number of reputable factors and monitoring the factors performance under their agreements 
brookwood continues to monitor its factors and their ability to fulfill their obligations to brookwood in a timely manner 
as of march   all of brookwood s factors were complying with payment terms in accordance with factor agreements 
brookwood s ability to comply with its revolving credit agreement is subject to future performance and other factors 
brookwood s revolving credit agreement requires compliance with various loan covenants and financial ratios  principally i a total debt to tangible net worth ratio of  ii a requirement that net income in each quarter must exceed one dollar and iii a covenant of total funded debt to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  for the trailing four quarters  ratio not to exceed 
brookwood was in compliance with its principal loan covenants as of december   and and for all interim periods during those years 
if brookwood does not comply with these covenants for any quarter  under its working capital revolving credit facility with key bank national association  the bank may require payment of outstanding amounts and prohibit cash dividends and tax sharing payments by brookwood to the company 
primarily as a result of a reduction in the volume of military orders during the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  brookwood s revenue and net income have decreased from the first half of continued compliance with the covenants under its working capital revolving credit facility depend primarily on brookwood s military orders during increasing from the levels in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of brookwood is subject to many environmental regulations that may result in significant costs or liabilities or cause interruptions in its operations 
kenyon and brookwood laminating are subject to a broad range of federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the pollution and protection of the environment 
among the many environmental requirements applicable to kenyon and brookwood laminating are laws relating to air emissions  
table of contents ozone depletion  wastewater discharges and the handling  disposal and release of solid and hazardous substances and wastes 
based on continuing internal review and advice from independent consultants  kenyon and brookwood laminating believe that they are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements 
kenyon and brookwood laminating are also subject to such laws as the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla  that may impose liability retroactively and without fault for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at on site or off site locations 
kenyon and brookwood laminating are not aware of any releases for which they may be liable under cercla or any analogous provision 
actions by federal  state and local governments concerning environmental matters could result in laws or regulations that could increase the cost of producing the products manufactured by kenyon and brookwood laminating or otherwise adversely affect demand for their products 
widespread adoption of any prohibitions or restrictions could adversely affect the cost and or the ability to produce products and thereby have a material adverse effect upon kenyon  brookwood laminating or brookwood 
brookwood does not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on its business  results of operations  financial condition or competitive position as a result of its efforts to comply with environmental requirements 
some risk of environmental liability is inherent  however  in the nature of brookwood s business 
there can be no assurance that material environmental liabilities will not arise 
it is also possible that future developments in environmental regulation could lead to material environmental compliance or cleanup costs 
brookwood s business could lose a significant competitive advantage if it fails to adequately protect its intellectual property rights 
brookwood considers its patents and trademarks  in the aggregate  to be important to its business and seeks to protect this proprietary know how in part through us patent and trademark registrations 
no assurance can be given  however  that such protection will give brookwood any material competitive advantage 
in addition  brookwood maintains certain trade secrets for which  in order to maintain the confidentiality of such trade secrets  it has not sought patent or trademark protection 
as a result  such trade secrets could be infringed upon and such infringement could have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations  financial condition or competitive position 
in july  nextec applications inc filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york claiming that brookwood infringed five united states patents pertaining to internally coated webs 
nextec later added additional patents to the lawsuit 
on april   the court issued its initial order  following a hearing held on february  on various motions for summary judgment filed by both parties 
in the order  the court dismissed nextec s claims for infringement based on seven of the ten remaining patent claims asserted in the action 
on june   brookwood filed a renewed motion for summary judgment with respect to one of the remaining patent claims  which was denied by order entered on march  due to the presence of a disputed issue of fact 
brookwood intends to vigorously defend against any remaining claims 
trial on this matter is currently scheduled to begin on october  refer to item legal proceedings in this report for a further description of this lawsuit 
the strength of brookwood s competitors may impact its ability to maintain and grow sales  which could decrease revenues 
the cyclical nature of the textile and apparel industries  characterized by rapid shifts in military procurement  fashion and consumer demand and competitive pressures  results in both price and demand volatility 
the demand for any particular product varies from time to time based largely upon changes in military specifications  consumer and industrial preferences  and general economic conditions affecting the textile and apparel industries  such as consumer expenditures for non durable goods 
the textile and apparel industries are also cyclical because the supply of particular products changes as competitors enter or leave the market 
brookwood sells primarily to domestic manufacturers  some of which operate offshore sewing operations 
some of brookwood s customers have moved their business offshore 
brookwood has responded by shipping fabric asia to asia and also by supplying finished products and garments directly to manufacturers 
brookwood competes with numerous domestic and foreign fabric manufacturers  including companies larger in size and having greater financial resources than brookwood 
the principal competitive factors in the woven fabrics markets are price  service  delivery time  quality and flexibility  with the relative importance of each factor depending upon the needs of particular customers and the specific product offering 
brookwood s management believes that brookwood 
table of contents maintains its ability to compete effectively by providing its customers with a broad array of high quality fabrics at competitive prices on a timely basis 
there are an increasing number of competitors entering the military market 
these competitors vary and include converters from other market segments  as well as major mills  some of which are brookwood suppliers  who are selectively targeting specific military specifications 
as these companies enter the military market  the competitive pressures may result in further price and demand volatility 
changes in the trade regulatory environment could weaken brookwood s competitive position and have a material adverse effect on its business  net sales and profitability 
imports of foreign made textile and apparel products are a significant source of competition for most sectors of the domestic textile industry 
the us government has attempted to regulate the growth of certain textile and apparel imports through tariffs and bilateral agreements  which establish quotas on imports from lesser developed countries that historically account for significant shares of us imports 
despite these efforts  imported apparel  which represents the area of heaviest import penetration  is estimated to represent in excess of of the us market 
the us textile industry has been and continues to be negatively impacted by existing worldwide trade practices  including the north american free trade agreement nafta  the central american free trade agreement cafta  anti dumping and duty enforcement activities by the us government and by the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies 
the establishment of the world trade organization wto in has resulted in the phase out of quotas on textiles and apparel  effective january  brookwood does not believe these developments will have a material impact on its business 
under nafta and cafta there are no textile and apparel quotas between the us and the other parties for products that meet certain origin criteria 
tariffs among the countries are either already zero or are being phased out 
although these actions have the effect of exposing brookwood s market to the lower price structures of the other countries and  therefore  continuing to increase competitive pressures  management is not able to predict their specific impact 
accordingly  brookwood believes it must fully utilize other competitive strategies to replace sales lost to importers 
one strategy is to identify new market niches 
in addition to its existing products and proprietary technologies  brookwood has developed advanced breathable  waterproof laminate and other materials  which have been well received by its customers 
continued development of these fabrics for military  industrial and consumer application is a key element of brookwood s business plan 
the us government is engaged in discussions with a number of countries or trading blocs with the intent of further liberalizing trade 
authority to negotiate new fast track agreements has been granted by congress  making new agreements in this field more likely 
any employee slowdown or strike or the failure to renew the collective bargaining agreement could disrupt brookwood s business 
although  in  kenyon entered into an agreement for a new three year collective bargaining agreement with local t of the new england joint board of unite here union  representing approximately employees at its rhode island plant facility  effective from march  through february   any employee slowdown or strike or failure to renew the collective bargaining agreement in could adversely affect brookwood s operations 
brookwood s success is dependent upon retaining key management personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 
brookwood is dependent upon its executive officers for strategic business direction and specialized industry experience 
while the company believes that it could find replacements for these key personnel  the loss of their services could adversely affect brookwood s operations 
risks related to the company s investments in financial instruments the company and brookwood invest in cash equivalents and marketable securities that carry investment risk and may incur loss 
as of december   the company and brookwood invested excess cash in a variety of highly liquid cash equivalents  such as money market funds  and certain marketable securities  variable rate demand notes 
although the variable rate demand notes have long term nominal maturity dates  the interest rates generally 
table of contents reset weekly 
despite the long term nature of the variable rate demand notes  the company believes that it has the ability to quickly liquidate these securities  which have an embedded put option that allows the bondholder to sell the security at par plus accrued interest 
while the company and brookwood believe their investments in cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  carry limited risk  no guarantee is made that the investments will be recovered at their full value 
the company s investment activities in the ubs account  which was opened in the first quarter  will be subject to a number of risks  including those described below 
the company will attempt to assess these risk factors  and others  in determining the extent of the position it will take in the relevant securities and the price it is willing to pay for such securities 
however  such risks cannot be eliminated 
the company and its executives have limited experience in investment activities similar to those in which the company intends to engage 
the company has not previously invested in instruments similar to those in which it intends to invest through the ubs account  although mr 
gumbiner  the company s chief executive officer has managed similar investments through other entities with which he is associated 
there can be no assurance that the company s efforts will be successful and there is a risk that the company could suffer significant losses through its investments 
the company s investment activities will be dependent upon one key individual 
the success of the company s investments is expected to be significantly dependent upon the expertise of mr 
gumbiner  its chief executive officer 
the loss of mr 
gumbiner s services for any reason could be detrimental to the company 
the company may change its investment strategy without notice  which may result in it making investments that entail more risk than its disclosed investments 
the company s investment strategy may evolve  in light of existing market conditions and investment opportunities  and this evolution may involve additional risks 
investment opportunities that present unattractive risk return profiles relative to other available investment opportunities under particular market conditions may become relatively attractive under changed market conditions and changes in market conditions may therefore result in changes in the investments targeted 
decisions to make investments in new asset categories present risks that may be difficult for the company to assess adequately and could therefore have adverse effects on the company s financial condition 
a change in the company s investment strategy may also increase its exposure to interest rate  commodity  foreign currency or credit market fluctuations 
the company s failure to assess accurately the risks inherent in new asset categories or the financing risks associated with such assets could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 
the company may invest in foreign securities  which have risks different than those associated with investing in us securities 
the company intends to acquire us and us securities and other instruments  which may be denominated in non us currencies and or traded outside of the united states 
to the extent these positions include non us securities or instruments denominated in non us currencies or are traded outside of the non us  such positions require consideration of certain risks not typically associated with trading united states securities or property 
such risks include unfavorable currency or exchange rate developments  restrictions on repatriation of investment income and capital  imposition of exchange control regulation by the united states or foreign governments  confiscatory taxation and economic or political instability in foreign nations 
in addition  there may be less publicly available information about non us companies than would be the case for comparable companies in the united states  and non us companies may not be subject to accounting  auditing and financial reporting standards and requirements comparable to or as uniform as those of us companies 
the company may incur losses in its investments 
all securities positions taken by the company risk the loss of capital 
the company intends to moderate this risk through a careful selection of securities and other financial instruments 
no guarantee or representation is made that the company s program will be successful 
the company s program may utilize such techniques as trading in derivatives  limited diversification and margin transactions and short sales  which practices can  in certain circumstances  increase the adverse impact to which the company may be subject 
as part of its program  the company may acquire positions in securities and other instruments that may result in significant returns to the company  but that involve a substantial degree of risk 
the company may lose a substantial portion or all of its investment or may be required to accept cash or securities with a value less than the 
table of contents company s investment 
the market prices of the instruments in which the company may invest are also subject to abrupt and erratic market movements and above average price volatility  and the spread between the bid and asked prices of such instruments may be greater than normally expected 
the company s investments may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
the values of certain securities are sensitive to movements in interest rates and  as such  are subject to interest rate risk 
fixed income securities generally decrease in value as a result of increases in interest rates and or spreads 
the company may invest in derivatives  which may increase the risk of the company s activities 
in connection with its activities through the ubs account  the company may invest in derivative instruments 
derivative instruments  or derivatives  include options  futures and other instruments and contracts that are derived from or the value of which is related to one or more underlying securities  financial benchmarks  currencies or indices 
derivatives allow an investor to hedge or speculate upon the price movements of a particular security  financial benchmark currency or index at a fraction of the cost of investing in the underlying asset 
there is no assurance that derivatives that the company may acquire will be available at any particular times upon satisfactory terms or at all 
the value of a derivative is frequently difficult to determine and depends largely upon price movements in the underlying asset 
therefore  many of the risks applicable to trading the underlying asset are also applicable to derivatives of such asset 
however  there are a number of other risks associated with derivatives trading 
for example  because many derivatives are leveraged  and thus provide significantly more market exposure than the money paid or deposited when the transaction is entered into  a relatively small adverse market movement can not only result in the loss of the entire investment  but may also expose the company to the possibility of a loss exceeding the original amount invested 
in addition  the company will be exposed to the risk of non performance of contracts  for financial and other reasons  on the part of counterparties with which the company enters into derivatives agreements 
the company will not be subject to regulatory oversight as an investment company 
while the company s activities in the ubs account may be considered similar to those of an investment company  the company is not registered as such under the ica  in reliance upon an exemption available to companies the primary business of which is other than investing  reinvesting or trading in securities  and  accordingly  the provisions of the ica which among other things  require investment companies to have a majority of disinterested directors  require securities held in custody to at all times be individually segregated from the securities of any other person and marked to clearly identify such securities as the property of such investment company  and regulate the relationship between the advisor and the investment company are not applicable 
because securities of the company held by brokers will generally not be held in the company s name  a failure of any such broker is likely to have a greater adverse impact on the company than if such securities were registered in the company s name 
if the company is deemed to be an investment company  there would be an adverse impact on the company 
the ica defines an investment company as any issuer that is  holds itself out as being  or proposes to be  primarily engaged in the business of investing  reinvesting or trading in securities or any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing  reinvesting  owning  holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding of the value of the issuer s total assets exclusive of united states government securities and cash items on an unconsolidated basis the test 
excluded from the term investment securities are  among others  securities issued by majority owned subsidiaries unless the subsidiary is an investment company or relies on specified exceptions from the definition of an investment company 
the company is a holding company 
it conducts its operations primarily through brookwood  its wholly owned subsidiary 
brookwood is not an investment company under the definition in the ica because its activities and assets consist of its textile products operations 
because the fair market value of the company s assets on an unconsolidated basis substantially exceeds the fair market value of the assets the company intends to hold in the ubs account  and because the company does not intend that investments in securities constitute a business line of the company  the company does not believe that its activities will subject it to regulation under the ica as an investment company 
the company intends to continue to conduct its operations so that it is not required to register as an investment company under the ica and to monitor its holdings regularly to confirm its continued compliance with the test 

table of contents if the company were deemed to be an investment company and required to register under the ica  its activities may be restricted  including restrictions on the nature of its investments 
in addition  the company may have imposed upon it burdensome requirements  including registration as an investment company and reporting  record keeping  voting  proxy and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations  with which it may not be able or willing to comply 
if it were determined that the company was an investment company and failed timely to register under the ica  the penalties and other consequences to the company could be severe 
in order not to be regulated as an investment company under the ica  the company must ensure that it is engaged primarily in a business other than investing  reinvesting or trading in securities and that the company s activities do not include investing  reinvesting  owning  holding or trading in investment securities constituting more than of its assets exclusive of us government securities and cash items on an unconsolidated basis 
the company s business will continue to be in the textile industry  conducted through the ownership and operation of its wholly owned brookwood subsidiary  and not investing  reinvesting or trading in securities 
the company s investments will be subject to the risks of a general market decline 
a decline in the overall market may affect the value of the company s investments 
the company s use of leverage and margin could increase the risks of its investments 
the company may borrow funds to invest through the ubs account or might have long and short positions in excess of the company s net assets in order to be able to increase the amount of funds available for securities investments 
in addition  the company may in effect leverage its investment return with options  forwards and other derivative instruments 
the amount of borrowings that the company may have outstanding at any time may be significant in relation to its capital 
consequently  the level of interest rates  generally  and the rates at which the company can borrow  in particular  will affect the operating results of the company 
in general  the company s anticipated use of borrowings results in certain additional risks to the company 
for example  should the securities pledged to brokers to secure the company s loans decline in value  the company could be subject to a margin call  pursuant to which the company must either deposit additional funds with the broker  or suffer mandatory liquidation of the pledged securities to compensate for the decline in value 
in the event of a sudden precipitous drop in the value of the company s assets  the company might not be able to liquidate assets quickly enough to pay off its debt 
the company may deal with counterparties and custodians who may not properly segregate the company s investments 
there are risks involved in dealing with the custodians or brokers who settle the company s trades  particularly with respect to non us positions 
it is expected that all securities and other assets deposited with custodians or brokers will be clearly identified as being assets of the company and hence the company should not be exposed to a credit risk with respect to such parties 
however  it may not always be possible to achieve this segregation and there may be practical or timing problems associated with enforcing the company s rights to its assets in the case of an insolvency of any such party 
the company may invest in low grade debt securities  which could increase the risk of loss of the investment 
the company may trade in unrated or low grade debt securities that are subject to greater risk of loss of principal and interest than higher rated debt securities 
the company may trade in debt securities that rank junior to other outstanding securities and obligations of the issuer  all or a significant portion of which may be secured on substantially all of that issuer s assets 
the company may invest in debt securities that are not protected by financial covenants or limitations on additional indebtedness 
in addition  evaluating credit risk for foreign debt securities involves greater uncertainty because credit rating agencies throughout the world have different standards  making comparison across countries difficult 
the company may loan or pledge its securities to other parties  which may subject it to the risk of those parties financial condition 
pursuant to master securities lending agreements or similar agreements  the company may lend securities from its portfolio to brokers  dealers and financial institutions and receive collateral in the form of cash and securities in an amount equal to or greater than the current market value of the loaned securities  including any accrued interest or dividend receivable 
the company will retain all rights of beneficial ownership as to the loaned portfolio securities  including voting rights and rights to interest or other distributions  and will have 
table of contents the right to regain record ownership of the loaned securities to exercise such beneficial rights 
such loans will be terminable at any time 
it should be noted that some brokers may lend company securities to third parties without notice to the company or the company and without providing any collateral to the company 
if a broker makes such loans of securities from the company s account  the company may not be able to vote such securities 
in addition  if a broker were to become insolvent in the united states  the company would not have a claim against any specific assets of the broker  but would have a claim against the pool of assets held for the benefit of the broker s customers 
jurisdictions outside of the united states may not provide any similar rights to the company 
risks related to our energy business risk factors for the company s energy business are not provided as the company s involvement in the energy business ceased in following the bankruptcy reorganization of its former energy affiliate  hallwood energy 
in october  the bankruptcy court confirmed a plan of reorganization of the debtors that  among other things  extinguished hallwood energy s general partnership and limited partnership interests  including those held by the company

in april  a claim was filed against  but not served on  the company  each of its directors and hallwood financial in the state district court in dallas county  texas by a purported stockholder of the company on behalf of the stockholders of the company other than hallwood financial 
the plaintiff alleged that in connection with the announcement by hallwood financial that it intended to commence an offer to acquire the remaining outstanding shares of the company s common stock not beneficially owned by hallwood financial  each of the directors breached their fiduciary duties to the minority stockholders  and that the company and hallwood financial aided and abetted that breach

environmental contingencies

such laws and regulations may require the company to secure governmental permits and approvals and undertake measures to comply therewith 
compliance with the requirements imposed may be time consuming and costly 
while environmental considerations  by themselves  have not significantly affected the company s or its subsidiaries business to date  it is possible that such considerations may have a significant and adverse impact in the future

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general 
the company operates as a holding company 
the principal remaining business is in the textile products industry  following the bankruptcy reorganization of its former hallwood energy affiliate in for financial reporting purposes  the company fully consolidates all of its subsidiaries and accounted for the investment in its hallwood energy affiliate using the equity method of accounting 
textile products 
in the three years ended december   the company derived all of its operating revenues from the textile activities of its brookwood subsidiary  consequently  the company s success is highly dependent upon brookwood s success 
brookwood s success will be influenced in varying degrees by its ability to continue sales to existing customers  costs  availability of supplies  its response to competition and its ability to generate new markets and products 
although the company s textile activities have generated positive cash flow in recent years  there is no assurance that this trend will continue 
while brookwood has enjoyed substantial revenues from in its military business  there is no assurance that this trend will continue 
brookwood s sales to the customers from whom it derives its military business have been volatile and difficult to predict  a trend the company believes will continue 
in recent years  orders from the military for goods generally were significantly affected by the increased activity of the us military 
if this activity does not continue or declines  then orders from the military generally  including orders for brookwood s products  may be similarly affected 
military sales of   and  for  and  respectively  were lower in and higher in from the respective previous years 
from time to time  the military limits orders for existing products and adopts revised specifications for new products to replace the products for which brookwood s customers have been suppliers 
the us government released orders in recent years that include brookwood s products  which resulted in substantial military sales 
changes in specifications or orders present a potential opportunity for additional sales  however  it is a continuing challenge to adjust to changing specifications and production requirements 
brookwood has regularly conducted research and development on various processes and products intended to comply with the revised specifications and participates in the bidding process for new military products 
however  to the extent brookwood s products are not included in future purchases by the us government for any reason  brookwood s sales could be adversely affected 
a provision of us federal law  known as the berry amendment  generally requires the department of defense to give preference in procurement to domestically produced products  including textiles 
brookwood s sales of products to the us military market is highly dependent upon the continuing application and enforcement of the berry amendment by the us government 
in addition  the us government is releasing contracts for shorter periods than in the past 
the company acknowledges the unpredictability in revenues and margins due to military sales and is unable at this time to predict future sales trends 
unstable global nylon and chemical pricing and volatile domestic energy costs  coupled with a varying product mix  have continued to cause fluctuations in brookwood s margins  a trend that will potentially continue 
brookwood continues to identify new market niches to replace sales lost to imports 
in addition to its existing products and proprietary technologies  brookwood has developed advanced breathable  waterproof laminate and other materials  which have been well received by its customers 
continued development of these fabrics for military  industrial and consumer applications is a key element of brookwood s business plan 
the ongoing success of brookwood is contingent on its ability to maintain its level of military business and adapt to the global textile industry 
there can be no assurance that the positive results of the past can be sustained or that competitors will not aggressively seek to replace products developed by brookwood 
the textile products business is not interdependent with the company s other business operations 
the company does not guarantee the brookwood bank facility and is not obligated to contribute additional capital 
conversely  brookwood does not guarantee debts of the company or any of the company s other subsidiaries and is not obligated to contribute additional capital to the company beyond dividend payments and the tax sharing agreement

kenyon was closed for a period of seven days after which it reinstituted production of unaffected production lines

brookwood filed claims with its insurance carriers  through its kenyon subsidiary 
brookwood recognized the  insurance policy deductible in the second quarter and has received from its carriers  for its building and contents claims  including  received after december  no additional amounts are due

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the securities and exchange commission sec requested that registrants identify critical accounting policies in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company believes that the following of its accounting policies fit this description revenue recognition 
textile products sales are recognized upon shipment or release of product  when title and risk of loss passes to the customer 
brookwood provides allowances for expected cash discounts  returns  claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt and claims experience and periodic evaluation of the aging of accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of brookwood s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
brookwood may receive instructions from some of its customers to finish fabric  invoice the full amount and hold the finished inventory for delivery at a later date 
in those cases  brookwood records the sale and sends the customer an invoice containing normal and usual payment terms and identifies the inventory as separate from brookwood s inventory 
generally  a customer provides such instructions to accommodate its lack of available storage space for inventory 
this practice is customary in the textile industry and with respect to certain brookwood customers 
in these cases  the brookwood customer either dictates delivery dates at the time the order is placed or when the customer has not specified a fixed delivery date  the customer owns the goods and has asked brookwood to keep them in the warehouse 
for all of its bill and hold sales  brookwood has no future obligations  the customer is billed when the product is ready for shipment and expected to pay under standard billing and credit terms  regardless of the actual delivery date  and the inventory is identified and not available for brookwood s use 
the gross margins 
table of contents on the bill and hold sales held by brookwood at the end of each of the three years ended december  were not material 
deferred income tax asset 
a deferred income tax asset is recognized for net operating loss and certain other tax carryforwards  tax credits and temporary differences  reduced by a valuation allowance  which is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the asset will not be realized 
management is required to estimate taxable income for future years and to use its judgment to determine whether or not to record a valuation allowance to reduce part or all of a deferred tax asset 
management considers various tax planning strategies  anticipated gains from the potential sale of investments and projected future income from operations to determine the valuation allowance to be recorded  if any 
impairment of long lived assets 
management reviews its investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions could negatively affect the fair value of assets and result in an impairment charge 
in the event such indicators exist for assets held for use  if undiscounted cash flows before interest charges are less than carrying value  the asset is written down to estimated fair value 
for assets held for sale  these assets are carried at the lower of cost or estimated sales price less costs of sale 
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques  including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties  present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows  or multiples of earnings or revenues performance measures 
the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques 
significant assumptions used in this process depend upon the nature of the investment  but would include an evaluation of the future business opportunities  sources of competition  advancement of technology and its impact on patents and processes and the level of expected operating expenses 
impairment of investments accounted for under equity method 
investments that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment is believed to have fallen below the company s carrying value 
when such a decline is deemed other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded to the statement of operations for the difference between the investment s carrying value and its estimated fair value at the time 
in making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary  the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline  the investee s financial performance  and the company s ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment s market value 
however  a decline in the quoted market price below the carrying amount or the existence of operating losses is not necessarily indicative of a loss in value that is other than temporary 
all are factors to be evaluated 
differing assumptions could affect whether an investment is impaired 
at least annually  the company performs impairment reviews and determines if a writedown is required 
as application of the equity method of accounting resulted in the carrying value of the company s investment in hallwood energy to be reduced to zero in each of the years ended december  and  impairment reviews were not required for the investments in hallwood energy for those years 
the company s ownership interests in hallwood energy were extinguished in october when the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan of reorganization of the debtors 
in prior years  the company s evaluation of its investment in hallwood energy  or its predecessors  contained assumptions including i an evaluation of reserves using assumptions commonly used in the industry  some of which were not the same as are required by the sec to be used for financial reporting purposes  ii realization of fair value for various reserve categories based upon hallwood energy s historical experience  and iii value per acre in a potential sale transaction  based upon acreage owned in productive areas with shale characteristics similar to acreage previously sold by hallwood energy corporation and hallwood energy iii  lp  former energy affiliates  and other sale activity of acreage with shale formations 
at december   the company does not hold any investments that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
inventories 
inventories at the brookwood subsidiary are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or specific identification method or market 
inventories are reviewed and adjusted for changes in market value based 
table of contents on assumptions related to past and future demand and worldwide and local market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions vary from those projected by management  adjustments to lower of cost or market value may be required 
a reserve for inventory obsolescence is evaluated and adjusted on a quarterly basis 
contingencies 
from time to time  the company  its subsidiaries  certain of its affiliates and others have been named as defendants in lawsuits relating to various transactions in which it or its affiliated entities participated 
the company accrues for losses associated with contingencies when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
management s estimates are subjective based on the status of the legal proceeding  the merit of the defenses and consultation with legal counsel 
in certain matters  it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to estimate the ultimate or minimum amount of that liability until the matter is close to resolution 
as additional information becomes available  management reassesses the potential liability  if any  related to pending claims and may revise its estimates 
due to the inherent uncertainty of the legal process  estimates may be materially different than the actual outcomes  with the result that the company s financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
the policies listed are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the company s accounting policies 
in most cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in the application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result than those recorded and reported 
presentation the company intends the discussion of its financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding its financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain accounting principles  policies and estimates affect its financial statements
