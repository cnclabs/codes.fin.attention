item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions  except per share amounts revenues operating expenses manufacturing cost of sales selling and administrative expenses special charges net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations for manufacturing group diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was a year marked by continued global and economic challenges and yet also was a year in which we made significant progress with cost initiatives  strengthened our overall capital position and had strong execution that allowed us to deliver improved financial results 
cash generated from our manufacturing businesses enabled us to continue to invest in products and technologies that will position us for future growth as the economy recovers 
we completed our restructuring program in  which has driven out costs in all of our segments 
since the inception of the program in late  we have lowered our headcount by and have exited facilities 
during  we continued to make significant progress in our plan to exit the non captive commercial finance business in our finance segment by liquidating a total of billion in finance receivables across the segment  billion of which were receivables in our non captive portfolio  through discounted payoffs  portfolio sales and finance receivable amortization 
our liquidity position strengthened during the year as our businesses generated positive operating cash flow 
as a result  we paid off the manufacturing group s drawn billion credit facility in its entirety and paid down the finance group s billion drawn credit facility by million 
in addition  we strengthened the funding level of our pension plans with a million voluntary contribution in the fourth quarter of revenues dollars in millions revenues change compared with prior period revenues increased million in  compared with this increase was due to significant revenue increases in the industrial  bell and textron systems segments that were largely offset by lower revenue in the cessna and finance segments 
the net revenue increase included the following factors higher revenues of million in the industrial segment  largely due to higher volume reflecting improvements in the automotive industry  bell s revenue increased million  primarily due to higher v and h volume and improved pricing in its commercial business  and textron systems revenue increased million  primarily due to higher uas volume  partially offset by lower revenues at cessna of million  primarily due to lower business jet volume  and a million reduction in finance segment revenues  largely due to lower average finance receivables resulting from the continued liquidation 
in  revenues decreased billion   to billion  compared with this decrease was primarily due to the following factors lower manufacturing volume of billion  reflecting billion decrease at cessna  primarily related to fewer deliveries due to the economic recession  million decrease in the industrial segment  principally due to recession related lower demand  and a million decrease at bell  largely related to lower commercial helicopter volume as a result of the economic recession 
lower finance segment revenues of million  reflecting an increase in portfolio losses  lower market interest rates and lower securitization income  and unfavorable foreign exchange impact of million in the industrial segment  partially offset by higher pricing of million  primarily at bell and cessna 
cost of sales dollars in millions cost of sales change compared with prior period gross margin as a percentage of manufacturing revenues cost of sales as a percentage of manufacturing revenues remained flat at in and on a dollar basis  cost of sales increased million   in  compared with  principally due to the net sales volume changes in the industrial  bell and cessna segments described above  as well as higher pension costs and inflation 
in  favorable conversion costs in the bell and industrial segments  resulting from improved leverage and manufacturing efficiencies on higher volumes  were offset by increased conversion costs at cessna 
conversion costs increased at cessna as cost reduction activities  including workforce reductions and facility consolidations  did not fully offset the impact of lower production volumes 
cost of sales as a percentage of manufacturing revenues increased to in from in on a dollar basis  cost of sales decreased billion   in  compared with  principally due to the sales volume changes in the cessna and industrial segments described above 
in  cost of sales was unfavorably impacted from lower production levels and temporary plant shutdowns in the cessna and industrial segments resulting in increased conversion costs and idle capacity 
selling and administrative expense dollars in millions selling and administrative expenses change compared with prior period selling and administrative expense decreased million   to billion in  compared with  primarily due to million in lower expenses in the finance segment reflecting lower compensation and related costs due to headcount reductions associated with its exit from the non captive commercial finance business  million of lower commissions primarily resulting from lower cessna sales volume  and million lower corporate expenses 
in  selling and administrative expense decreased million   to billion  compared with  primarily due to workforce reductions and furlough programs resulting in lower compensation and related costs  lower sales commissions at cessna  and a decline in professional services and travel costs due to cost reduction efforts 
special charges dollars in millions special charges change compared with prior period in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a restructuring program to reduce overhead costs and improve productivity across the company and announced the exit of portions of our commercial finance business 
this restructuring program primarily included corporate and segment direct and indirect workforce reductions and the closure and consolidation of certain operations throughout the company 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated the final series of restructuring actions under this program  which included workforce reductions in the bell  textron systems and industrial segments and at corporate  along with the decision to exit a plant in the industrial segment 
with the completion of this program at the end of  we have terminated approximately  positions worldwide representing approximately of our global workforce since the inception of the program and have exited leased and owned facilities and plants 
special charges included restructuring charges of million  million and million in  and  respectively  primarily related to severance costs and asset impairment charges 
in  special charges also included a million non cash pre tax charge to reclassify a foreign exchange loss from equity to the statement of operations as a result of substantially liquidating a canadian finance entity 
in  special charges also include a goodwill impairment charge of million in the industrial segment 
in  special charges include an initial mark to market adjustment of million that was made when we classified certain finance receivables from held for investment to held for sale in connection with our decision to sell the non captive portion of our finance business  along with a goodwill impairment charge of million in the finance segment 
interest expense dollars in millions interest expense change compared with prior period interest expense on the consolidated statement of operations includes interest for both the finance and manufacturing borrowing groups with interest related to intercompany borrowings eliminated 
interest expense for the finance segment is included within segment profit and includes intercompany interest 
our consolidated interest expense decreased million   in  compared with  primarily due to a million decrease for the finance group  largely due to the reduction in its debt as it liquidates the non captive commercial finance business 
this decrease was partially offset by higher interest expense for the manufacturing group of million  primarily due to the full year impact in of convertible notes issued in may in  consolidated interest expense decreased million   compared with  primarily due to reduced debt in the finance group as it liquidated receivables 
segment analysis we operate in  and report financial information for  the following five business segments cessna  bell  textron systems  industrial and finance 
segment profit is an important measure used for evaluating performance and for decision making purposes 
segment profit for the manufacturing segments excludes interest expense  certain corporate expenses and special charges 
the measurement for the finance segment includes interest income and expense and excludes special charges 
in our discussion of comparative results for the manufacturing group  changes in revenue and segment profit typically are expressed in terms of volume  pricing  foreign exchange and acquisitions 
additionally  changes in segment profit may be expressed in terms of mix  inflation and cost performance 
volume changes in revenue represents increases decreases in the number of units delivered or services provided 
pricing represents changes in unit pricing 
foreign exchange is the change resulting from translating foreign denominated amounts into us dollars at exchange rates that are different from the prior period 
acquisitions refer to the results generated from businesses that were acquired within the previous months 
for segment profit  mix represents a change due to the composition of products and or services sold at different profit margins 
inflation represents higher material  wages  benefits  pension or other costs 
cost performance reflects an increase or decrease in research and development  depreciation  selling and administrative costs  warranty  product liability  quality scrap  labor efficiency  overhead  product line profitability  start up  ramp up and cost reduction initiatives or other manufacturing inputs 
for the us government business  performance generally refers to changes in estimated contract rates 
these changes typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs to complete a contract that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance on the contract and are recognized by recording cumulative catch up adjustments in the current period

finance segment loss the finance segment loss decreased by million   in  compared with  as the provision for loan losses decreased by million  primarily due to a decline in the accounts identified as nonaccrual during the year  and we had million in lower portfolio losses  net of gains and million in lower securitization losses  net of gains 
these improvements were partially offset by the impact of lower gains on debt extinguishment of million  a million impact from lower interest rates on debt and million in lower accretion of the valuation allowance on finance receivables held for sale 
in addition  as we effected the exit of our non captive finance business  our lower average finance receivables had a million unfavorable impact on segment profit  along with million in lower servicing fees  investment and other income and a million impact related to variable rate receivable interest rate floors 
these factors were partially offset by lower operating and administrative expenses of million  primarily due to lower compensation expense associated with the workforce reduction 
in  the finance segment s loss increased million   compared with  primarily due to a million impact from higher portfolio losses  million in lower securitization gains  net of impairments  million in higher suspended earnings on nonaccrual finance receivables and a million increase in provision for loan losses  partially offset by million in gains on debt extinguishment 
in and  we increased the provision for loan losses significantly in response to the economic recession  declining collateral values and the lack of liquidity available to our borrowers and their customers 
we also increased our estimate of credit losses as a result of our decision to exit portions of the finance business in the fourth quarter of  which we believe will negatively impact credit losses over the duration of our portfolio 
in  the increase was primarily due to an increase in both the rate and severity of defaults resulting from the economic recession and due to declining aircraft values 
the increase was partially offset by a million decrease in the provision for the distribution finance portfolio largely due to the liquidation of of its managed finance receivables in finance portfolio quality the following table reflects information about the finance segment s credit performance related to finance receivables held for investment 
finance receivables held for sale are reflected at the lower of cost or fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and are not included in the credit performance statistics below january  january  dollars in millions finance receivables nonaccrual finance receivables allowance for losses ratio of nonaccrual finance receivables to finance receivables ratio of allowance for losses on impaired nonaccrual finance receivables to impaired nonaccrual finance receivables ratio of allowance for losses on finance receivables to nonaccrual finance receivables ratio of allowance for losses on finance receivables to finance receivables days contractual delinquency as a percentage of finance receivables days contractual delinquency repossessed assets and properties operating assets received in satisfaction of troubled finance receivables at the end of  finance receivables included billion in finance receivables held for investment in the non captive business  compared with billion at the end of in addition  finance receivables held for sale by the non captive business totaled billion at the end of  compared with billion at the end of these decreases were due to the continued exit of this business as discussed above 
nonaccrual finance receivables include accounts that are contractually delinquent by more than three months  unless collection of principal and interest is not doubtful as well as accounts whose credit quality indicators other than delinquency suggest full collection of principal and interest is doubtful 
we believe that the percentage of nonaccrual finance receivables generally will remain high as we execute our non captive liquidation plan 
the liquidation plan is also likely to result in a slower rate of liquidation for nonaccrual finance receivables 
nonaccrual finance receivables decreased million from the year end balance  with a million reduction in the aviation product line  a million reduction in the distribution finance line and a million reduction in the golf mortgage product line 
these net reductions were primarily due to the resolution of several significant accounts through the repossession of collateral  restructure of finance receivables and cash collections  partially offset by new finance receivables identified as nonaccrual in see note to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information on the nonaccrual finance receivables by product line  along with a summary of finance receivables held for investment based on our internally assigned credit quality indicators 
the percentage of contractual delinquency increased primarily due to one significant revolving notes receivable loan in the timeshare product line  which has been classified as nonaccrual since but was not contractually past due until the borrower s bankruptcy filing in  partially offset by a reduction in delinquencies in the aviation and golf mortgage product lines  primarily resulting from the repossession and foreclosure of collateral 
in the timeshare product line  revolving notes receivable loans often remain contractually current despite significant uncertainty regarding the eventual collection of full principal and interest because we are entitled to receive all of the cash flows from the underlying consumer notes receivable  which serve as the collateral for our loan 
see page in note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of delinquencies by aging category 
liquidity and capital resources our financings are conducted through two separate borrowing groups 
the manufacturing group consists of textron inc consolidated with its majority owned subsidiaries that operate in the cessna  bell  textron systems and industrial segments 
the finance group  which also is the finance segment  consists of tfc  its consolidated subsidiaries and three other finance subsidiaries owned by textron inc we designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the finance group 
our manufacturing group operations include the development  production and delivery of tangible goods and services  while our finance group provides financial services 
due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing group s activities  investors  rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each group s performance 
to support those evaluations  we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the consolidated financial statements 
key information that is utilized in assessing our liquidity is summarized below january  january  in millions manufacturing group cash and equivalents debt shareholders equity capital debt plus shareholders equity net debt net of cash and equivalents to capital debt to capital finance group cash and equivalents debt we believe that our calculations of debt to capital and net debt to capital are useful measures as they provide a summary indication of the level of debt financing ie  leverage that is in place to support our capital structure  as well as to provide an indication of the capacity to add further leverage 
we believe that with our existing cash balances  coupled with the continued successful execution of the exit plan for the non captive portion of the commercial finance business  and cash we expect to generate from our manufacturing operations  we will have sufficient cash to meet our future needs 
we maintain an effective shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission that allows us to issue an unlimited amount of public debt and other securities 
we also have credit line facilities available for the manufacturing group of billion and for the finance group of billion  which both expire in april at january   there were no amounts outstanding under the manufacturing group s facility and billion outstanding under the finance group s facility 
during  we liquidated billion of the finance group s finance receivables  net of originations 
these finance receivable reductions occurred in both the non captive and captive finance portfolios but were primarily driven by the non captive portfolio in connection with our exit plan  including million in the distribution finance product line and million in the timeshare product line 
these reductions resulted from the combination of scheduled finance receivable collections  sales  discounted payoffs  repossession of collateral  charge offs and impairment charges recorded as portfolio losses  net of gains in our consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  the reduction in finance receivables included million in the captive finance portfolio  primarily as a result of reduced loan and lease originations and the sale of million of finance receivables 
we measure the success of the exit plan based on the percentage of total finance receivable and other finance asset reductions converted to cash 
in  we had a cash conversion ratio of  compared with in  on our non captive finance receivables 
we expect the cash conversion ratio to continue to decline over the duration of the exit plan due to the change in mix from shorter term assets in the distribution finance product line to longer term assets in the timeshare  golf mortgage and structured finance product lines and the existence of a higher concentration of nonaccrual finance receivables 
at the end of  billion of finance receivables remained in the non captive portfolio 
on may   we issued million of convertible senior notes with a maturity date of may  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
for at least trading days during the consecutive trading days ended december   our common stock price exceeded the conversion threshold price set forth for these convertible notes of per share 
accordingly  the notes are convertible at the holder s option through march  we may deliver shares of common stock  cash or a combination of cash and shares of common stock in satisfaction of our obligations upon conversion of the convertible notes 
we intend to settle the face value of the convertible notes in cash 
we have continued to classify these convertible notes as long term based on our intent and ability to maintain the debt outstanding for at least one year through the use of various funding sources available to us 
manufacturing group cash flows cash flows from continuing operations for the manufacturing group as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized below in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities in the aggregate  cash flow from operating activities in was comparable with  however  our earnings for the manufacturing group  adjusted for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  were stronger in and totaled million  compared with similarly adjusted earnings in of million 
the cash inflow from higher earnings was offset by a million voluntary cash contribution we made to our pension plans in the fourth quarter of  which is included in the accrued and other liabilities line on the consolidated statement of cash flows 
we also used less cash for restructuring activities in  compared with  with cash payments of million  million and million in  and  respectively

our use of working capital improved significantly in  largely related to significant inventory reductions 
investing cash flows in  and primarily included capital expenditures of million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in is largely due to a reduction in discretionary spending due to the economic recession 
in addition  the increase in investing activities in from was primarily due to three acquisitions in the bell  textron systems and industrial segments for million 
in  we paid million for acquisitions  primarily due to transaction settlements related to aai  which was acquired at the end of financing cash flows in primarily consist of the billion repayment of the manufacturing group s bank line of credit 
in  financing activities provided more cash than in  primarily due to the draw of our billion bank line of credit  a portion of which was used to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings  net proceeds of million from the issuance of the convertible notes net of call options  million in cash from the issuance of our common stock and common stock warrants  million in net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and a decrease in dividends paid 
these increases in cash provided in were partially offset by an million decrease in commercial paper borrowings in  compared with an million increase in these borrowings in in addition  we made million in payments to settle advances against our company owned officer life insurance policies in  while in we received million in advances against these policies 
dividend payments to shareholders totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in from payments was due to a reduction in the annual per share dividend to in from in we have not repurchased any of our common stock other than in connection with an executive compensation award since we suspended all share repurchase activity under our repurchase program in september under board authorized share repurchase programs  we spent million in for share repurchases representing approximately million shares of common stock 
capital contributions paid to and dividends received from the finance group under a support agreement between textron inc and tfc  textron inc

due to the nature of these contributions  we classify these contributions within cash flows used by operating activities for the manufacturing group in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
capital contributions to support finance group growth in the ongoing captive finance business are classified as cash flows from financing activities 
the finance group s net income loss is excluded from the manufacturing group s cash flows  while dividends from the finance group are included within cash flows from operating activities for the manufacturing group as they represent a return on investment 
finance group cash flows the cash flows from continuing operations for the finance group are summarized below in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities cash flow from operating activities for the finance group decreased million in  compared with  largely due to million in taxes paid  primarily attributable to a settlement related to the challenge of tax deductions we took in prior years for certain leverage lease transactions 
in  the finance group received a tax refund of million  compared with tax payments of million in  which was partially offset by lower fee income in due to the wind down of the non captive business

cash receipts from the collection of finance receivables continued to outpace finance receivable originations  which resulted in net cash inflow from investing activities in and finance receivables repaid and proceeds from sales and securitizations totaled billion in  billion in and billion in cash outflows for originations declined to million in from billion in and billion in financing cash flows in primarily consisted of the billion repayment of textron inc s bank line of credit and a million payment made on the outstanding balance of the tfc s bank line of credit 
in addition  we made billion in principal payments on our long term debt in in  more cash was used for financing activities as we repaid billion in maturing long term debt  including early debt extinguishments  compared with billion in this use was partially offset by the receipt of billion from drawing on our lines of credit  which was partially offset by a billion decrease in commercial paper borrowings in  compared with a million increase in net commercial paper borrowings in we also made million in payments to settle advances against our company owned officer life insurance policies in  while in  we received million in advances against these policies 
in addition  we used more cash in for stock repurchases and dividend payments  compared with  as discussed in the manufacturing group cash flows section herein 
captive financing and other intercompany transactions the finance group finances retail purchases and leases for new and used aircraft and equipment manufactured by our manufacturing group  otherwise known as captive financing 
in the consolidated statements of cash flows  cash received from customers or from securitizations is reflected as operating activities when received from third parties 
however  in the cash flow information provided for the separate borrowing groups  cash flows related to captive financing activities are reflected based on the operations of each group 
for example  when product is sold by our manufacturing group to a customer and is financed by the finance group  the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing activities as a cash outflow in the finance group s statement of cash flows 
meanwhile  in the manufacturing group s statement of cash flows  the cash received from the finance group on the customer s behalf is recorded within operating cash flows as a cash inflow 
although cash is transferred between the two borrowing groups  there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated cash flows at the time of the original financing 
these captive financing activities  along with all significant intercompany transactions  are reclassified or eliminated from the consolidated statements of cash flows 
reclassification and elimination adjustments included in the consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized below in millions reclassifications from investing activities finance receivable originations for manufacturing group inventory sales cash received from customers  sale of receivables and securitizations other capital contributions made to finance group other total reclassifications from investing activities reclassifications from financing activities capital contribution paid by manufacturing group to finance group under support agreement dividends received by manufacturing group from finance group other capital contributions made to finance group other total reclassifications from financing activities total reclassifications and adjustments to cash flow from operating activities in and  captive finance receivable originations have decreased largely due to lower aircraft sales 
consolidated discontinued operations cash flows the cash flows from discontinued operations are summarized below in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities in  cash flows from investing activities primarily include approximately million in after tax net proceeds upon the sale of hr textron  partially offset by million in tax payments related to the sale of the fluid power business 
in the fourth quarter of  we received net cash proceeds from the sale of the fluid power business of approximately million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for details concerning these dispositions 
contractual obligations manufacturing group the following table summarizes the known contractual obligations  as defined by reporting regulations  of our manufacturing group as of january   as well as an estimate of the year in which these obligations are expected to be paid and in millions thereafter total liabilities reflected in balance sheet long term debt interest on borrowings pension benefits for unfunded plans postretirement benefits other than pensions other long term liabilities liabilities not reflected in balance sheet operating leases purchase obligations total manufacturing group we maintain defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
included in the above table are discounted estimated benefit payments we expect to make related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors  including mortality assumptions  expected retirement age  rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates  which are subject to change in future years 
our policy for funding pension plans is to make contributions annually  consistent with applicable laws and regulations  however  future contributions to our pension plans are not included in the above table 
in  we expect to make contributions to our funded pension plans of approximately million and approximately million in the retirement account plan 
based on our current assumptions  which may change with changes in market conditions  our current contribution estimates for each of the years from through are estimated to be in the range of approximately million to million under the plan provisions in place at this time 
other long term liabilities included in the table consist primarily of undiscounted amounts in the consolidated balance sheet as of january   representing obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and estimated environmental remediation costs 
payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on management s assumptions of expected retirement age  mortality  stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals 
the timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs is largely based on historical experience 
other long term liabilities  such as deferred taxes  unrecognized tax benefits and product liability and litigation reserves  have been excluded from the table due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments combined with the absence of historical trends to be used as a predictor for such payments 
operating leases represent undiscounted obligations under noncancelable leases 
purchase obligations represent undiscounted obligations for which we are committed to purchase goods and services as of january  the ultimate liability for these obligations may be reduced based upon termination provisions included in certain purchase contracts  the costs incurred to date by vendors under these contracts or by recourse under firm contracts with the us government under normal termination clauses 
finance group the following table summarizes the known contractual obligations  as defined by reporting regulations  of our finance group as of january   as well as an estimate of the year in which these obligations are expected to be paid and in millions thereafter total liabilities reflected in balance sheet multi year bank lines of credit term debt securitized debt subordinated debt interest on borrowings liabilities not reflected in balance sheet operating leases total finance group securitized debt payments do not represent contractual obligations of the finance group  and we do not provide legal recourse to investors who purchase interests in the securitizations beyond the credit enhancement inherent in the retained subordinate interests 
interest payments reflect the current interest rate paid on the related debt 
they do not include anticipated changes in market interest rates  which could have an impact on the interest rate according to the terms of the related debt 
on january   the finance group also had million in other liabilities  primarily accounts payable and accrued expenses  that are payable within the next months 
critical accounting estimates to prepare our consolidated financial statements to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  we must make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies 
the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations are listed below 
we believe these policies require our most difficult  subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties 
this section should be read in conjunction with note to the consolidated financial statements  which includes other significant accounting policies 
allowance for losses on finance receivables held for investment finance receivables held for investment are generally recorded at the amount of outstanding principal less allowance for losses 
we maintain the allowance for losses on finance receivables at a level considered adequate to cover inherent losses in the portfolio based on management s evaluation and analysis by product line 
for larger balance accounts specifically identified as impaired  including large accounts in homogenous portfolios  a reserve is established based on comparing the carrying value to either a the expected future cash flows  discounted at the finance receivable s effective interest rate  or b the fair value  if the finance receivable is collateral dependent 
the expected future cash flows consider collateral value  financial performance and liquidity of our borrower  existence and strength of guarantors  estimated recovery costs  including legal expenses  and costs associated with the repossession foreclosure and eventual disposal of collateral 
when there is a range of potential outcomes  we perform multiple discounted cash flow analyses and weight the outcomes based on their relative likelihood of occurrence 
the evaluation of our portfolios is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates  including the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired finance receivables and the underlying collateral  which may differ from actual results 
while our analysis is specific to each individual account  certain critical factors are included in this analysis for each product line  which are discussed in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we also establish an allowance for losses by product line to cover probable  but specifically unknown losses existing in the portfolio 
for homogenous portfolios  including the aviation and golf equipment product lines  the allowance is established as a percentage of non recourse finance receivables  which have not been identified as requiring specific reserves 
the percentage is based on a combination of factors including historical loss experience  current delinquency and default trends  collateral values and both general economic and specific industry trends 
for non homogenous portfolios  including the golf mortgage and timeshare product lines  the allowance is established as a percentage of watchlist balances  which represents a combination of assumed default likelihood and loss severity based on historical experience  industry trends and collateral values 
we classify accounts as watchlist based on credit quality indicators discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in and  net charge offs totaled million and million  respectively  compared with the provision for losses recorded during the periods of million and million  respectively 
finance receivables finance receivables are classified as held for investment when we have the intent and the ability to hold the receivable for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff 
our decision to classify certain finance receivables as held for sale is based on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  contractual duration  type of collateral  credit strength of the borrowers  interest rates and perceived marketability of the receivables 
on an ongoing basis  these factors  combined with our overall liquidation strategy  determine which finance receivables we have the intent to hold for the foreseeable future and which receivables we will hold for sale 
our current strategy is based on an evaluation of both our performance and liquidity position and changes in external factors affecting the value and or marketability of our finance receivables 
a change in this strategy could result in a change in the classification of our finance receivables 
as a result of the significant influence of economic and liquidity conditions on our business plans and strategies  and the rapid changes in these and other factors we utilize to determine which assets are classified as held for sale  we currently believe the term foreseeable future represents a time period of six to nine months 
we also believe that unanticipated changes in both internal and external factors affecting our financial performance  liquidity position or the value and or marketability of our finance receivables could result in a modification of this assessment 
if we determine that finance receivables classified as held for sale will not be sold and we have the intent and ability to hold the finance receivables for the foreseeable future  until maturity or payoff  the finance receivables are reclassified to held for investment at the lower of cost or fair value at that time 
conversely  if we determine that there are other finance receivables that we subsequently determine we no longer intend or have the ability to hold to maturity  these receivables would be designated as held for sale  and a valuation allowance would be established at that time  if necessary 
at january   if we had classified additional finance receivables as held for sale  a valuation allowance would likely have been required at that time based on the fair value estimates we completed for our footnote disclosure requirements 
see page in note to the consolidated financial statements for a table where we have included the carrying value and fair value for the financial assets and liabilities that currently are not recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet 
finance receivables held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value 
there are no active  quoted market prices for our finance receivables 
the estimate of fair value was determined based on the use of discounted cash flow models to estimate the exit price we expect to receive in the principal market for each type of loan in an orderly transaction  which includes both the sale of pools of similar assets and the sale of individual loans 
the models we used incorporate estimates of the rate of return  financing cost  capital structure and or discount rate expectations of current market participants combined with estimated loan cash flows based on credit losses  payment rates and credit line utilization rates 
where available  the assumptions related to the expectations of current market participants are compared with observable market inputs  including bids from prospective purchasers of similar loans and certain bond market indices for loans of similar perceived credit quality 
although we utilize and prioritize these market observable inputs in our discounted cash flow models  these inputs are not typically derived from markets with directly comparable loan structures  industries and collateral types 
therefore  all valuations of finance receivables held for sale involve significant management judgment  which can result in differences between our fair value estimates and those of other market participants 
long term contracts we make a substantial portion of our sales to government customers pursuant to long term contracts 
these contracts require development and delivery of products over multiple years and may contain fixed price purchase options for additional products 
we account for these long term contracts under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under the percentage of completion method  we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenues and cost of a contract 
the percentage of completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and  in some cases  includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications 
due to the size  length of time and nature of many of our contracts  the estimation of total contract costs and revenues through completion is complicated and subject to many variables relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years 
we are required to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as expected engineering requirements  complexity of design and related development costs  performance of subcontractors  availability and cost of materials  labor productivity and cost  overhead and capital costs  manufacturing efficiencies and the achievement of contract milestones  including product deliveries 
our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals 
we update our projections of costs at least semiannually or when circumstances significantly change 
adjustments to projected costs are recognized in earnings when determinable 
anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which the losses become probable and estimable 
due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above  it is likely that materially different revenues and or cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
our earnings could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to earnings if a total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment  b total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation  c there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or d we are unable to meet contract milestones 
goodwill we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances  such as declines in sales  earnings or cash flows  or material adverse changes in the business climate  indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit might be impaired 
goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment using a two step process 
in step  companies are required to estimate fair value of their reporting units  which may be done using various methodologies  including the income method using discounted cash flows 
if its estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value  the reporting unit is not impaired  and no further analysis is performed 
otherwise  the amount of the impairment must be determined in step of the goodwill impairment test 
in step  the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by assigning a fair value to all of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities  including any unrecognized intangible assets  as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at fair value 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
fair values are established primarily using discounted cash flows that incorporate assumptions for the unit s short and long term revenue growth rates  operating margins and discount rates  which represent our best estimates of current and forecasted market conditions  current cost structure  anticipated net cost reductions  and the implied rate of return that we believe a market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed 
the revenue growth rates and operating margins used in our discounted cash flow analysis are based on our businesses strategic plans and long range planning forecasts 
the long term growth rate we use to determine the terminal value of the business is based on our assessment of its minimum expected terminal growth rate  as well as its past historical growth and broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product  inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve 
we utilize a weighted average cost of capital in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit 
we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that an independent investor or market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed 
based on our annual review  the fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values  and we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any units might fail the step impairment test in the foreseeable future 
retirement benefits we maintain various pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally 
these plans include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations  which are calculated based on actuarial valuations 
key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses include expected long term rates of return on plan assets  discount rates and healthcare cost projections 
we also make assumptions regarding employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns  mortality  turnover and rate of compensation increases 
we evaluate and update these assumptions annually 
to determine the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocation  as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class 
a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense 
for  the assumed expected long term rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense was  compared with in in and  the assumed rate of return for our domestic plans  which represent approximately of our total pension assets  was and  respectively 
a basis point decrease in this long term rate of return in would have resulted in approximately a million increase in pension expense for our domestic plans 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date  reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled 
this rate should be in line with rates for high quality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits  which fluctuate as long term interest rates change 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
in  the weighted average discount rate used in calculating pension expense was  compared with in for our domestic plans  the assumed discount rate was in  compared with for a basis point decrease in this discount rate in would have resulted in approximate a million increase in pension expense for our domestic plans 
the trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate  and it has an important effect on postretirement liabilities 
the medical and prescription drug healthcare cost trend rates represent the weighted average annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits 
the medical rate of is assumed to decrease to by and then remain at that level 
the prescription drug rate of is assumed to decrease to by and then remain at that level 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of a one percentage point change in the cost trend rate 
warranty liabilities we provide limited warranty and product maintenance programs  including parts and labor  for certain products for periods ranging from one to five years 
a significant portion of these liabilities arises from our commercial aircraft businesses 
we also may incur costs related to product recalls 
we estimate the costs that may be incurred under warranty programs and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized 
factors that affect this liability include the number of products sold  historical costs per claim  contractual recoveries from vendors  and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims  including production and warranty patterns for new models 
during our initial aircraft model launches  we typically incur higher warranty related costs until the production process matures  at which point warranty costs moderate 
we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty and product maintenance liabilities periodically and adjust the amounts as necessary 
adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and actual experience warrant 
should future warranty experience differ materially from our historical experience  we may be required to record additional warranty liabilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which these additional liabilities are required 
income taxes deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases  as well as from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards  and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered 
deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years 
we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources  including the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  taxable income in carryback years  available tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income 
we recognize net tax related interest and penalties for continuing operations in income tax expense 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which may result in proposed assessments 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
for those tax positions for which it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
interest and penalties are accrued  where applicable 
we recognize net tax related interest and penalties for continuing operations in income tax expense 
if we do not believe that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit is recognized 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities due to closure of income tax examinations  new regulatory or judicial pronouncements  or other relevant events 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risks our financial results are affected by changes in the us and foreign interest rates 
as part of managing this risk  we seek to achieve a prudent balance between floating and fixed rate exposures 
we continually monitor our mix of these exposures and adjust the mix  as necessary 
our finance group limits its risk to changes in interest rates with its strategy of matching floating rate assets with floating rate liabilities 
this strategy includes the use of interest rate exchange agreements 
at january   floating rate liabilities in excess of floating rate assets were million  after considering interest rate exchange agreements and the treatment of million of floating rate loans with index rate floors as fixed rate loans 
these loans have index rates that are  on average  basis points above the applicable index rate predominately the prime rate 
the finance group has benefited from interest rate floor agreements in the recent low rate environment  however  in a rising rate environment  this benefit will dissipate until the prime rate exceeds the floor rates embedded in these agreements 
the net effect of interest rate exchange agreements designated as hedges of debt decreased interest expense for our finance group by million  million and million in  and  respectively 
foreign exchange risks our financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the foreign markets in which our products are manufactured and or sold 
the impact of foreign exchange rate changes for and from the prior year for each period is provided below in millions impact of foreign exchange rates increased decreased revenues segment profit for our manufacturing operations  we manage exposures to foreign currency assets and earnings primarily by funding certain foreign currency denominated assets with liabilities in the same currency so that certain exposures are naturally offset 
we primarily use borrowings denominated in euro and british pound sterling for these purposes 
in managing our foreign currency transaction exposures  we also enter into foreign currency forward exchange and option contracts 
these contracts generally are used to fix the local currency cost of purchased goods or services or selling prices denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
the notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency options was approximately billion and billion at the end of and  respectively 
quantitative risk measures in the normal course of business  we enter into financial instruments for purposes other than trading 
to quantify the market risk inherent in our financial instruments  we utilize a sensitivity analysis 
the financial instruments that are subject to market risk interest rate risk  foreign exchange rate risk and equity price risk include finance receivables excluding lease receivables  debt excluding lease obligations  interest rate exchange agreements and foreign currency exchange contracts 
presented below is a sensitivity analysis of the fair value of financial instruments outstanding at year end 
we estimate the fair value of the financial instruments using discounted cash flow analysis and indicative market pricing as reported by leading financial news and data providers 
this sensitivity analysis is most likely not indicative of actual results in the future
