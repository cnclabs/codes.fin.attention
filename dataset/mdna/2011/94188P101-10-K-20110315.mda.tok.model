item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income and mortgage banking income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  consisting primarily of residential loans  construction loans and debt and mortgage related securities and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  consisting primarily of time deposits and borrowings from the fhlbc 
waterstone bank is primarily a mortgage lender with mortgage loans comprising of total loans receivable at december  further  of total loans receivable at december  were residential mortgage loans of which were one to four family residential mortgage loans and were over four family residential mortgage loans 
waterstone bank funds loan production primarily with retail deposits 
total deposits were of total assets on december  in addition  of total deposits were time deposits  also known as certificates of deposit 
deposits obtained from brokers totaled million at december  waterstone bank uses borrowings from the fhlbc and from other banks as a secondary source of funding 
fhlbc advances outstanding at december  totaled million or of total assets 
two bank lines of credit were used as a secondary funding source for loans held for sale 
outstanding draws on these two lines totaled million as of december  our results of operations also are significantly affected by our provision for loan losses  non interest income and non interest expense 
during the past three years  the significant provision for loan losses has had the greatest impact on our results of operations 
non interest income currently consists of mortgage banking income  service fees  income from the increase on the cash surrender value of life insurance and miscellaneous other income  partially offset by impairment losses on securities 
non interest expense currently consists of compensation and employee benefits  occupancy  fdic insurance premiums  real estate owned expense  data processing  advertising  professional fees and other operating expenses 
our results of operations are also affected by general and local economic and competitive conditions  changes in market interest rates  governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that involve significant judgments and assumptions by management and that have  or could have  a material impact on our income or the carrying value of our assets 
allowance for loan losses 
waterstone bank establishes valuation allowances on loans deemed to be impaired 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that waterstone bank will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
a valuation allowance is established for an amount equal to the impairment when the carrying amount of the loan exceeds the present value of the expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate or the fair value of the underlying collateral 
waterstone bank also establishes valuation allowances based on an evaluation of the various risk components that are inherent in the credit portfolio 
the risk components that are evaluated include past loan loss experience  the level of non performing and classified assets  current economic conditions  volume  growth  and composition of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  regulatory guidance  and other relevant factors 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to earnings and recoveries of previously charged off loans and reduced by charge offs 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is reviewed and approved quarterly by the waterstone bank board of directors 
the allowance reflects management s best estimate of the amount needed to provide for the probable loss on impaired loans and other inherent losses in the loan portfolio  and is based on a risk model developed and implemented by management and approved by the waterstone bank board of directors 
actual results could differ from this estimate  and future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on unforeseen changes in loan quality and economic conditions 
more specifically  if our future charge off experience increases substantially from our past experience  or if the value of underlying loan collateral  in our case real estate  declines in value by a substantial amount  or if unemployment in our primary market area increases significantly  our allowance for loan losses may be inadequate and we will incur higher provisions for loan losses and lower net income in the future 
in addition  state and federal regulators periodically review the waterstone bank allowance for loan losses 
such regulators have the authority to require waterstone bank to recognize additions to the allowance at the time of their examination 

table of contents income taxes 
the company and its subsidiaries file consolidated federal and combined state income tax returns 
the provision for income taxes is based upon income in the consolidated financial statements  rather than amounts reported on the income tax return 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as for net operating loss carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
during  the company recorded net income tax expense of million which included million of additional income tax expense to establish a valuation allowance against the company s net deferred tax asset 
under generally accepted accounting principles  a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management evaluation of both positive and negative evidence  the forecasts of future income  applicable tax planning strategies  and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions 
examples of positive evidence may include the existence of taxes paid in available carry back years as well as the probability that taxable income will be generated in future periods 
examples of negative evidence may include cumulative losses in a current year and prior two years and general business and economic trends 
at both december  and  the company determined a valuation allowance continued to be necessary  largely based on the negative evidence represented by a cumulative loss in the most recent three year period caused by the significant loan loss provisions recorded during those three years 
in addition  general uncertainty regarding the economy and the housing market has increased the potential volatility and uncertainty of projected earnings 
management is required to re evaluate the deferred tax asset and the related valuation allowance quarterly 
positions taken in the company s tax returns are subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination 
the benefit of uncertain tax positions are initially recognized in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
such tax positions are both initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the tax authority  assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
interest and penalties on income tax uncertainties are classified within income tax expense in the income statement 
management believes the company s tax policies and practices are critical because the determination of the tax provision and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities have a material impact on our net income and the carrying value of our assets 
we have no plans to change the tax recognition methodology in the future without hard evidence of sustainable earnings trends which are reliant on net interest income  mortgage banking income and significantly reduced credit losses 
if the estimated valuation allowance against our deferred asset is adjusted it will affect our future net income 
at december  and  there was a valuation allowance of million 
the net recorded deferred tax asset  after valuation allowance was million at december  and million at december  the remaining net deferred tax assets at december  and were primarily supported by available tax planning strategies 
fair value measurements 
the company determines the fair value of its assets and liabilities in accordance with asc asc establishes a standard framework for measuring and disclosing fair value under gaap 
a number of valuation techniques are used to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities in the company s financial statements 
the valuation techniques include quoted market prices for investment securities  appraisals of real estate from independent licensed appraisers and other valuation techniques 
fair value measurements for assets and liabilities where limited or no observable market data exists are based primarily upon estimates  and are often calculated based on the economic and competitive environment  the characteristics of the asset or liability and other factors 
therefore  the valuation results cannot be determined with precision and may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset or liability 
additionally  there are inherent weaknesses in any calculation technique  and changes in the underlying assumptions used  including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows  could significantly affect the results of current or future values 
significant changes in the aggregate fair value of assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value or for impairment are recognized in the income statement under the framework established by gaap 
see the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements for more information on fair value measurements 

table of contents comparison of financial condition at december  and at december total assets 
total assets decreased by million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  the decrease in total assets resulted primarily from a million decrease in loans receivable  partially offset by increases in loans held for sale of million and real estate owned of million 
cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase in cash and cash equivalents reflects the company s decision to maintain higher levels of liquidity in the current weak economic and relatively low interest rate environment 
securities available for sale 
securities available for sale decreased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the decrease in the available for sale portfolio resulted from a million decrease in mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations plus a million decrease in municipal securities partially offset by a million increase in government agency securities 
mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations decreased by million to million at december  from million at december  the decrease in these securities was partially offset by a million increase in debt securities to million at december  from million as of december  the shift in the composition of the securities portfolio towards less volatile  shorter term debt securities reflects a decision to increase portfolio liquidity 
as of december   the company holds two available for sale securities with a total fair value of million and an amortized cost of that were determined to be other than temporarily impaired 
the  unrealized loss before taxes is included in other comprehensive income 
during the year ended december   million was identified as an other than temporary credit loss and was recognized as expense with respect to these two securities 
securities held to maturity 
securities held to maturity remained unchanged at million at both december  and as of december  and  the company held one security with an amortized cost of million that has been designated as held to maturity 
the estimated fair value of this security was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the final maturity of this security is  however  it is callable quarterly 
this higher yielding structured corporate note accrues interest based on the range of a constant maturity treasury yield spread and therefore has a higher potential for market value volatility 
as the company has the intent and ability to hold this security until it matures  it has been classified as held to maturity rather than as available for sale 
loans held for sale 
loans held for sale increased by million  or  to million at december   from million at december  during the current year  waterstone mortgage corporation entered into interim financing agreements with two external banks that provides for a total of million in lines of credit 
access to these lines of credit  along with additional internal financing allowed waterstone mortgage corporation to capitalize on the low interest environment and significantly increase its loan origination activity 
at december   substantially all loans held for sale are less than forty five days from origination and all loans held for sale are in process of being sold to third party investors 
loans receivable 
loans receivable held for investment decreased million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  the decrease in total loans receivable was primarily attributable to a million decrease in one to four family loans 
the decrease reflects a decline in loan demand for variable rate real estate mortgage loans as recent borrowers have preferred long term fixed rate products that the company does not generally retain in its portfolio 
decreases in loan balances in this and other categories also reflect an overall decrease in demand due to current economic conditions combined with the company s more stringent loan underwriting requirements 
as a result of the low rate environment with respect to long term fixed real estate mortgage products  the company has experienced a shift in the composition of our loan originations during the year ended december  from one to four family residential variable rate loans to residential real estate loans collateralized by over four family properties  as this category of borrower displayed relatively stable levels of demand for our existing products 
loans receivable were further decreased during the year ended december  by million in loans transferred to real estate owned 

table of contents allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses increased  or  to million at december  from million at december  the  increase in the allowance for loan losses during the year ended december  is attributable to a million increase in the general valuation allowance  partially offset by a million decrease in specific loan loss reserves related to impaired loans 
the increase in the general valuation allowance resulted from an increase in non performing loans and loans that  while still performing  have been identified as having higher risk characteristics 
the increase in the amount and number of loans identified as exhibiting elevated levels of risk with respect to loss outweighed the decline in overall delinquent loans 
loans with elevated risk profiles include loans internally classified as special mention and watch 
these loans resulted in a million increase to the general valuation allowance during the year 
this was partially offset by a million reduction to the general valuation allowance due primarily to a million decrease in the balance of loans outstanding 
the million decrease in specific loan loss reserves was primarily the result of a decrease in number and amount of impaired loans with significant collateral shortfalls 
as of december   the allowance for loan losses to total loans receivable was and was equal to of non performing loans  compared to and  respectively  at december  weakness in the residential real estate market has continued for the past three years and the risk of loss on loans secured by residential real estate remains at an elevated level 
that portion of the allowance for loan losses attributable to mortgage loans secured by one to four family residential real estate is substantially unchanged at of the total allowance for loan losses at december  compared to at december  cash surrender value of life insurance 
cash surrender value of life insurance increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to million in earnings credited 
real estate owned 
total real estate owned increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  during the year ended december   the company transferred to real estate owned from the loan portfolio 
during the same period the company sold approximately million of real estate owned 
the overall million increase in real estate owned was primarily due to a million increase in over four family properties 
deposits 
total deposits decreased million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  total time deposits decreased million  or  to million at december  from billion at december  time deposits originated through local retail outlets increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase in time deposits originated through our local markets was partially offset by a decrease in time deposits originated through the wholesale market 
time deposits originated through the wholesale market decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  because of the consent order issued by state and federal regulators effective december   the bank is prohibited from accepting or renewing brokered deposits and all other deposit rates are capped by the fdic 
total money market and savings deposits increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  total demand deposits increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  borrowings 
total borrowings decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  during the year ended december   five fhlbc advances totaling million with an average rate of matured 
the december  balance includes million outstanding on two bank lines of credit totaling million that were used to finance loans held for sale 
interest rates on the lines of credit are based on the note rate of the loans financed and equaled at december  there was no comparable balance at december  other liabilities 
other liabilities increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in outstanding checks related to amounts disbursed related to funds previously held in escrow for borrowers tax payments and amounts disbursed related to the company s normal operating expenses 
these amounts remain classified as other liabilities until settled 
shareholders equity 
shareholders equity increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase was primarily due to a million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss resulting from an increase in the fair value of available for sale securities 
other comprehensive income totaled million at december   compared to other comprehensive losses of million at december  in addition to the increase in accumulated other comprehensive income  shareholders equity was positively affected by a million increase in additional paid in capital related to stock compensation benefits and a  decrease in unearned esop shares 
the aforementioned increases in shareholders equity were partially offset by a million decrease in retained earnings reflecting the net loss for the year ended december

loan charge off activity and specific loan reserves are discussed in additional detail in the asset quality section 
the net interest margin for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  total interest income total interest income decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  interest income on loans decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the decrease in interest income was primarily due to a million  or  decrease in the average balance of loans outstanding to billion during the year ended december  from billion during the year ended december  the decrease in the average balance of loans reflect an overall decrease in demand due to current economic conditions combined with the company s more stringent loan underwriting requirements 
the decrease in interest income attributable to the decrease in average balance was compounded by a basis point decrease in the average yield on loans to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  interest income from mortgage related securities decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the decrease in interest income was primarily due to a million  or  decrease in the average balance of mortgage related securities to million for the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the decrease in interest income attributable to the decrease in average balance was compounded by a decrease in average yield 
the average yield on mortgage related securities decreased basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decline in the average balance of mortgage related securities during the year ended december  reflects management s decision to deemphasize investments in mortgage related securities and emphasize more liquid  less volatile  government agency securities 
finally  interest income from debt securities  federal funds sold and short term investments decreased  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  interest income decreased due to a basis point decline in the average yield on other earning assets to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decline in average yield provided by these assets reflects the lower overall interest rate environment as opposed to a shift in investment strategy and product mix 
the decrease in average rate was partially offset by an increase of million  or  in the average balance of other earning assets to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the increase in average balance reflects a strategic shift towards higher levels of liquidity 
the company intends to maintain higher than usual liquidity given the current economic environment and relatively low rates of return available on loans and mortgage related securities 
the average balance of debt securities  federal funds sold and short term investments includes fhlbc stock of million for each of the years ended december  and on october   the fhlbc entered into a consensual cease and desist order with its regulator  the federal housing finance board 
under the terms of the order  dividend declarations are subject to the prior written approval of the federal housing finance board 
on february   the fhlbc declared its first dividend since it entered into the cease and desist order 

table of contents total interest expense total interest expense decreased by million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease of basis points in the average cost of funds to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense resulted from a decrease in the average cost of funds as well as a decrease of million  or  in average interest bearing deposits and borrowings outstanding to billion for the year ended december  compared to an average balance of billion for the year ended december  interest expense on deposits decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  this was primarily due to a decrease in the average cost of deposits of basis points to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense attributable to the decrease in the cost of deposits was compounded by a decrease of million  or  in the average balance of interest bearing deposits to billion during the year ended december  from billion during the year ended december  the decrease in the cost of deposits reflects the federal reserve s historically low short term interest rate policy 
these rates are typically used by financial institutions in pricing deposit products 
the decrease in the average balance of interest bearing deposits was primarily due to a million decline in average non local or brokered deposits 
the average balance of brokered deposits totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense on borrowings decreased  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the decrease resulted from a million  or  decrease in average borrowings outstanding to million during the year ended december  from million during the comparable period in the decrease due to average balance was partially offset by a basis point increase in the average cost of borrowings to during the year ended december  from during the comparable period in the decreased use of borrowings as a source of funding during the year ended december  reflects our decision to utilize core deposits as our primary funding source 
net interest income net interest income increased by million or  to million during the year ended december  as compared to million during the year ended december  net interest income continues to be positively affected by lower short and medium term interest rates in  as compared to the increase in net interest income resulted primarily from a basis point increase in our interest rate spread to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the basis point increase in the interest rate spread resulted from a basis point decrease in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  which was partially offset by a basis point decrease in the average yield on interest earning assets 
the increase in net interest income resulting from an increase in our net interest rate spread was partially offset by a decrease in net interest income resulting from a change in the composition of interest earning assets 
while net interest earning assets increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million from the year ended december   the composition of interest earning assets shifted from loans to debt securities and short term investments  which yield a lower return 
the shift from loans towards debt securities and short term investments reflects an overall decrease in demand for loan products due to current economic conditions combined with the company s more stringent loan underwriting requirements 
the change in composition also reflects a strategic shift towards higher levels of liquidity 
provision for loan losses our provision for loan losses decreased  or  to million during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  while the provision for loan losses has decreased from the prior year  it remained at historically high levels 
these levels remain high due to continued general economic stress resulting in reduced levels of income earned by many of our borrowers combined with loan collateral values  primarily real estate  that remain at levels below those estimated at the time the loans were originally made 
these factors result in higher levels of actual loss experience which when applied to the portfolio in general require higher loan loss provisions 
they also result in more loans exhibiting risk characteristics that require estimated loan loss provisions in excess of our historical average experience rates 
these risk characteristics include reduced borrower global cash flow  reduced borrower fico scores and known declines in collateral value even though the loan may still be performing 
the provision for the year ended december  was the result of million of net loan charge offs combined with continued weakness in local real estate markets which required an overall increase to the allowance for loan losses 
see the asset quality section for an analysis of charge offs  nonperforming assets  specific reserves and additional provisions 

table of contents noninterest income total noninterest income increased million to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the increase primarily resulted from an increase in mortgage banking income 
mortgage banking income increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million during the comparable period in in addition to the increase in mortgage banking activity  the increase in noninterest income compared to the prior period resulted from an million decrease in impairment charge on securities considered to be other than temporarily impaired 
mortgage banking income mortgage banking income increased million to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the increase was the combined result of increased volume  increased sales margins  expansion of the branch network and the addition of mandatory loan delivery terms 
during the year ended december   mortgage banking expanded from to branch locations outside of the bank branch network 
new branches were added in illinois  maryland  north carolina  colorado  florida and minnesota 
volume and margin changes account for million  or  of the million increase in mortgage banking income year over year 
the volume of loans sold during increased by million  or  to billion in from million in in addition  the average sales margin increased by basis points to in from in this combination accounted for million  or  of the total volume and margin change in mortgage banking income 
the remaining million increase in mortgage banking income due to volume and margin changes relates directly to the increase in processing income 
the branch expansion noted above was the primary driver in the volume increase over the prior year 
volume at the new branches added during the year ended december  totaled million  which represented of the total increase in volume for the year 
improvement in sales margins were attributable to an increase in higher margin government guaranteed loans  an increase in loans for the purchase of residential real estate and an increase in volume in higher margin markets around the country 
in  government guaranteed loans accounted for of total mortgage banking volume  up from in the average sales margin on government guaranteed loans was basis points higher than that on conventional mortgage loans 
also in  loans for the purchase of residential real estate accounted for of total mortgage banking volume  up from in the average sales margin on loans for the purchase of real estate was basis points higher than that on loan refinances 
sales margins vary from market to market around the country 
there was a basis point spread between the company s highest margin branch and its lowest margin branch during the year ended december  during sales volumes increased at high margin branches in minnesota  arizona and maryland 
branches in these three states produced of the million increase in volume for as compared to the minnesota branches accounted for million in increased volume during with a sales margin that was basis points higher the company s weighted average sales margin 
the arizona branch accounted for million in increased volume during with a sales margin that was basis points higher than the company s weighted average sales margin 
the maryland branch accounted for million in increased volume during with a sales margin that was basis points higher than the company s weighted average sales margin 
branches are operated on a net branch basis whereby predetermined margins and direct expenses are paid by the branch office to the corporate office and remaining net income accrues to the branch manager 
successful branches generate higher levels of revenue and expense with an eye toward increasing branch manager net income 
branch income accounts for million  or  of the increase in mortgage banking income for over the prior year 
this increase in mortgage banking income is offset by increases in mortgage banking expenses distributed among the noninterest expense categories of the income statement 
a full of this increase  or million  is offset by branch manager payroll which increased to million in from million in and is included in compensation  payroll taxes  and other employee benefits expense on the consolidated statements of operations 
prior to  the company originated loans held for sale on a best efforts delivery basis 
under the best efforts delivery method  the buyer of the loan  or investor  assumed all interest rate risk 
just prior to the end of  the company began to originate loans for sale on a mandatory delivery basis 
under the mandatory delivery method  the investor committed to buy only those loans that were originated within a specified yield to the buyer 
higher fees are paid by the investor to the originator for mandatory delivery as compared to best efforts delivery in exchange for the assumption of interest rate risk 
mortgage banking income increased by million in over as a result of loans sold on a mandatory delivery method net of hedging gains and losses 

table of contents noninterest expense total noninterest expense increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year december  the increase was primarily attributable to increased compensation and other operating expenses

other noninterest expense increased million or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the increase in other noninterest expense is a direct result of the increase in operational costs related to the expansion of our mortgage banking operations 
income taxes despite a pre tax loss  we recorded income tax expense of  for the year ended december  primarily due to differences between prior year estimates and actual tax returns filed plus state income tax due to taxable income generated by the mortgage banking subsidiary 
due to the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  we were not able to record an income tax benefit related to the pre tax loss incurred 
a current income tax benefit that would normally result from a pre tax loss was offset by additional deferred tax expense due to an increase in the required valuation allowance 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of federal and wisconsin tax law changes enacted during in the first quarter a wisconsin state tax law change was enacted with retroactive effect to january  requiring combined filing in wisconsin 
we recognized a state benefit in connection with the establishment of a wisconsin deferred tax asset which does not require a valuation allowance related to the unrealized loss on securities available for sale owned by the company s nevada subsidiary 
in addition  we recognized a federal tax benefit as a result of legislation passed in the fourth quarter of allowing for a one time carry back of tax losses for up to five years

the loan was originated to facilitate the sale of company owned real estate during and the million represented interest income that was collected but not recognized during the facilitation period 
the loan was paid in full during the third quarter of  which resulted in full recognition of interest collected in prior periods 
this transaction had the effect of increasing the average yield on interest earning assets by basis points for the year ended december  interest income on mortgage related securities decreased  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the decrease in interest income was primarily due to a million  or  decrease in the average balance of mortgage related securities to million for the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the average yield on mortgage related securities remained unchanged at for the years ended december  and the decline in the average balance of mortgage related securities during the year ended december  reflects management s decision to reinvest security portfolio cash flows in the more liquid government agency and higher yielding municipal debt securities 
interest income on other earnings assets  consisting of debt securities  federal funds sold and short term investments remained stable at million for both the year ended december  and  notwithstanding a basis point decline in the average yield on other earning assets to for the year ended december  from for the comparable period in the decrease in average yield on these investments reflected the decline in market interest rates as opposed to a shift in investment strategy or product mix 
the decrease in average yield was offset by a million  or  increase in the average balance of other earning assets to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in average balance reflected a strategic shift towards higher levels of liquidity 
the company intends to maintain higher than usual liquidity given the current economic environment and relatively low rates of return available on loans and mortgage related securities 
the average balance of debt securities  federal funds sold and short term investments includes fhlbc stock of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on october   the fhlbc entered into a consensual cease and desist order with its regulator  the federal housing finance board 
under the terms of the order  dividend declarations are subject to the prior written approval of the federal housing finance board 
the fhlbc has not declared a dividend since it entered into the cease and desist order 
at the request of the fhlbc  on july   the finance board amended the cease and desist order to allow the fhlbc to redeem incremental purchases of capital stock tied to increased levels of borrowing through advances after repayment of those new advances 

table of contents total interest expense total interest expense decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was the result of a decrease of basis point decrease in our cost of funds to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   which was partially offset by a million  or  increase in average interest bearing deposits and borrowings outstanding to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the year ended december  interest expense on deposits decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the comparable period in this was due to a decrease in the average cost of deposits of basis points to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense attributable to the decrease in the cost of deposits was partially offset by an increase of million  or  in the average balance of interest bearing deposits to billion for the year ended december  from billion during the year ended december  the decrease in the average cost of deposits reflects the federal reserve s reduction of short term interest rates which are typically used by financial institutions in pricing deposit products 
interest expense on borrowings decreased  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the decrease resulted primarily from a basis point decrease in the average cost of borrowings to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   which was partially offset by a million  or  increase in average borrowings outstanding to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increased use of borrowings as a source of funding for the year ended december  reflected our assessment that such sources of funds provided favorable rates and terms compared to retail funding sources 
the reduction in short term interest rates by the federal reserve allowed banks such as waterstone bank to borrow funds at lower rates  helping to reduce our cost of funds 
net interest income net interest income increased by million or  to million during the year ended december  as compared to million during the year ended december  net interest income continues to be positively affected by lower short and medium term interest rates in  as compared to and by our interest bearing liabilities repricing at a faster rate than our interest earning assets 
the increase in net interest income resulted primarily from a basis point increase in our interest rate spread to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the basis point increase in the interest rate spread resulted from a basis point decrease in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  which was only partially offset by a basis point decrease in the average yield on interest earning assets 
the increase in net interest income resulting from an increase in our net interest rate spread was partially offset by a decrease in average net earning assets of million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million from the year ended december  the decrease in average net earning assets was primarily attributable to an increase in loans transferred to real estate owned 
the average balance of real estate owned totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  provision for loan losses our provision for loan losses decreased million  to million during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  while the provision for loan losses has decreased from the prior year  it remained at historically high levels 
these levels remain high due to continued general economic stress resulting in reduced levels of income earned by many of our borrowers combined with loan collateral values  primarily real estate  that remain at levels below those estimated at the time the loans were originally made 
these factors result in higher levels of actual loss experience which when applied to the portfolio in general require higher loan loss provisions 
they also result in more loans exhibiting risk characteristics that require estimated loan loss provisions in excess of our historical average experience rates 
these risk characteristics include reduced borrower global cash flow  reduced borrower fico scores and known declines in collateral value even though the loan may still be performing 
the provision for the year ended december  was the result of million of net loan charge offs combined with continued weakness in local real estate markets which required an overall increase to the allowance for loan losses 
see the asset quality section for an analysis of charge offs  nonperforming assets  specific reserves and additional provisions 
noninterest income total noninterest income increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the increase primarily resulted from an increase in mortgage banking income 
mortgage banking income increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million during the comparable period in the increase was the result of an expansion of the branch network of our mortgage banking subsidiary and increased mortgage loan refinancing triggered by declines in mortgage interest rates during the period 
during the year ended december   the company sold million of mortgage loans into the secondary market  as compared to million during the comparable period in 
table of contents noninterest expense total noninterest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to higher fdic insurance premiums  including a special assessment charged to income during the second quarter of  and real estate owned expense 
compensation  payroll taxes and other employee benefits expense increased  or  to million during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  due primarily to an expansion of our mortgage banking operations  total compensation  and payroll taxes increased  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  company paid health insurance expense increased  to million during the year ended december  compared to  during the year ended december  partially offsetting the increase in compensation and health insurance expense  esop expense decreased  to  for the year ended december  compared to  during the year ended december  this decrease reflects the decrease in the company s average share price for the year ended december  compared to real estate owned expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  real estate owned expense includes the net gain or loss recognized upon the sale of a foreclosed property  as well as the net operating and carrying costs related to the properties 
for the year ended december   net operational expenses increased  to million from million during the year ended december  for the year ended december   the company allocated additional resources to increasing occupancy rates and controlling costs at its income producing properties 
as a result  net operational expenses were relatively stable given the increase in properties under management 
the average balance of real estate owned totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  net losses recognized on the write down or sale of real estate owned totaled million during the year ended december   compared to a net losses of million during the year ended december  other noninterest expense increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from a million increase in fdic deposit insurance premiums to million for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase resulted from both an increase in the premium rate as well as a special assessment totaling  that was paid on september  income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of federal and wisconsin tax law changes enacted during in the first quarter a wisconsin state tax law change was enacted with retroactive effect to january  requiring combined filing in wisconsin 
we recognized a state benefit in connection with the establishment of a wisconsin deferred tax asset which does not require a valuation allowance related to the unrealized loss on securities available for sale owned by the company s nevada subsidiary 
in addition  we recognized a federal tax benefit as a result of legislation passed in the fourth quarter of allowing for a one time carry back of tax losses for up to five years 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december   was 
income tax expense of million for the year ended december  is comprised of million in deferred tax expense partially offset by current tax benefit of million 
the deferred tax expense is the result of valuation allowances established in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december   was 
net loss as a result of the foregoing factors  net loss for the year ended december  was million as compared to a net loss of million during the year ended december  
table of contents liquidity and capital resources we maintain liquid assets at levels we consider adequate to meet our liquidity needs 
our liquidity ratio averaged and for the years ended december  and the liquidity ratio is equal to average daily cash and cash equivalents for the period divided by average total assets 
we adjust our liquidity levels to fund loan commitments  repay our borrowings  fund deposit outflows and pay real estate taxes on mortgage loans 
we also adjust liquidity as appropriate to meet asset and liability management objectives 
the operational adequacy of our liquidity position at any point in time is dependent upon the judgment of the chief financial officer as supported by the full asset liability committee 
liquidity is monitored on a daily  weekly and monthly basis using a variety of measurement tools and indicators 
regulatory liquidity  as required by the wisconsin department of financial institutions  is based on current liquid assets as a percentage of the prior month s average deposits and short term borrowings 
minimum primary liquidity is equal to of deposits and short term borrowings and minimum total regulatory liquidity is equal to of deposits and short term borrowings 
the bank s primary and total regulatory liquidity at december  were and  respectively 
our primary sources of liquidity are deposits  repayment of loans  sales of loans held for sale  maturities of investment securities and other short term investments  and earnings and funds provided from operations 
while scheduled principal repayments on loans are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flows  loan prepayments and the origination and sale of loans held for sale are greatly influenced by market interest rates  economic conditions  and rates offered by our competitors 
however  effective march   our deposit rates are capped by the fdic as a result of the consent order issued by federal and state regulators 
we set the interest rates on our deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits 
in addition  we invest excess funds in short term interest earning assets  which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements 
additional sources of liquidity for the purpose of managing long and short term cash flows include advances from the fhlbc 
a portion of our liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents  which are a product of our operating  investing and financing activities 
at december  and  respectively  million and million of our assets were invested in cash and cash equivalents 
our primary sources of cash are principal repayments on loans  proceeds from the calls and maturities of debt and mortgage related securities  increases in deposit accounts  federal funds purchased and advances from the fhlbc 
on october   the fhlbc entered into a consensual cease and desist order with its regulator  the federal housing finance board 
under the terms of the order  capital stock repurchases and redemptions  including redemptions upon membership withdrawal or other termination  are prohibited unless the fhlbc has received approval of the director of the office of supervision of the federal housing finance board os director 
the order also provides that dividend declarations are subject to the prior written approval of the os director 
we currently hold  at cost  million of fhlbc stock  all of which we believe we will ultimately be able to recover 
based upon correspondence we received from the fhlbc  also incorporated into fhlbc s k  there is currently no expectation that this cease and desist order will impact the short and long term funding options provided by the fhlbc 
our cash flows are derived from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows included in our consolidated financial statements 
during the years ended december  and  loan repayments net of loan originations generated positive cash flows of million and million  respectively 
the decrease in loans receivable is reflective of the general decline in loan demand for variable rate residential real estate mortgage loans combined with the company s tightened underwriting standards given the current economic conditions 
during the year ended december  our loan originations  net of collected principal  totaled million 
cash received from the calls  maturities and principal repayments of debt and mortgage related securities totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we purchased million  million and million in debt and mortgage related securities classified as available for sale during the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  we purchased million in securities classified as held to maturity during the year ended december  we sold million and  in available for sale debt and mortgage related securities during the years ended december  and there were no securities sold during the year ended december  
table of contents deposit flows are generally affected by the level of interest rates  market conditions and products offered by local competitors and other factors 
the net decrease in deposits was million during the year ended december  this compares to a net decrease in deposits of million for the year ended december  and an increase of million for the year ended december  as a result of the consent order issued by state and federal regulators effective december   the bank is prohibited from accepting or renewing brokered deposits and all other deposit rates are capped by the fdic 
liquidity management is both a daily and longer term function of business management 
if we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  borrowing agreements exist with the fhlbc  which provide an additional source of funds 
at december   we had million in fixed rate advances from the fhlbc  of which none were due within months  but all of which are putable at the option of the fhlbc 
the weighted average rate on these advances was as of december  at december   we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of million and unfunded commitments under construction loans  lines of credit and standby letters of credit of million 
at december   certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in less than one year totaled million 
based on prior experience  management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
in the event a significant portion of our deposits are not retained by us  we will have to utilize other funding sources  such as fhlbc advances to maintain our level of assets 
however  such borrowings may not be available on attractive terms  or at all  if and when needed 
alternatively  we would reduce our level of liquid assets  such as our cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale in order to meet funding needs 
in addition  the cost of such deposits may be significantly higher if market interest rates are higher or there is an increased amount of competition for deposits in our market area at the time of renewal

impact of recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued asc topic  accounting for transfers of financial assets 
the standard removes the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity from asc topic  transfers and servicing  and eliminates the exception for qualifying special purpose entities from consolidation guidance 
in addition  the standard establishes specific conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale 
if the transfer does not meet established sale conditions  the transferor and transferee must account for the transfer as a secured borrowing 
an enterprise that continues to transfer portions of a financial asset that do not meet the established sale conditions would be eligible to record a sale only after it has transferred all of its interest in that asset

 consolidations topic improvements to financial reporting for enterprises involved with variable interest entities 
the standard replaces the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise  if any  is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the variable interest entity with a qualitative approach focused on identifying which enterprise has both the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the entity 
in addition  the standard requires reconsideration of whether an entity is a variable interest entity when any changes in facts and circumstances occur such that the holders of the equity investment at risk  as a group  lose the power from voting rights or similar rights of those investments to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
it also requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and additional disclosures about an enterprise s involvement in variable interest entities

impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and accompanying notes of waterstone bank have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
gaap generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of inflation

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of market risk general 
the majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
consequently  our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
our assets  consisting primarily of mortgage loans  have longer maturities than our liabilities  consisting primarily of deposits 
as a result  a principal part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and reduce the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  waterstone bank s board of directors has established an asset liability committee which is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities  for determining the level of risk that is appropriate given our business strategy  operating environment  capital  liquidity and performance objectives  and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors 
management monitors the level of interest rate risk on a regular basis and the asset liability committee meets at least weekly to review our asset liability policies and interest rate risk position  which are evaluated quarterly 
we have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
we have implemented the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk i emphasizing variable rate loans including variable rate one to four family  and commercial real estate loans as well as three to five year commercial real estate balloon loans  ii reducing and shortening the expected average life of the investment portfolio  and iii whenever possible  lengthening the term structure of our deposit base and our borrowings from the fhlbc 
these measures should reduce the volatility of our net interest income in different interest rate environments 
income simulation 
simulation analysis is an estimate of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time 
at least quarterly we review the potential effect changes in interest rates may have on the repayment or repricing of rate sensitive assets and funding requirements of rate sensitive liabilities 
our most recent simulation uses projected repricing of assets and liabilities at december  on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated repayments and scheduled rate adjustments 
prepayment rate assumptions may have a significant impact on interest income simulation results 
because of the large percentage of loans and mortgage backed securities we hold  rising or falling interest rates may have a significant impact on the actual prepayment speeds of our mortgage related assets that may in turn affect our interest rate sensitivity position 
when interest rates rise  prepayment speeds slow and the average expected lives of our assets would tend to lengthen more than the expected average lives of our liabilities and therefore would most likely have a negative impact on net interest income and earnings 

table of contents percentage increase decrease in estimated net annual interest income over months basis point gradual rise in rates basis point gradual rise in rates basis point gradual rise in rates basis point gradual decline in rates basis point gradual decline in rates basis point gradual decline in rates waterstone bank s asset liability policy limits projected changes in net average annual interest income to a maximum decline of for various levels of interest rate changes measured over a month period when compared to the flat rate scenario 
in addition  projected changes in the economic value of equity are limited to a maximum decline of to for interest rate movements of to basis points when compared to the flat rate scenario 
these limits are re evaluated on a periodic basis and may be modified  as appropriate 
because our balance sheet is asset sensitive  net interest income is projected to decline as interest rates fall 
at december   a basis point gradual increase in interest rates had the effect of decreasing forecast net interest income by while a basis point decrease in rates had the effect of decreasing net interest income by 
at december   a basis point gradual increase in interest rates had the effect of decreasing the economic value of equity by while a basis point decrease in rates had the effect of decreasing the economic value of equity by 
while we believe the assumptions used are reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates will approximate actual future mortgage backed security and loan repayment activity
