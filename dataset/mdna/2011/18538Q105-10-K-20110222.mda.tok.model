overview we are a leading provider of g wireless broadband services 
we build and operate next generation mobile broadband networks that provide high speed mobile internet and residential access services  as well as residential voice services  in communities throughout the country 
our g mobile broadband network provide a connection anywhere within our coverage area 
during  we focused on building out and augmenting our networks  increasing our retail and wholesale subscriber bases  expanding our wholesale partnerships  and obtaining additional capital 
we increased the number of people covered by our networks by over million in  and increased our total subscriber base by almost million subscribers 
additionally  we added new wholesale partners such as best buy and cbeyond during the year 
as of december   our networks covered an estimated million people in the united states and europe 
we offered our services in markets in the united states covering an estimated million people  including an estimated million people covered by our g mobile broadband network in markets 
we ended the year with approximately million retail and million wholesale subscribers 
approximately of our wholesale subscribers were users of multi mode g g devices residing in areas where we have not yet launched g service  but from whom we currently receive nominal revenue 
by the end of  our g mobile broadband markets in the united states included major metropolitan areas such as atlanta  baltimore  boston  chicago  cincinnati  cleveland  columbus  dallas  honolulu  houston  kansas city  las vegas  los angeles  miami  new york  philadelphia  pittsburg  orlando  salt lake city  san antonio  san francisco  seattle  st 
louis and washington dc as of december   the remaining markets in the united states continue to operate with a legacy network technology 
internationally  as of december   our networks covered an estimated million people 
we offer g mobile broadband services in seville and malaga  spain 
in  we raised approximately billion in additional funding 
in the fourth quarter of  we distributed subscription rights at a price of per share that were exercisable for up to  shares of our class a common stock  which we refer to as the rights offering 
the rights offering expired on june  and 
rights to purchase million shares of class a common stock were exercised for an aggregate purchase price of million 
during the fourth quarter of  clearwire communications completed offerings of billion senior secured notes due  which we refer to as the senior secured notes 
during december  we issued an additional million 
table of contents clearwire corporation and subsidiaries continued of senior secured notes  completed an offering of million second priority secured notes  and completed offerings of aggregate million exchangeable notes  which we refer to as the exchangeable notes 
the proceeds from these notes issuances and various vendor financing initiatives will allow us to focus on improving the operating performance of our business while seeking to raise additional capital 
in  we plan to focus on improving the operating performance of our business and we do not expect to materially expand the coverage of our g mobile broadband network absent additional funding 
we currently believe that the actions we are taking will cause our current business to generate positive cash flows over the next few years without the need for additional capital 
we expect to do this by increasing the operating efficiencies related to our retail subscribers and continuing to grow our wholesale subscriber base 
the success of our current plans will depend to a large extent on whether we succeed in growing our wholesale subscriber base and generating the revenue levels we currently expect for that portion of our business 
however  our current plans are based on a number of assumptions about our future performance  which may prove to be inaccurate 
these assumptions include  among other things  a favorable resolution of the current wholesale pricing disputes with sprint  continued increases in sales of our services by sprint and our other initial wholesale partners  our ability to cause the services we offer over our g mobile broadband network to remain competitive with service offerings from our competitors  and our ability to reduce our operating expenses and capital expenditures 
if any of the assumptions underlying our plans prove to be incorrect and  as a result  our business fails to perform as we expect  we may require substantial additional capital in the near and long term to be able to continue to operate 
for the year ended december   substantially all of our wholesale subscribers and revenues came from sprint with whom we are currently engaged in arbitration proceedings and related negotiations to resolve issues related to wholesale pricing under our commercial agreements with them 
see legal proceedings 
although we currently anticipate that we and sprint will resolve the pricing disputes in the near term  if we are unable to reach a satisfactory resolution of our current negotiations with them  or if sprint fails to resell our services in the manner and amounts we expect  it could adversely affect our business prospects and results and we could be required to revise our current business plans 
see risk factors we are currently involved in pricing disputes with sprint relating to g usage by sprint under our commercial agreements  and if the disputes are not resolved favorably to us  it could materially and adversely affect our business prospects  and results of operations and financial condition  and or require us to revise our current business plans 
to execute our current plans  we must also successfully reduce our expenses by implementing various cost savings initiatives 
our actions have already included workforce reductions in  which are expected to reduce labor and other costs by approximately million annually 
furthermore  we intend to materially decrease our retail subscriber acquisition costs by focusing our sales efforts on lower cost channels such as indirect dealers and online sales  to reduce the amount we spend on marketing our retail services  to delay the launch of new devices  including smartphones and to outsource our customer care operations 
we believe these initiatives will likely result in slower growth in our retail subscriber base in compared to prior periods as we pace our retail growth in an effort to maximize our financial resources 
we are also actively pursuing a number of alternatives for raising additional capital 
any additional capital may be used to cover any cash needs that may arise if the assumptions underlying our current plans prove to be inaccurate and to continue the development of our g mobile broadband network 
any additional capital available for network development will likely be used  among other things  to augment our network coverage and capacity in our existing markets  to expand the coverage of our g mobile broadband network to new markets  and to introduce new products or services into our retail business 
additionally  we may use a portion of any additional capital we raise to deploy alternative technologies to mobile wimax  such as lte  on our networks either together with  or in place of  mobile wimax if we determine it is necessary to cause the g mobile broadband services we offer to remain competitive or to expand the number and types of devices that may be used to access our services 
business segments operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker  which we refer to as the codm  in 
table of contents clearwire corporation and subsidiaries continued deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
operating segments can be aggregated for segment reporting purposes so long as certain aggregation criteria are met 
we define the codm as our chief executive officer 
as our business continues to mature  we assess how we view and operate our business 
based on the nature of our operations  we market a service that is basically the same service across our united states and international markets 
our codm assesses and reviews our performance and makes resource allocation decisions at the domestic and international levels 
for the years ended december   and  we have identified two reportable segments the united states and the international business 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates used  including those related to long lived assets and intangible assets  including spectrum  derivatives and deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
our accounting policies require management to make complex and subjective judgments 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our subscribers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
additionally  changes in accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
these factors could have a material impact on our financial statements  the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
we have identified the following accounting policies and estimates that involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity and that we believe are key to an understanding of our financial statements spectrum licenses we have three types of arrangements for spectrum licenses owned spectrum licenses with indefinite lives  owned spectrum licenses with definite lives and spectrum leases 
while owned spectrum licenses in the united states are issued for a fixed time  renewals of these licenses have occurred routinely and at nominal cost 
moreover  management has determined that there are currently no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic or other factors that limit the useful lives of our owned spectrum licenses and therefore  the licenses are accounted for as intangible assets with indefinite lives 
as discussed in risk factors if we do not obtain and maintain rights to use licensed spectrum in one or more markets  we may be unable to operate in these markets  which could adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategy  most of our spectrum licenses in the united states are subject to substantial service requirements imposed by the fcc by may  we are in the process of implementing a plan to comply with the substantial service requirements by the deadline and we will likely seek waivers or extensions of the deadline from the fcc in some circumstances 
changes in these factors or our ability to meet the substantial service requirements may have a significant effect on our assessment of the useful lives of our owned spectrum licenses and failure to meet the substantial service requirements may result in a write off of the carrying value of the associated spectrum licenses 
we assess the impairment of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  consisting of spectrum licenses  at least annually  or whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of such asset or group of assets may be impaired 
our annual impairment testing is performed as of each october st and we perform a review of the existence of events or changes in circumstances related to the impairment of our intangible assets with indefinite useful lives on a quarterly basis 
factors we consider important  any of which could trigger an impairment review  include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in our use of the assets or the strategy for our overall business  and 
table of contents clearwire corporation and subsidiaries continued significant negative industry or economic trends 
the impairment test for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount 
we calculate the fair value of spectrum using a discounted cash flow model the greenfield approach  which approximates value by assuming a company is started owning only the spectrum licenses  and then makes investments required to build an operation comparable to the one in which the licenses are presently utilized 
we utilized a year discrete period to isolate cash flows attributable to the licenses including modeling the hypothetical build out of a nationwide network 
assumptions key in estimating fair value under this method include  but are not limited to  revenue and subscriber growth rates  operating expenditures  capital expenditures and timing of build out  market share achieved  terminal value growth rate  tax rates and discount rate 
the assumptions which underlie the development of the network  subscriber base and other critical inputs of the discounted cash flow model were based on a combination of average marketplace participant data and our historical results and business plans 
the discount rate used in the model represents a weighted average cost of capital taking into account the cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and equity in a target capital structure and the perceived risk associated with an intangible asset such as our spectrum licenses 
the terminal value growth rate represents our estimate of the marketplace s long term growth rate 
we validate the fair value obtained from the greenfield approach against market data  when available 
we had no impairment of our indefinite lived intangible assets in the united states in any of the periods presented 
if the projected buildout to the target population coverage was delayed by one year and the buildout rate of preceding periods were to decline by  the fair values of the licenses  while less than currently projected  would still be higher than their book values 
however  if there is a substantial adverse decline in the operating profitability of the wireless service industry  we could have material impairment charges in future years which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
impairments of long lived assets we review our long lived assets to be held and used  including property  plant and equipment  which we refer to as pp e  and intangible assets with definite useful lives  which consists primarily of spectrum licenses with definite lives and subscriber relationships  for recoverability whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of such long lived asset or group of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
such circumstances include  but are not limited to the following a significant decrease in the market price of the asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which the asset is being used  a significant change in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset  a current period loss combined with projections of continuing losses associated with use of the asset  a significant change in our business or technology strategy  a significant change in our management s views of growth rates for our business  and a significant change in the anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions and expected technological availability 
we evaluate quarterly  or as needed  whether such events and circumstances have occurred 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining the occurrence of an indicator of impairment that requires an evaluation of the recoverability of our long lived assets 
when such events or circumstances exist  we determine the recoverability of the asset s carrying value by estimating the undiscounted future net cash flows cash inflows less associated cash outflows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use of the asset 
recoverability analyses  when performed  are based on probability weighted forecasted cash flows that consider our business and technology strategy  management s views of growth rates for the business  anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions and expected technological availability 
if the total of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment  if any  is recognized for the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value 

table of contents clearwire corporation and subsidiaries continued our long lived assets  consisting of pp e and definite lived intangible assets such as subscriber relationships and our spectrum licenses in the united states  are combined into a single asset group for purposes of testing impairment because management believes that utilizing these assets as a group represents the highest and best use of the assets and is consistent with the management s strategy of utilizing our spectrum licenses on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide network 
internationally  our long lived assets  consisting of pp e  definite lived intangible assets such as subscriber relationships  and our spectrum assets are primarily combined into a single asset group for each country in which we operate for purposes of testing impairment 
in the third quarter of  due to our continued losses and significant uncertainties surrounding our ability to obtain required liquidity to fund our operating and capital needs  management concluded that an adverse change in circumstances existed requiring us to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets 
based on this assessment  we determined that the carrying value of our long lived assets in the united states was recoverable  primarily supported by the fair value of our spectrum licenses 
management has determined that a similar assessment was not necessary in the fourth quarter 
property  plant equipment a significant portion of our total assets is pp e 
pp e represented billion of our billion in total assets as of december  we generally calculate depreciation on these assets using the straight line method based on estimated economic useful lives 
the estimated useful life of equipment is determined based on historical usage of identical or similar equipment  with consideration given to technological changes and industry trends that could impact the network architecture and asset utilization 
since changes in technology or in our intended use of these assets  as well as changes in broad economic or industry factors  may cause the estimated period of use of these assets to change  we periodically review these factors to assess the remaining life of our asset base 
when these factors indicate that an asset s useful life is different from the previous assessment  we depreciate the remaining book values prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life 
we capitalize certain direct costs  including certain salary and benefit costs and overhead costs  incurred to prepare the asset for its intended use 
we also capitalize interest associated with certain acquisition or construction costs of network related assets 
capitalized interest and direct costs are reported as part of the cost of the network related assets and as a reduction in the related expense in the statement of operations 
we periodically assess certain assets that have not yet been deployed in our networks  including network equipment and cell site development costs 
this assessment includes the write off of network equipment for estimated shrinkage experienced during the deployment process and the write down of network equipment and cell site development costs whenever events or changes in circumstances cause us to conclude that such assets are no longer needed to meet our strategic network plans and will not be deployed 
with the substantial completion of our prior build plans and due to the uncertainty of the extent and timing of future expansion of our networks  we reviewed all network projects in process 
any network projects in process that no longer fit within management s strategic network plans were abandoned and the related costs written down 
as we continue to revise our build plans in response to changes in our strategy  funding availability  technology and industry trends  additional projects could be identified for abandonment  for which the associated write downs could be material 
derivative valuation derivative financial instruments are recorded as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at their fair value on the date of issuance and are remeasured to fair value on each subsequent balance sheet date until such instruments are exercised or expire  with any changes in the fair value between reporting periods recorded as other income or expense 
at december   derivative financial instruments requiring revaluation are composed primarily of the exchange options  which we refer to as exchange options  embedded in our exchangeable notes issued in december that were required to be accounted for separately from the debt host contract 

table of contents clearwire corporation and subsidiaries continued valuation of the exchange options requires assumptions involving judgment as they are embedded derivatives within host contracts and consequently are not traded on an exchange 
we estimate the fair value using a trinomial option pricing model based on the individual characteristics of the exchange feature  observable market based inputs for stock price and risk free interest rate  and an assumption for volatility 
estimated volatility is a measure of risk or variability of our stock price over the life of the option 
the estimated volatility is based on our historical stock price volatility giving consideration to our estimates of market participant adjustments for the general conditions of the market as well as company specific factors such as our market trading volume and the expected future performance of the company 
our stock s volatility is an input assumption requiring significant judgment 
holding all other pricing assumptions constant  an increase or decrease of in our estimated stock volatility could result in a loss of million  or a gain of million  respectively 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit  or that future deductibility is uncertain 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
deferred tax asset valuations require significant management judgment in making such determination 
in doing so  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our limited operating history  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income loss  tax planning strategies and recent financial performance 
we believe that our estimates are reasonable  however  actual results could differ from these estimates

wholesale revenue in is based upon minimal wholesale rate and usage assumptions due to unresolved issues around wholesale pricing for wholesale transactions with sprint 
revenues in the united states represented and international represented of total revenues for the year ended december   compared to for the united states and for international for the year ended december  the increase in revenues for compared to is primarily due to twelve months of revenues received from our operation of markets in  compared to one month for following the closing on november   when we acquired all of the old clearwire markets and subscribers 
we also launched new g markets in  primarily in the latter half of the year  and began offering our services through wholesale partners in all of our g markets

cost of goods and services also includes the cost of cpe sold to subscribers 
network costs primarily consist of network repair and maintenance costs  rent for pop facilities and costs to transport data traffic between pop sites 
year ended percentage percentage december  change change in thousands  except percentages versus versus cost of goods and services and network costs for the year ended december   we incurred approximately million in tower costs and million in network costs  compared to approximately million in tower costs and million in 
table of contents network costs in the prior year 
these increases are primarily due to an increase in the number of tower leases and an increase in related backhaul and network expenses resulting from our network expansion activities and the launch of new g markets during during the year ended december   we incurred approximately million in charges related to obsolete cpe  write offs of identified differences between recorded amounts and the results of physical counts of network base station equipment and an increase in our reserve for excess and obsolete equipment 
shrinkage of network base station equipment primarily represents losses experienced during the deployment process  while the reserves for excess and obsolete equipment represents the costs of equipment that exceeds our current needs  or is no longer being deployed in the networks due to obsolescence 
write offs of cpe primarily represent leased modems not expected to be recovered from former subscribers 
during  we incurred approximately million due to write offs of cpe  identified differences between recorded amounts and the results of physical counts of network base station equipment and an increase in reserves for excess and obsolete equipment 
for the year ended december   we incurred approximately million in tower costs and million in network costs  compared to approximately million in tower costs and million in network costs in these increases are primarily due to an increase in the number of tower leases and an increase in related backhaul and network expenses resulting from the launch of new g markets during we incurred twelve months of tower costs and related backhaul and network expenses during  compared to one month for following the closing on november   when we acquired all of the old clearwire tower leases and backhaul agreements 
we expect costs of goods and services and network costs  excluding the impact of write offs and obsolescence allowance described above  to continue to increase in future periods as we operate our networks in our launched markets for a full year 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative  which we refer to as sg a  expenses include all of the following costs associated with salaries and benefits  advertising  trade shows  public relations  promotions and other market development programs  facilities costs  third party professional service fees  customer care  sales commissions  bad debt expense  and administrative support activities  including executive  finance and accounting  it  legal  human resources  treasury and other shared services 
year ended percentage percentage december  change change in thousands  except percentages versus versus selling  general and administrative expense the increase in sg a expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in is primarily due to the higher sales and marketing and customer care expenses as well as additional resources  headcount and shared services that we utilized as we launched our g mobile broadband services in additional markets in marketing and advertising costs increased million  or  in from due to the increase in gross subscriber additions and costs incurred in support of the launch of new g markets during employee related costs increased million  or  in compared to primarily due to an increase in headcount during the year

our average employee headcount increased approximately for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  the increase in sg a expenses in compared to is consistent with the additional resources  headcount and shared services that we utilized as we continued to build and launch our g mobile broadband services in additional markets  especially the higher sales and marketing and customer care expenses in support of the launch of new markets 
employee headcount increased at december  to approximately  employees compared to approximately  employees at december  
table of contents we expect sg a expense to decrease in future periods as we decrease our retail subscriber acquisition costs by focusing our sales efforts on lower cost channels and we experience the full year effects of our recent cost containment measures  including the workforce reductions announced in november depreciation and amortization year ended percentage percentage december  change change in thousands  except percentages versus versus depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense primarily represents the depreciation recorded on pp e and amortization of intangible assets and definite lived owned spectrum

the increase in is primarily a result of new network assets placed into service to support our launches and continued network expansion 
the increase is also due to months depreciation and amortization expense recorded on assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of old clearwire  compared to approximately one month in for the period after the closing on november  we expect depreciation and amortization will continue to increase during as we record a full year of depreciation for assets put into service during in our new g markets

total spectrum lease expense increased in compared to as a direct result of a significant increase in the number of spectrum leases held by us 
we doubled the number of leased call signs when we acquired all of the old clearwire leases 
the increase is also due to months spectrum lease expense recorded on leases in for spectrum leases acquired from old clearwire  compared to approximately one month in for the period after the closing on november  while we do not expect to add a significant number of new spectrum leases in  we do expect our spectrum lease expense to increase 
as we renegotiate the existing leases  they are replaced with new leases  usually at a higher lease cost per month  but with longer terms 
loss from abandonment and impairment of network and other assets year ended december  in thousands  except percentages loss from abandonment and impairment of network and other assets to date  we have invested heavily in building  deploying and augmenting our networks 
in connection with the deployment of our networks  we have incurred substantial losses resulting from the abandonment of projects that cease to fit within management s strategic plans 
we identified projects undertaken in connection with our network build out for abandonment if they were not incorporated into our networks at launch and no longer fit within our future build plans 
for projects that were abandoned  the related costs were written down  resulting in a charge of approximately million 
during  we incurred approximately million for the abandonment of network projects that no longer met management s strategic network plans 
there were no charges recorded for abandonment of network projects for the year ended december  as we continue to revise our build plans in 
table of contents response to changes in our strategy  funding availability  technology and industry trends additional projects could be identified for abandonment  for which the associated write downs could be material 
additionally  during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge of million related to our indefinite lived spectrum assets in ireland in conjunction with our sale of those operations  as well as impairment losses of million related to network and other intangible assets in our international operations 
there were no impairment losses recorded in the years ended december  and transaction related expenses year ended december  in thousands  except percentages transaction related expenses transaction related expenses in include a one time million settlement loss resulting from the termination of spectrum lease agreements under which sprint leased spectrum to old clearwire prior to the closing 
as part of the closing  sprint contributed both the spectrum lease agreements and the spectrum assets underlying those agreements to our business 
as a result of the closing  the spectrum lease agreements were effectively terminated  and the settlement of those agreements was accounted for as a separate element apart from the business combination 
the settlement loss recognized from the termination was valued based on the amount by which the agreements were favorable or unfavorable to our business as compared to current market rates 
we had no comparable expenses in or interest expense year ended december  in thousands  except percentages interest expense we incurred million and million in gross interest costs during the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest costs were partially offset by capitalized interest of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest expense also includes adjustments to accrete our debt to par value 
the increase in interest expense for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in is due primarily to the issuance of the senior secured notes in november  which increased the outstanding principal balances by approximately billion during as compared to for the year ended december   we incurred twelve months of interest costs totaling million  which were partially offset by capitalized interest of million 
interest expense for included million of interest expense recorded on the note payable to sprint for the repayment of an obligation to reimburse sprint for financing the sprint wimax business between april  and the closing  which we refer to as the sprint pre closing financing amount  and one month of interest expense totaling million on the long term debt acquired from old clearwire 
we expect interest expense to increase next year compared to as we will incur a full year of interest costs for the additional billion of debt issued during december and a full year of accretion of the significant discount on the exchangeable notes resulting from separation of the exchange options 
in addition  capitalized interest is expected to be reduced as network expansion activities subside 
gain loss on derivative instruments year ended december  in thousands  except percentages gain loss on derivative instruments 
table of contents in connection with the issuance of the exchangeable notes in december  we recognized a derivative liability relating to the exchange options embedded in those notes with an estimated fair value at issuance of million 
the change in estimated fair value is required to be recognized in earnings during the period 
for the year ended december   we recorded a gain of million for the change in estimated fair value of the exchange options 
these instruments were not outstanding during and the million and million losses recorded during the years ended december  and december   respectively  were related to interest rate swap contracts which were used as economic hedges of the interest rate risk related to a portion of our senior term loan facility 
we terminated these swap contracts during the fourth quarter of in connection with the retirement of our senior term loan facility 
we expect the gain loss on derivative instruments to fluctuate significantly in due to the sensitivity of the estimated fair value of the exchange options to valuation inputs such as stock price and volatility

during the year ended december   we incurred other than temporary impairment losses of million related to these securities 
we acquired our other debt securities as a result of the acquisition of old clearwire on november  during november  we recorded a gain of million in connection with the retirement of our senior term loan facility and terminated the interest rate swap contracts 
income tax benefit provision year ended december  in thousands  except percentages income tax benefit provision the decrease in the income tax provision for compared to is primarily due to the change in our deferred tax position as a result of the disposition of certain foreign subsidiaries 
these foreign subsidiaries had deferred tax liabilities associated with their ownership of spectrum 
upon the sale of these subsidiaries  the amount of deferred tax liability was reduced and a benefit obtained 
the significant decrease in the income tax provision for compared to is primarily due to the change in our deferred tax position as a result of the closing 
prior to the closing  the income tax provision was primarily due to increased deferred liabilities from additional amortization taken for federal income tax purposes by the sprint wimax business on certain indefinite lived licensed spectrum 
as a result of the closing  the only united states temporary difference is the basis difference associated with our investment in clearwire communications  a partnership for united states income tax purposes 

table of contents non controlling interests in net loss of consolidated subsidiaries year ended december  in thousands  except percentages non controlling interests in net loss of consolidated subsidiaries the non controlling interests in net loss represent the allocation of a portion of the consolidated net loss to the non controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries based on the ownership by sprint  comcast  time warner cable  intel  bright house and eagle river of clearwire communications class b common units 
as of december   and  the non controlling interests share in net loss was  and  respectively 
approximately one month of losses was allocated to the non controlling interests in as there were no non controlling interests prior to the closing 
liquidity and capital resource requirements to date we have invested heavily in building and augmenting our g mobile broadband network 
during  we continued to develop and launch our g mobile broadband network in large metropolitan areas in the united states  including the fourth quarter launches of new york  san francisco and los angeles 
in  we plan to focus on improving the operating performance of our business while seeking to raise additional capital to continue the operation and expansion of our business and the development of our g mobile broadband network 
in  we received aggregate proceeds of approximately million from a rights offering that expired in june additionally  we entered into vendor financing and capital lease facilities allowing us to obtain up to million of financing 
notes may be entered into under a million vendor financing facility until january  we utilized million of this vendor financing facility in the proceeds were used to acquire equipment for the deployment of our g mobile broadband network 
capital leases with year lease terms may be entered into under a million capital lease facility until august  in addition to the above facilities  we also lease certain network construction equipment under capital leases with year lease terms 
as of december   approximately million of our outstanding debt  comprised of vendor financing and capital lease obligations  is secured by assets classified as network and base station equipment 
during december  clearwire communications issued additional million of senior secured notes with the same terms as the senior secured notes issued in december  and we completed an offering of million second priority secured notes due the second priority secured notes provide for bi annual payments of interest in june and december and bear interest at the rate of per annum 
during december  we also completed an offering of million exchangeable notes due the exchangeable notes may be redeemed in approximately years because the holders have the right  as of december   to require us to repurchase the notes and we have the right to redeem the notes at that time 
the exchangeable notes provide for bi annual payments of interest in june and december and bear interest at the rate of 
during the year ended december   we incurred billion of net losses 
we utilized billion of cash in operating activities and spent billion on capital expenditures in the development of our networks 
we do not expect our operations to generate positive cash flows during the next twelve months 
as of december   we had available cash and short term investment of approximately billion 
we believe that  as of december   we have cash and short term investments sufficient to cause our estimated liquidity needs to be satisfied for at least the next months based on our current plans as further discussed below 
over the next few years  we currently expect the actions we are taking will enable our current business to generate positive cash flows without the need for additional capital 
however  our current plans are based on a number of assumptions about our future performance  many of which are outside of our control and which may prove to be inaccurate 
these assumptions include  among other things  a favorable resolution of the current wholesale pricing disputes with sprint  continued increases in our wholesale subscriber base and increased usages by such subscribers  our ability to cause the services we offer over our g mobile broadband network to remain competitive with service offerings from our competitors  and our ability to reduce our operating expenses and capital expenditures 
if any of the assumptions underlying our plans prove to be incorrect and  as a result  our 
table of contents business fails to perform as we expect  we may require substantial additional capital in the near and long term to be able to continue to operate 
although our primary focus in is on operating our current business  we are seeking additional capital that would allow us to continue the development of our g mobile broadband network 
we will also continue to evaluate our plans and strategies  which may result in changes to our plans that could be material and that may significantly increase our capital requirements in the near and or long term 
these changes may include  among other things  improving our network coverage in markets we have previously launched by increasing site density and or our coverage area  modifying our sales and marketing strategy and or acquiring additional spectrum 
we also may elect to deploy alternative technologies to mobile wimax  such as lte  either in place of  or together with  mobile wimax if we determine it is necessary to cause the g mobile broadband services we offer to remain competitive or to expand the number and types of devices that may be used to access our services 
the amount and timing of any additional financings to satisfy our additional capital needs are difficult to estimate at this time 
if we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital that we may determine is necessary or desirable for our business  our business prospects  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
a special committee of our board of directors has been formed to explore sources of additional capital and to pursue other strategic alternatives for our business 
sources of additional capital could include issuing additional equity securities in public or private offerings or seeking additional debt financing 
any additional equity financing would be dilutive to our stockholders 
with our existing indebtedness  including the financing completed in  it may be difficult for us to obtain additional debt financing on acceptable terms or at all 
if we were successful in obtaining additional debt financing it would increase our future financial commitments 
we may also decide to sell additional equity or debt securities in our domestic or international subsidiaries  which may dilute our ownership interest in  or reduce or eliminate our income  if any  from those entities 
further  to satisfy our need for additional capital  as discussed above  we may elect to sell certain assets  which we believe are not essential to our business 
in the second half of  we initiated a process to seek bids for the potential sale of certain excess spectrum 
during the process  we received offers to purchase varying amounts of our spectrum from multiple parties  some of whom also expressed interest in exploring other strategic transactions 
currently  we are evaluating the offers received for our spectrum and holding discussions with the interested parties 
as a result  we have not yet made a determination as to whether to proceed with a sale  if any 
lastly  recent distress in the financial markets has resulted in extreme volatility in securities prices  diminished liquidity and credit availability and declining valuations of certain investments 
we have assessed the implications of these factors on our current business and determined that external factors have not had a significant impact to our financial position or liquidity during if the national or global economy or credit market conditions in general were to deteriorate in the future  it is possible that such changes could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional external financing 
cash flow analysis the following analysis includes the sources and uses of cash for the sprint wimax business for the first eleven months of prior to the closing and the sources and uses of cash for clearwire subsequent to the closing 
the statement of cash flows includes the activities that were paid by sprint on behalf of us prior to the closing

the increased operating expense payments were partially offset by an increase in cash collections from subscribers of approximately year over year 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million in the increase is primarily due to an increase in all operating expenses  as we continue to expand and operate our business  and interest payments to service debt 
this is partially offset by million in cash received from subscribers  which increased as we grew our subscribers and launched additional markets

table of contents options 
these are partially offset by payments of billion on our senior term loan facility  which was retired on november  our payment obligations under the senior secured notes  rollover notes and second priority notes are guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries on a senior basis and secured by certain assets of such subsidiaries on a first priority lien 
the senior secured notes  rollover notes and second priority notes contain limitations on our activities  which among other things include incurring additional indebtedness and guaranteeing indebtedness  making distributions or payment of dividends or certain other restricted payments or investments  making certain payments on indebtedness  entering into agreements that restrict distributions from restricted subsidiaries  selling or otherwise disposing of assets  merger  consolidation or sales of substantially all of our assets  entering transactions with affiliates  creating liens  issuing certain preferred stock or similar equity securities and making investments and acquiring assets

these are partially offset by million paid to sprint for partial reimbursement of the pre closing financing  a million debt financing fee and a million payment on our senior term loan facility 
contractual obligations the contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments as of december  changes in our business needs or interest rates  as well as actions by third parties and other factors  may cause these estimates to change 
because these estimates are complex and necessarily subjective  our actual payments in future periods are likely to vary from those presented in the table 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations including principal and interest payments under our debt obligations  payments under our spectrum lease obligations  and other contractual obligations as of december  in thousands less than contractual obligations total year years years over years long term debt obligations interest payments operating lease obligations spectrum lease obligations spectrum service credits capital lease obligations signed spectrum agreements network equipment purchase obligations other purchase obligations total includes executory costs of million 
payments include million representing interest 
network equipment purchase obligations represent purchase commitments with take or pay obligations and or volume commitments for equipment that are non cancelable and outstanding purchase orders for network equipment for which we believe delivery is likely to occur 
other purchase obligations include minimum purchases we have committed to purchase from suppliers over time and or unconditional purchase obligations where we guarantee to make a minimum payment to suppliers for goods and services regardless of whether suppliers fully deliver them 
they include  among other things  agreements for backhaul  subscriber devices and it related and other services 
the amounts actually paid under 
table of contents some of these other agreements will likely be higher than the minimum commitments due to variable components of these agreements 
the more significant variable components that determine the ultimate obligation owed include hours contracted  subscribers and other factors 
in addition  we are party to various arrangements that are conditional in nature and create an obligation to make payments only upon the occurrence of certain events  such as the actual delivery and acceptance of products or services 
because it is not possible to predict the timing or amounts that may be due under these conditional arrangements  no such amounts have been included in the table above 
the table above also excludes blanket purchase order amounts where the orders are subject to cancellation or termination at our discretion or where the quantity of goods or services to be purchased or the payment terms are unknown because such purchase orders are not firm commitments 
we do not have any obligations that meet the definition of an off balance sheet arrangement that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued new accounting guidance that amends the revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements and expands the disclosure requirements related to such arrangements 
the new guidance amends the criteria for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements  establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  eliminates the residual method of allocation  and requires the application of relative selling price method in allocating the arrangement consideration to all deliverables 
the new accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we will adopt the new accounting guidance beginning january  we do not anticipate the adoption of the new accounting guidance to have a significant effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  our stock price risk  foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the market value of investments due to credit risk 
interest rate risk our primary interest rate risk is associated with our cash equivalents and investment portfolio 
we presently invest primarily in money market mutual funds and united states government and agency issues maturing approximately months or less from the date of purchase 
our cash equivalent and investment portfolio has a weighted average maturity of months and a market yield of as of december  our primary interest rate risk exposure is to a decline in interest rates which would result in a decline in interest income 
due to the current market yield  a further decline in interest rates would have a de minimis impact on earnings 
we have long term fixed rate debt with a book value of billion and million of long term fixed rate capital lease obligations outstanding at december  the fair value of the debt fluctuates as interest rates change  however  there is no impact to earnings and cash flows as we expect to hold the debt  with the exception of the exchangeable notes  to maturity unless market and other factors are favorable 
the exchangeable notes  with a carrying value of million at december  and a maturity of  are expected to be redeemed in approximately years given on december   the holders have the right to require us to repurchase the notes and we have the right to redeem the notes 
we also have variable rate promissory notes which expose us to fluctuations in interest expense and payments caused by changes in interest rates 
at december   we had million aggregate principal outstanding of variable rate promissory notes whose interest rate resets quarterly based on the month libor rate 
a increase in the month libor rate would increase interest expense over the next twelve month period by approximately  
table of contents stock price risk the exchange options embedded in the exchangeable notes issued in december constitute derivative liabilities that are required to be separately accounted for from the debt host instrument at fair value 
input assumptions used to model the estimated fair value of the exchange options include our stock price  our stock s volatility and carrying costs 
the value of the exchange options are sensitive to both the price of our class a common stock and volatility of our stock 
holding all other pricing assumptions constant  an increase or decrease of on our stock price could result in a loss of million or a gain of million  respectively 
our stock s volatility is an input assumption requiring significant judgment 
holding all other pricing assumptions constant  an increase or decrease of in our estimated stock volatility could result in a loss of million or a gain of million  respectively 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as it relates to our international operations 
we currently do not hedge our currency exchange rate risk and  as such  we are exposed to fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar against other currencies 
our international subsidiaries and equity investees generally use the currency of the jurisdiction in which they reside  or local currency  as their functional currency 
assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and the resulting translation adjustments are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
income and expense accounts are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the reporting period 
the effects of changes in exchange rates between the designated functional currency and the currency in which a transaction is denominated are recorded as foreign currency transaction gains losses and recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
we believe that the fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
credit risk at december   we held available for sale short term and long term investments with a fair value and carrying value of million and a cost of million  comprised of united states government and agency issues and other debt securities 
we regularly review the carrying value of our short term and long term investments and identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are other than temporary 
approximately of our investments at december  were concentrated in united states treasury securities that are considered the least risky investment available to united states investors 
the remainder of our portfolio is primarily comprised of united states agency and other debentures 
the estimated fair values of these investments are subject to fluctuations due to volatility of the credit markets in general  company specific circumstances  changes in general economic conditions and use of management judgment when observable market prices and parameters are not fully available 
other debt securities are variable rate debt instruments whose interest rates are normally reset approximately every or days through an auction process 
a portion of our investments in other debt securities represent interests in collateralized debt obligations  which we refer to as cdos  supported by preferred equity securities of insurance companies and financial institutions with stated final maturity dates in and as of december  the total fair value and carrying value of our security interests in cdos was million and our cost was million 
we also own other debt securities  with a carrying value and cost of at december   that are auction rate market preferred securities issued by a monoline insurance company 
these securities are perpetual and do not have a final stated maturity
