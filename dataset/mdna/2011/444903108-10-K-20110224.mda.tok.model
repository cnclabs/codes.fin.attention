item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview human genome sciences  inc hgs is a biopharmaceutical company that exists to place new therapies into the hands of those battling serious disease 
our lead products in development are benlysta belimumab for systemic lupus erythematosus sle and raxibacumab for inhalation anthrax 
benlysta continues to progress toward commercialization 
on november   the us food and drug administration fda arthritis advisory committee voted to recommend that the fda approve benlysta for the treatment of autoantibody positive patients with active sle who are receiving standard therapy 
the advisory committee provides non binding recommendations for consideration by the fda  which then makes the final decision on approval 
in december  the fda extended the prescription drug user fee act pdufa target date for its priority review of benlysta from december  to march  in june  glaxosmithkline gsk  our partner in the co development and commercialization of benlysta  submitted a marketing authorization application maa to the european medicines agency ema for approval to market benlysta in europe 
we expect to have the ema decision in the second half of gsk has also submitted regulatory applications in canada  australia  switzerland  russia  brazil and the philippines 
regulatory submissions in other countries are planned in in preparation for the anticipated launch and commercialization of benlysta  we have hired and trained a specialized commercial team including sales  marketing and medical affairs 
we are also building our own hgs commercial team to work alongside gsk in europe 
we believe we have produced sufficient benlysta inventory to meet the anticipated global market need for at least one year  and are increasing our capacity to meet long term demand 
we continue to deliver raxibacumab to the us strategic national stockpile sns for emergency use in treating inhalation anthrax 
in  we completed the delivery of  doses of raxibacumab to the sns under an initial order and as a result recognized million in product sales and manufacturing and development services revenue 
in july  the us government usg exercised its option to purchase  additional doses of raxibacumab  with delivery to be completed over a three year period 
hgs expects to receive approximately million from this second order as deliveries are completed  million of which has been recognized as revenue through december  in may  we submitted a biologics license application bla to the fda for raxibacumab for the treatment of inhalation anthrax 
we received a complete response letter in november  and we will continue to work closely with the fda to obtain approval 
hgs will receive approximately million from the usg upon fda licensure of raxibacumab 
in addition to these products in our internal pipeline  we have substantial financial rights to two novel drugs that gsk has advanced to late stage development 
the first of these is darapladib  which was discovered by gsk using hgs technology 
in two pivotal phase trials  gsk is currently evaluating whether darapladib can reduce the risk of adverse cardiovascular events such as heart attack or stroke in patients with chronic coronary heart disease and acute coronary syndrome  respectively 
with a planned enrollment of more than  patients in the two trials  the phase clinical program for darapladib is among the largest ever conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of any cardiovascular medication 
the second is albiglutide 
gsk currently has eight phase trials in progress to evaluate the long term efficacy  safety and tolerability of albiglutide as monotherapy and add on therapy for patients with type diabetes mellitus 
albiglutide was created by hgs using its proprietary albumin fusion technology  and the product was licensed to gsk in we are also working to expand and advance our mid and early stage pipeline beyond potential additional indications for benlysta  with a primary focus on immunology and oncology 
we continue to develop our oncology portfolio around our expertise in the apoptosis  or programmed cell death  pathway and we plan to initiate phase development of our human monoclonal antibody to the ccr receptor for the treatment of ulcerative colitis 
overview continued we and novartis were developing zalbin tm for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis c 
in the fda expressed concerns regarding the risk benefit assessment of zalbin dosed at mcg every two weeks 
based on the fda and similar ema feedback  we and novartis decided to end further development of zalbin in strategic partnerships are an important driver of our commercial success 
we have a co development and commercialization agreement with gsk for benlysta  and raxibacumab is being developed under a contract with the biomedical advanced research and development authority of the office of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response  us department of health and human services 
our strategic partnerships with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies allow us to leverage our strengths and gain access to sales and marketing infrastructure  as well as complementary technologies 
some of these partnerships provide us with licensing or other fees  clinical development cost sharing  milestone payments and rights to royalty payments as products are developed and commercialized 
in some cases  we are entitled to certain commercialization  co promotion  revenue sharing and other product rights 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
such judgments are often the result of a need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
see note b  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we currently believe the following accounting policies to be critical investments 
we account for investments in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification fasb asc topic  investments debt and equity securities 
we carry our investments at their respective fair values 
we periodically evaluate the fair values of our investments to determine whether any declines in the fair value of investments represent an other than temporary impairment 
this evaluation consists of a review of several factors  including but not limited to the length of time and extent that a security has been in an unrealized loss position  the existence of an event that would impair the issuer s future repayment potential  the near term prospects for recovery of the market value of a security and our intent to hold the security until the market value recovers  which may be maturity 
we also evaluate whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery 
if management determines that such an impairment exists we would recognize an impairment charge 
because we may determine that market or business conditions may lead us to sell a short term investment or marketable security prior to maturity  we classify our short term investments and marketable securities as available for sale 
investments in securities that are classified as available for sale and have readily determinable fair values are measured at fair market value in the balance sheets  and unrealized holding gains and losses for these investments are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized  or an other than temporary impairment is recorded 
we classify those marketable securities that may be used in operations within one year as short term investments 
those marketable securities in which we have both the ability to hold until maturity and have a maturity date beyond one year from our most recent consolidated balance sheet date are classified as non current marketable securities 
for investments carried at fair value  we disclose the level within the fair value hierarchy as prescribed by fasb asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures 
we evaluate the types of securities in our investment portfolio to determine the proper classification in the fair value hierarchy based on trading activity and the observability of market inputs 
we generally obtain a single quote or price per instrument from independent third parties to help us determine the fair value of securities in level and level of the fair value hierarchy 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates continued inventories 
inventories  which are recorded at the lower of cost or market  include materials  labor and other direct and indirect costs and are valued using the first in  first out method 
the company capitalizes inventories produced in preparation for product launches when the related product candidates are considered likely to receive regulatory approval and it is probable that the related costs will be recoverable through the commercialization of the product 
leases 
we lease various real properties under operating leases that generally require us to pay taxes  insurance and maintenance 
during  we entered into a year lease agreement with biomed realty trust  inc biomed for our traville facility 
we account for the traville lease with biomed as an operating lease 
during and as described further in note f  long term debt  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we sold our large scale manufacturing facility lsm and headquarters land to biomed  and simultaneously agreed to lease such assets back over years 
we recorded the sale and leaseback of these assets as a financing transaction and accordingly recorded the allocated sale proceeds as outstanding debt on our balance sheet 
we account for lease payments under the related lease agreements as principal and interest payments on this debt 
impairments of long lived assets 
long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount the assets  the assets are written down to their estimated fair values 
long lived assets to be sold are carried at fair value less costs to sell 
product sales 
revenue from product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable  collection from the customer is reasonably assured  and we have no further performance obligations 
manufacturing and development services 
we have entered into agreements for manufacturing process development  clinical and commercial supply of certain biopharmaceutical products 
revenue under these agreements is recognized as services are performed or products delivered  depending on the nature of the work contracted  using a proportional performance method of accounting 
performance is assessed using output measures such as units of work performed to date as compared to total units of work contracted 
advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 
research and development collaborative agreements 
our revenue recognition policies for all non refundable up front license fees and milestone arrangements are in accordance with the guidance provided in fasb asc topic  revenue recognition 
fasb asc topic provides guidance on when an arrangement that involves multiple revenue generating activities or deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if this division is required  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
if the deliverables in a revenue arrangement constitute separate units of accounting according to fasb asc topic s separation criteria  the revenue recognition policy must be determined for each identified unit 
if the arrangement is a single unit of accounting  the revenue recognition policy must be determined for the entire arrangement 
under arrangements where the license fees and research and development activities cannot be accounted for as separate units of accounting  non refundable up front license fees are deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the expected term of our continued involvement in the research and development process 
revenues from the achievement of research and development milestones  if deemed substantive  are recognized as revenue when the milestones are achieved  and the milestone payments are due and collectible 
if not deemed substantive  we would recognize such milestones as revenue on a straight line basis over the remaining expected term of continued involvement in the research and development process 
milestones are considered substantive if all of the following conditions are met the milestone is non refundable  critical accounting policies and the use of estimates continued achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved to achieve the milestone  and  the amount of the milestone appears reasonable in relation to the effort expended  the other milestones in the arrangement and the related risk associated with the achievement of the milestone and any ongoing research and development or other services are priced at fair value 
payments received in advance of work performed are recorded as deferred revenue 
the up front license fee and expense reimbursement received in from novartis in connection with zalbin along with subsequently received milestones were recognized ratably over the estimated four year clinical development period ending in our initial payment from gsk in connection with benlysta was recognized ratably over the estimated four year clinical development period ending in our up front license fee with gsk in connection with albiglutide is being recognized ratably over the estimated eight year clinical development period ending in our revenues from other research and development collaborative agreements in  and have generally been recognized in full upon receipt  as we have met the criteria for recognition 
research and development 
research and development expenses primarily include related salaries  outside services  materials and supplies and allocated facility costs 
such costs are charged to research and development expense as incurred 
our drug development expenses include accruals for clinical site and clinical research organization cro costs 
estimates of the incurred to date but not yet received invoices must be made for clinical site and cro costs in determining the accrued balance in any accounting period 
reimbursement of research and development expenses received in connection with collaborative cost sharing agreements is recorded as a reduction of such expenses 
stock compensation 
we have a stock incentive plan the incentive plan under which options to purchase shares of our common stock may be granted to employees  consultants and directors at a price no less than the quoted market value on the date of grant 
the incentive plan also provides for awards in the form of stock appreciation rights  restricted non vested or unrestricted stock awards  stock equivalent units or performance based stock awards 
we account for share based awards to employees and non employee directors pursuant to fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation  which requires that compensation cost resulting from share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements at fair value over the service period 
the amount of compensation expense recognized using the fair value method requires us to exercise judgment and make assumptions relating to the factors that determine the fair value of our stock option grants 
we use the black scholes merton model to estimate the fair value of our option grants 
the fair value calculated by this model is a function of several factors  including grant price  the risk free interest rate  the estimated term of the option and the estimated future volatility of the option 
the estimated term and estimated future volatility of the options require our judgment 
exit accruals 
in  we exited certain facilities  including certain headquarters space wing c  which required us to make significant estimates in several areas including the realizable values of assets deemed redundant or excess and the ability to generate sublease income 
we evaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis and adjust the accrued exit expenses if there is a material change in the estimates used or if there is a material change in the facts and circumstances relating to the accrual 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such amounts are expected to reverse or be utilized 
the realization of total deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is provided to reduce such deferred tax assets to amounts more likely than not to be ultimately realized 
in determining the effective income tax rate  we analyze various factors  including projections of our annual earnings and taxing jurisdictions in which the earnings will be generated  the impact of state and local and foreign income taxes and our ability to use tax incentives 
we file income tax returns in us federal  state and foreign critical accounting policies and the use of estimates continued jurisdictions 
our income taxes have not been subject to examination by any tax jurisdictions since its inception 
accordingly  all our filed income tax returns are subject to examination by the taxing jurisdictions 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues 
we had revenues of million and million for and  respectively 
revenues for consisted primarily of million recognized from novartis primarily relating to recognition of all remaining unrecognized up front license fees and milestones due to the decision to end further development of zalbin  as well as million in raxibacumab product sales and million from contract manufacturing services 
revenues for consisted primarily of million in raxibacumab product sales  million recognized from novartis related to straight line recognition of up front license fees and milestones reached for zalbin  million related to raxibacumab development services and million from contract manufacturing services 
cost of sales 
cost of sales includes both cost of product sales of million and cost of manufacturing and development services of million for cost of sales includes both cost of product sales of million and cost of manufacturing and development services of million for cost of product sales for includes the cost of manufacturing raxibacumab and royalties whereas the cost of product sales for included only royalties  as the manufacturing costs had been previously expensed 
cost of product sales for also includes amounts expensed related to rejected or terminated production batches 
our manufacturing and development services costs include costs associated with contract manufacturing services and raxibacumab development services costs 
the decrease in manufacturing and development services costs is primarily due to reduced contract manufacturing activities 
expenses 
research and development expenses were million for as compared to million for our research and development expenses for are net of million of costs primarily reimbursed by gsk and novartis 
our research and development expenses for are net of million of costs reimbursed by gsk and novartis 
we track our research and development expenditures by type of cost incurred research  pharmaceutical sciences  manufacturing and clinical development costs 
our research costs amounted to million for as compared to million for this increase is primarily due to activity related to hgs and new target development 
our research costs for and are net of million and million  respectively  of cost reimbursement primarily from gsk and novartis under cost sharing provisions in our collaboration agreements 
our pharmaceutical sciences costs  where we focus on improving formulation  process development and production methods  decreased to million for from million for this decrease is primarily due to decreased activity related to contract manufacturing services and zalbin  partially offset by increased benlysta activity 
pharmaceutical sciences costs for include million of net costs incurred by gsk and novartis 
pharmaceutical sciences costs for are net of million of cost reimbursement from gsk and novartis under cost sharing provisions in our collaboration agreements 
our manufacturing costs increased to million for from million for this increase is primarily due to increased benlysta production partially offset by decreased zalbin activity and capitalization of raxibacumab manufacturing costs in our manufacturing costs for and are net of million and million  respectively  of anticipated cost reimbursement from gsk and novartis under the cost sharing provisions in our collaboration agreements 
manufacturing costs incurred to produce benlysta prior to the fda advisory committee vote to recommend approval were expensed as incurred 
our clinical development costs decreased to million for from million for the decrease is primarily due to the completion of our first benlysta phase clinical trial in  completion of our second phase benlysta clinical trial in march and decreased raxibacumab development activities 
our clinical results of operations continued years ended december  and continued development costs for and are net of million and million  respectively  of cost reimbursement from gsk and novartis under cost sharing provisions in our collaboration agreements 
the research and development expenditures noted above are categorized by functional area 
we evaluate and prioritize our activities according to functional area  rather than on a per project basis 
for this reason  we do not maintain a formal accounting system that captures or allocates all costs  both direct and indirect  on a per project basis 
therefore  we do not believe that our available project by project information would form a reasonable basis for disclosure to investors 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for this increase is primarily due to increased commercial readiness activities  such as market research and additional personnel including our sales force  which was hired in late general and administrative expenses in future periods are likely to increase as the level of commercial activities rises 
facility related exit charges of million for relate to an adjustment to our exit reserve for wing c 
see note j  facility related exit charges  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
investment income increased to million for from million for the increase is primarily due to higher average investment balances partially offset by lower yields on our portfolio 
investment income also includes realized net losses on our short term investments  marketable securities and restricted investments of million for as compared to net losses of million for the yield on our investments was approximately for  as compared to approximately for a general decline in interest rates may adversely affect the interest earned from our portfolio as securities mature and may be replaced with securities having a lower interest rate 
interest expense increased to million for compared to million for interest expense includes non cash interest expense related to amortization of debt discount of million and million for and  respectively  as a result of the adoption of fasb asc which requires that the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects an issuer s non convertible debt borrowing rate 
the gain on extinguishment of debt of million for relates to the repurchase of convertible subordinated debt due in and with a face value of approximately million for an aggregate cost of approximately million plus accrued interest 
the gain on extinguishment of debt is net of write offs of related debt discount of million and deferred financing charges of million 
the gain on sale of long term equity investment for of million relates to the sale of our investment in cogenesys  inc cogenesys 
the agreement between cogenesys and teva pharmaceutical industries ltd 
teva provided for an escrow of a portion of the purchase price 
we received the final payment for our equity investment during and recorded a gain of million with respect to this escrow 
we recorded other income of million for  and other expense of million for income tax benefit 
income tax benefit of million for represents a credit received in of million for and an accrued income tax benefit of million for we elected to accelerate recognition of research and development tax credits by electing out of bonus depreciation pursuant to regulations passed in net income loss 
we recorded a net loss of million  or per basic and diluted share  for  compared to net income of million  or per share  for the change from net income to net loss is primarily due to lower product sales and manufacturing and development services revenue in versus and results of operations continued years ended december  and continued the gain on extinguishment of debt in  partially offset by increased revenue recognized from the novartis agreement in years ended december  and revenues 
we had revenues of million and million for and  respectively 
revenues for consisted primarily of million in raxibacumab product sales  million related to raxibacumab development services  million from contract manufacturing services and million recognized from novartis related to straight line recognition of up front license fees and milestones reached for zalbin 
revenues for consisted primarily of million recognized from novartis related to straight line recognition of up front license fees and milestones reached for zalbin and million recognized from gsk related to straight line recognition of an up front fee for benlysta 
revenue recognized from novartis increased in due to receipt of a million milestone which was being recognized over the remaining development period  ending in the fall of cost of sales 
cost of sales includes both cost of product sales of million and cost of manufacturing and development services of million for no cost of sales were incurred in as we had no revenue from product sales or manufacturing and development services 
with respect to the initial order for raxibacumab  we incurred substantially all of the product and service costs prior to  and expensed these costs as incurred 
we incurred royalty costs associated with the initial order during  which are included in cost of product sales 
in addition  we have recorded as cost of product sales the expenses associated with manufacturing additional raxibacumab incurred prior to receiving the follow on order in july our manufacturing and development service costs include raxibacumab development service costs incurred in and costs associated with contract manufacturing services 
after approval of a product  inventoriable costs are capitalized into inventory and will be expensed as the inventory is sold

we track our research and development expenditures by type of cost incurred research  pharmaceutical sciences  manufacturing and clinical development costs 
our research costs amounted to million for as compared to million for this decrease is primarily due to the conclusion of animal studies being conducted for raxibacumab in  and a million milestone payment made to aegera therapeutics  inc aegera in our research costs for and are net of million and million  respectively  of cost reimbursement from novartis and gsk under cost sharing provisions in our collaboration agreements 
our pharmaceutical sciences costs  where we focus on improving formulation  process development and production methods  decreased to million for from million for this decrease is primarily due to decreased activity related to raxibacumab and zalbin  partially offset by increased activity related to contract manufacturing services 
pharmaceutical sciences costs for and are net of million and million  respectively  of cost reimbursement from novartis and gsk under cost sharing provisions in our collaboration agreements 
our manufacturing costs decreased to million for from million for this decrease is primarily due to capitalizing raxibacumab production costs beginning in and decreased production of raxibacumab  zalbin and benlysta  partially offset by increased manufacturing services activities 
our manufacturing costs for and are net of million and million  respectively  of anticipated cost reimbursement from novartis and gsk under the commercial cost sharing provisions in our collaboration agreements 
results of operations continued years ended december  and continued our clinical development costs decreased to million for from million for this decrease is primarily due to the substantial completion of our zalbin phase clinical trials in late  completion of the first phase benlysta clinical trial and wind down of the second phase benlysta clinical trial during and decreased hgs etr clinical trial costs 
our clinical development costs for and are net of million and million  respectively  of cost reimbursement from novartis and gsk under cost sharing provisions in our collaboration agreements 
the research and development expenditures noted above are categorized by functional area 
we evaluate and prioritize our activities according to functional area  rather than on a per project basis 
for this reason  we do not maintain a formal accounting system that captures or allocates all costs  both direct and indirect  on a per project basis 
therefore  we do not believe that our available project by project information would form a reasonable basis for disclosure to investors 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for this increase is primarily due to increased pre commercial launch activities  partially offset by decreased legal expenses associated with our patents 
facility related exit charges of million for relate to an adjustment to our exit reserve for wing c 
our wing c subtenant terminated its lease during  which resulted in an exit charge of million during the second quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we decided to resume production activities in most of wing c and accordingly  reversed million of the million charge  resulting in a net exit charge of million for the full year 
during  we did not incur any facility related exit charges 
see note j  facility related exit charges  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
investment income decreased to million for from million for the decrease is primarily due to lower yields in as compared to  partially offset by higher average investment balances 
investment income also includes realized net losses on our short term investments  marketable securities and restricted investments of million for as compared to net gains of million for the yield on our investments was approximately for  as compared to approximately for interest expense decreased to million for compared to million for interest expense includes non cash interest expense related to amortization of debt discount of million and million for and  respectively  as a result of the adoption of fasb asc topic which requires that the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects an issuer s non convertible debt borrowing rate 
the decrease in interest expense is primarily due to the february repurchase of convertible subordinated debt due in and the gain on extinguishment of debt of million for relates to the repurchase of convertible subordinated debt due in and with a face value of approximately million for an aggregate cost of approximately million plus accrued interest 
the gain on extinguishment of debt is net of write offs of related debt discount of million and deferred financing charges of million 
the gain on sale of long term equity investment for and of million and million respectively  relates to the sale of our investment in cogenesys 
we received initial proceeds in of million 
our cost basis in this investment was million  resulting in a gain of million 
the agreement between cogenesys and teva provided for an escrow of a portion of the purchase price 
we received the final payment for our equity investment during and recorded an additional gain of million 
other expense of million for primarily represents unrealized  non cash foreign currency translation losses related to our investment in aegera  which is denominated in canadian dollars 
other expense of million for was due to an other than temporary impairment of our investment in debt securities issued by lehman results of operations continued years ended december  and continued brothers holdings  inc lbhi 
during  lbhi experienced a significant deterioration in its credit worthiness and filed a petition under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
income tax benefit 
income tax benefit of million represents a credit received in of million for and an accrued income tax benefit of million for we elected to accelerate recognition of research and development tax credits by electing out of bonus depreciation pursuant to regulations passed in net income loss 
we recorded net income of million  or per basic and diluted share  for  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the improvement to net income from a net loss is primarily due to activity including revenue from raxibacumab  gain on extinguishment of debt and reduced research and development expenses 
liquidity and capital resources we had working capital of million as of december  compared to working capital of million as of december  the decrease in our working capital is primarily due to the use of working capital to fund our operations and the classification of million of our convertible subordinated notes due as a current liability as of december  compared to non current as of december  we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses relating to our research and development efforts  as we focus on clinical trials and manufacturing required for the development of our active product candidates 
we will also continue to incur costs related to our pre and post commercial launch activities  and will incur significant sales and marketing costs if benlysta is approved 
in the event our working capital needs exceed our available working capital  we can utilize our non current marketable securities  which are classified as available for sale 
in  the usg agreed to purchase  additional doses of raxibacumab for the sns  to be delivered over a three year period  which began in we expect to receive a total of approximately million from this order as deliveries are completed  million of which was recognized as revenue through we may also receive payments under collaboration agreements  to the extent milestones are met  which would further improve our working capital position 
we continue to evaluate our working capital position on an ongoing basis 
to minimize our exposure to credit risk  we invest in securities with strong credit ratings and have established guidelines relative to diversification and maturity with the objectives of maintaining safety of principal and liquidity 
we do not invest in derivative financial instruments or auction rate securities  and we generally hold our investments in debt securities until maturity 
the amounts of expenditures that will be needed to carry out our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
we have completed our fourth phase trial and have several ongoing phase and phase trials and expect to initiate additional trials in the future 
the duration and cost of our clinical trials are a function of numerous factors such as the number of patients to be enrolled in the trial  the amount of time it takes to enroll them  the length of time they must be treated and observed  and the number of clinical sites and countries for the trial 
however  the duration of these phases may vary considerably according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of the drug candidate 
some trials may take considerably longer to complete 
liquidity and capital resources continued our clinical development expenses are impacted by the clinical phase of our drug candidates 
our expenses increase as our drug candidates move to later phases of clinical development 
the status of our clinical projects is as follows clinical trial status as of december  product candidate indication benlysta systemic lupus erythematosus phase phase phase benlysta rheumatoid arthritis phase phase raxibacumab anthrax hgs cancer phase phase phase hgs etr cancer phase phase phase zalbin hepatitis c phase phase hgs etr cancer phase includes only those candidates for which an investigational new drug application ind has been filed with the fda 
clinical trial status defined as when patients are being dosed 
results from two phase clinical trials reported  maa and bla filed in june  bla pdufa target date of march  phase trial completed  treatment ind ongoing 
bla filed in  complete response letter received from fda  additional work ongoing 
further development discontinued 
ongoing phase trial by national institutes of health  further development not anticipated 
we identify our drug candidates by conducting numerous preclinical studies 
we may conduct multiple clinical trials to cover a variety of indications for each drug candidate 
based upon the results from our trials  we may elect to discontinue clinical trials for certain indications or certain drugs in order to concentrate our resources on more promising drug candidates 
we are advancing a number of drug candidates  including antibodies  and a small molecule  in part to diversify the risks associated with our research and development spending 
in addition  our manufacturing plants have been designed to enable multi product manufacturing capability 
we must receive regulatory clearance to advance each of our products into and through each phase of clinical testing 
moreover  we must receive regulatory approval to launch any of our products commercially 
in order to receive such approval  the appropriate regulatory agency must conclude that our clinical data establish safety and efficacy and that our products and the manufacturing facilities meet all applicable regulatory requirements 
we cannot be certain that we will establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to receive regulatory approval for any of our drugs or that our drugs and the manufacturing facilities will meet all applicable regulatory requirements 
part of our business plan includes collaborating with others 
for example  we entered into a collaboration agreement with gsk in with respect to benlysta and received a payment of million 
we and gsk share phase and development costs  and share sales and marketing expenses and profits of any product that is commercialized in accordance with the collaboration agreement 
we also entered into a collaboration agreement with novartis in during  we recorded approximately million due primarily from gsk and novartis with respect to our cost sharing agreements as a reduction of research and development expenses 
we recognized the up front fees and milestones received from gsk and novartis as revenue ratably over the estimated remaining development periods 
based on the decision in september to end further development of zalbin  all remaining deferred revenue related to the payments received from novartis was recognized 
furthermore  we will not be receiving any of the remaining million in milestone payments from novartis with respect to zalbin 
liquidity and capital resources continued we have collaborators who have sole responsibility for product development 
for example  gsk is developing other products under separate agreements as part of our overall relationship with them 
we have no control over the progress of gsk s development plans 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether any of our current or future collaborations will affect our drug development 
because of the uncertainties discussed above  the costs to advance our research and development projects are difficult to estimate and may vary significantly 
our long term strategy includes the acquisition of other biotechnology companies or in license of additional product candidates to complement and supplement our existing product pipeline  and we may acquire such companies and in license additional product candidates that have demonstrated positive pre clinical and or clinical data 
any such acquisition or in license agreement could include consideration in the form of cash  which would have an adverse effect on our liquidity 
we expect that our existing funds  payments received under the raxibacumab contract and other agreements and investment income will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  primarily including the scope and costs of our clinical development programs  the scope and costs of our manufacturing and process development activities  the magnitude of our discovery and preclinical development programs and the level of our pre and post commercial launch activities 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing required in the future will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
depending upon market and interest rate conditions  we may take actions to strengthen further our financial position 
we may undertake financings and may repurchase or restructure some or all of our outstanding convertible debt instruments in the future depending upon market and other conditions 
during we repurchased approximately million of our convertible subordinated debt due in and at a cost of approximately million plus accrued interest

our operating leases  along with our unconditional purchase obligations  are not recorded on our balance sheets 
debt associated with the sale of our lsm to biomed and accompanying leaseback is recorded on our balance sheet as of december  and we have an option to purchase the traville facility in for million 
this is not reflected in the contractual obligations table below because we are not obligated to exercise this option

our other products are in either phase or phase and would also obligate us to make certain milestone payments should they reach phase or regulatory approval 
these other payments could result in aggregate milestone payments of million 
because we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether any of these products will reach these milestones  we have excluded these amounts and any royalty payments  except for those royalty payments related to raxibacumab sales under the current order from the usg  from the above table

liquidity and capital resources continued such investments reflect our policy regarding the investment of liquid assets  which is to seek a reasonable rate of return consistent with an emphasis on safety  liquidity and preservation of capital 
off balance sheet arrangements during and  we entered into two long term leases with the maryland economic development corporation medco expiring january  for a small scale manufacturing facility aggregating  square feet and built to our specifications 
we have accounted for these leases as operating leases 
the facility was financed primarily through a combination of bonds issued by medco medco bonds and loans issued to medco by certain state of maryland agencies 
we have no equity interest in medco 
rent is based upon medco s debt service obligations and annual base rent under the leases is currently approximately million 
the medco bonds are secured by letters of credit issued for the account of medco which were renewed in december we are required to have restricted investments of approximately million which serve as security for the medco letters of credit reimbursement obligation 
upon default or early lease termination  the medco bond indenture trustee can draw upon the letters of credit to pay the medco bonds as they are tendered 
in such an event  we could lose part or all of our restricted investments and could record a charge to earnings for a corresponding amount 
alternatively  we have an option through the end of the lease term to purchase this facility for an aggregate amount that declines from approximately million in to approximately million in safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of certain statements contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not currently have operations of a material nature that are subject to risks of foreign currency fluctuations 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our operations or investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio may be comprised of low risk us treasuries  government sponsored enterprise securities  high grade debt having at least an a rating at time of purchase and various money market instruments 
the short term nature of these securities  which currently have an average term of approximately months  decreases the risk of a material loss caused by a market change related to interest rates 
we believe that a hypothetical basis point adverse move increase in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would adversely affect the fair value of our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  marketable securities and restricted investments by approximately million  or approximately of the aggregate fair value of million  as of december  for these reasons  and because these securities are generally held to maturity  we believe we do not have significant exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates related to our debt securities held as of december  we believe that any interest rate change related to our investment securities held as of december  is not material to our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   the yield on comparable one year investments was approximately  as compared to our current portfolio yield of approximately 
however  given the short term nature of these securities  a general decline in interest rates may adversely affect the interest earned from our portfolio as securities mature and may be replaced with securities having a lower interest rate 
to minimize our exposure to credit risk  we invest in securities with strong credit ratings and have established guidelines relative to diversification and maturity with the objectives of maintaining safety of principal and liquidity 
we do not invest in derivative financial instruments  auction rate securities  loans held for sale or mortgage backed securities backed by sub prime or alt a collateral  and we generally hold our investments in debt securities until maturity 
however  adverse changes in the credit markets relating to credit risks would adversely affect the fair value of our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  marketable securities and restricted investments 
our facility leases for our traville headquarters and lsm require us to maintain minimum levels of restricted investments of approximately million  or million if in the form of cash  as collateral for these facilities 
together with the requirement to maintain approximately million in restricted investments with respect to our small scale manufacturing facility leases  our overall level of restricted investments is currently required to be approximately million 
although the market value for these investments may rise or fall as a result of changes in interest rates  we will be required to maintain this level of restricted investments in either a rising or declining interest rate environment 
our convertible subordinated notes bear interest at fixed rates 
as a result  our interest expense on these notes is not affected by changes in interest rates 
our wholly owned subsidiary  human genome sciences europe gmbh hgs europe assists in our clinical trials and clinical research collaborations in european countries 
although hgs europe s activities are denominated primarily in euros  we believe the foreign currency fluctuation risks to be immaterial to our operations as a whole 
our wholly owned subsidiary  human genome sciences pacific pty ltd 
hgs pacific sponsors some of our clinical trials in the asia pacific region 
we currently do not anticipate hgs pacific to have any operational activity and therefore we do not believe we will have any foreign currency fluctuation risks with respect to hgs pacific 
during we formed additional european subsidiaries in preparation for commercial activity in that region 
the formation of these subsidiaries slightly increases our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation risks  as they are predominantly denominated in euros 
we do not believe the risk of foreign currency gains or losses to be material to our overall operations
