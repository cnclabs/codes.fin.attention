our ability to finance  consummate and integrate acquisitions 
introduction we manufacture  both domestically and internationally  a wide array of specialty papers and fiber based engineered materials 
we manage our company along three business units specialty papers with revenues earned from the sale of carbonless papers and forms  book publishing  envelope converting  and engineered products  composite fibers with revenue from the sale of food beverage filtration papers  metallized papers  composite laminates used for decorative furniture and flooring applications  and technical specialties  and advanced airlaid materials with revenue from the sale of airlaid non woven fabric like materials used in feminine hygiene products  adult incontinence products  cleaning pads and wipes  food pads  napkins and tablecloths  and baby wipes 
overview on february   we completed the acquisition of concert industries corp 
concert  a manufacturer of highly absorbent cellulose based airlaid non woven materials with annual revenue in of million 
our results of operations for include the results of concert now operated as the advanced airlaid materials business unit prospectively since the acquisition was completed 

table of contents our reported results of operations for when compared to are lower primarily due to the higher amount of tax related credits recorded in than in associated with cellulosic or alternative fuel mixtures 
for  net income included a million tax benefit from cellulosic biofuel credits compared to million  after tax  alternative fuel mixture credits during our results include million  after tax  of acquisition and integration costs  together with a million loss on forward foreign currency contracts that hedged the canadian dollar purchase price  of the concert acquisition 
interest expense increased million in compared to due to financing part of the acquisition price 
operationally  our results were favorably affected by higher volumes shipped associated with improving demand in many of the markets served by our businesses and the inclusion of concert 
higher average selling prices offset the adverse affect of rising input costs  particularly purchased pulp 
specialty papers operating income totaled million and million for and  respectively 
the improvement in operating income was led by higher volumes shipped  higher average selling prices  productivity improvements and cost reduction initiatives partially offset by lower sales of excess energy and renewable energy credits 
during  the weak economic environment adversely affected demand in all markets served by specialty papers 
as a result of weak demand in the first half of the year and our efforts to reduce inventory  this unit incurred market related downtime totaling  tons of paper 
our composite fibers business unit s operating income increased to million from million in volumes shipped during increased compared to as a result of the improving economic environment 
conversely  during  as a result of weak demand and our inventory reduction efforts  we incurred unscheduled downtime totaling approximately  tons of paper  or of the unit s total capacity for the period 
advanced airlaid materials earned million of operating income on sales of million for the ten and one half months of operations since the date of acquisition 
the results were adversely impacted primarily by rapidly rising input costs  a lag in the timing of cost pass throughs and currency fluctuations

business units results of individual business units are presented based on our management accounting practices and management structure 
there is no comprehensive  authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  therefore  the financial results of individual business units are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company 
the management accounting process uses assumptions and allocations to measure performance of the business units 
methodologies are refined from time to time as management accounting practices are enhanced and businesses change 
the costs incurred by support areas not directly aligned with the business unit are allocated primarily based on an estimated utilization of support area services or are included in other and unallocated in the business unit performance table 
management evaluates results of operations of the business units before pension income or expense  alternative fuel mixture credits  charges related to the fox river environmental reserves  restructuring related charges  unusual items  certain corporate level costs  and the effects of asset dispositions 
management believes that glatfelter annual report

such amounts are presented under the caption other and unallocated 
this presentation is aligned with the management and operating structure of our company 
it is also on this basis that the company s performance is evaluated internally and by the company s board of directors

in the specialty papers business unit  net sales for increased million  or  to million 
the increase was primarily due to higher volumes shipped and a million benefit from higher selling prices 
specialty papers operating profit for improved by million compared with primarily due to higher selling prices  a increase in volumes shipped and the lack of market related downtime 
these favorable factors were partially offset by higher input costs  primarily pulp 
in addition  higher maintenance costs largely associated with the annual mill outages and with unplanned production interruptions adversely impacted the year over year comparison 
we sell excess power generated by the spring grove  pa facility 
in addition  two of our facilities are registered generators of renewable energy credits recs 
the following table summarizes this activity for and in thousands change energy sales costs to produce net renewable energy credits total recs represent sales of certified credits earned related to burning renewable sources of energy such as black liquor and wood waste 
we sell recs into an emerging and somewhat illiquid market 
the extent and value of future revenues from rec sales is dependent on many factors outside of management s control 
therefore  we may not be able to generate consistent amounts of sales of recs in future periods 

table of contents in composite fibers  net sales for were million  an increase of million  or  from the improvement reflects strengthening demand in each of its product lines as volumes shipped increased 
on a constant currency basis  average selling prices were lower by million  and the translation of foreign currencies unfavorably affected net sales by approximately million 
composite fibers operating profit increased million  or  in the year over year comparison 
the improved performance was driven by the million combined benefit from improved demand in markets served resulting in higher shipments and the elimination of market driven downtime 
in addition  the production efficiencies from continuous improvement initiatives more than offset the adverse effect of foreign currency translation adjustments 
results for advanced airlaid materials are included from february   the date of the concert acquisition 
this business unit s results were unfavorably affected by rising input costs that outpaced the timing of increases in selling prices 
in addition  results were adversely impacted by operating inefficiencies and by million as a result of charging cost of products sold for the write up of acquired inventory to fair value 
alternative fuel mixture credits the us internal revenue code provided a tax credit for companies that use alternative fuel mixtures to produce energy to operate their businesses 
the credit  equal to per gallon of alternative fuel contained in the mixture  is refundable to the taxpayer 
on may   we were notified by the internal revenue service that our application to be registered as an alternative fuel mixer was approved 
during  we mixed and burned eligible alternative fuels  and earned million of alternative fuel mixture credits 
we record all alternative fuel mixture credits as a reduction to cost of goods sold 
according to the internal revenue code  the tax credit expired on december  pension expense the following table summarizes the amounts of pension expense recognized for compared to year ended december in thousands change recorded as costs of products sold sg a expense total the amount of pension expense recognized each year is determined using various actuarial assumptions and certain other factors  including discount rates and the fair value of our pension assets as of the beginning of the year 
the primary reason for the increase in pension expense in the comparison is due to decreases in discount rates used 
selling  general and administrative sg a sg a expenses increased million in the year to year comparison and totaled million for the increase was substantially all related to legal and professional fees related to the concert acquisition  costs to integrate the acquired entities and the inclusion of its operations prospectively from the date of acquisition

other nonoperating income expense for the year ended december   other non operating expense  net totaled million 
in connection with the concert acquisition  we entered into a series of forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the acquisition s canadian dollar purchase price 
all contracts were settled for cash during the first quarter of and resulted in a million loss  net of realized currency translation gains  which is presented under the caption other net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
in addition  in connection with purchase accounting for the concert transaction  we recorded a million reserve for tax risks  inclusive of accrued interest  existing at the time of the acquisition and at the same time recorded a million receivable from the seller due to an indemnification agreement 
during the fourth quarter  a tax ruling was issued that eliminated this tax risk and as a result we recognized an expense of million which is presented under the caption other net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income to eliminate the receivable from the seller 
we also recognized a million tax benefit for this same item to eliminate the tax reserve previously established resulting in no net impact to earnings during glatfelter annual report 
table of contents income taxes for  we recorded income tax benefits of million on million of pretax income 
the comparable amounts in the same period of were income tax expense of million on million of pretax income 
the benefit in was due to million of cellulosic biofuel credits  net  recorded as an income tax benefit in as discussed further below 
we also recorded the million tax benefit discussed in the previous paragraph  as well as a million adjustment to reduce tax liabilities resulting from the expiration of statutes on uncertain tax positions and other factors 
the tax provision in included a million benefit from nontaxable alternative fuel mixture credit 
cellulosic biofuel production credit in march  our application to be registered as a cellulosic biofuel producer was approved by the internal revenue service 
the us internal revenue code provides for a non refundable tax credit equal to per gallon for taxpayers that produce cellulosic biofuel 
on july   the irs office of chief counsel issued a memorandum which concluded that black liquor sold or used in a taxpayer s trade or business during calendar year  qualifies for the cellulosic biofuel producer credit cbpc 
accordingly  each gallon of black liquor we produced during calendar year qualifies for a non refundable cbpc of per gallon 
in connection with the filing of our income tax return  we claimed million  net of taxes  of cbpc 
subsequent to the end of  we received a cash tax refund of million  of which million related to alternative fuel mixture credits earned in the cbpc claimed is attributable to black liquor produced and burned from january  through february   after which we began mixing black liquor and diesel fuel to qualify for alternative fuel mixture credits 
in october  the irs issued further guidance concluding that both the alternative fuel mixture credit and the cellulosic biofuel production credit can be claimed in the same year  but only for different volumes of black liquor 
with respect to cbpc  although we do not intend to claim any additional credits  we could amend our federal tax return and claim additional credits 
if we were to elect to do so  we would be required to return cash already received from alternative fuel mixture credits  since we can only claim either the alternative fuel mixture credit or cbpc 
the ability to realize the value of any additional cbpc depends on future taxable income 
we continue to evaluate opportunities  if any  to claim additional cbpc from qualifying activities based on the results of our ongoing operations
