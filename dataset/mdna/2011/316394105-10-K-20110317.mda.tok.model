item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to our process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses 
the bank may be unable to maintain and service relationships with automobile dealers and the bank is subject to their willingness and ability to provide high quality indirect automobile loans 
the bank s indirect automobile lending operation depends in large part upon the ability to maintain and service relationships with automobile dealers  the strength of new and used automobile sales  the loan rate and other incentives offered by other purchasers of indirect automobile loans or by the automobile manufacturers and their captive finance companies  and the continuing ability of the 
table of contents consumer to qualify for and make payments on high quality automobile loans 
there can be no assurance the bank will be successful in maintaining such dealer relationships or increasing the number of dealers with which the bank does business  or that the existing dealer base will continue to generate a volume of finance contracts comparable to the volume historically generated by such dealers  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in the atlanta metropolitan area 
our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the atlanta metropolitan area and the specific local markets in which we operate 
unlike larger national or regional banks that are more geographically diversified  the bank provides banking and financial services to customers primarily in the atlanta metropolitan areas including fulton  dekalb  cobb  clayton  gwinnett  rockdale  coweta and barrow counties 
the local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans  the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources 
a significant decline in general economic conditions  caused by a significant economic slowdown  recession  inflation  acts of terrorism  outbreak of hostilities  or other international or domestic occurrences  unemployment  changes in securities markets  or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the earnings of financial services companies are significantly affected by general business and economic conditions 
our operations and profitability are impacted by general business and economic conditions in the united states and abroad 
these conditions include recession  short term and long term interest rates  inflation  money supply  political issues  legislative and regulatory changes  fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets  broad trends in industry and finance  and the strength of the us economy and the local economies in which we operate  all of which are beyond our control 
a deterioration in economic conditions could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and non performing assets  decreases in loan collateral values and a decrease in demand for our products and services  among other things  any of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future may have a significant adverse effect on our operations 
recent events in the financial services industry and  more generally  in the financial markets and the economy  have led to various proposals for changes in the regulation of the financial services industry 
the dodd frank act made a number of material changes in banking regulations 
the full impact of these changes remains to be seen 
however  fidelity anticipates that its compliance costs will increase as a result of the various new regulations required under the dodd frank act 
changes arising from implementation of dodd frank and any other new legislation may impact the profitability of our business activities  require we raise additional capital or change certain of our business practices  require us to divest certain business lines  materially affect our business model or affect retention of key personnel  and could expose us to additional costs  including increased compliance costs 
these changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes  and could therefore also adversely affect our business and operations 
further increases in fdic premiums could have a material adverse effect on our future earnings 
the fdic insures deposits at fdic insured financial institutions  including the bank 
the fdic charges the insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the deposit insurance fund at an adequate level 
in light of current economic conditions  the fdic has increased its assessment rates and imposed special assessments 
the fdic may further increase these rates and impose additional special assessments in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on future earnings 
there are substantial regulatory limitations on changes of control of bank holding companies 
with certain limited exceptions  federal regulations prohibit a person or company or a group of persons deemed to be acting in concert from  directly or indirectly  acquiring more than if the acquirer is a bank holding company of any class of our voting stock or obtaining the ability to control in any manner the election of a majority of our directors or otherwise direct the management or policies of our company without prior notice or application to and the approval of the federal reserve 
accordingly  prospective investors need to be aware of and comply with these requirements  if applicable  in connection with any purchase of shares of our common stock 
future dividend payments and common stock repurchases are restricted by the terms of the treasury s equity investment in us 
under the terms of the program  until the earlier of the third anniversary of the date of issuance of the preferred shares and the date on which the preferred shares have been redeemed in whole or the treasury has transferred all of the preferred shares to third parties  we are prohibited from increasing dividends on our common stock from the last quarterly cash dividend per share declared on the common stock prior to december   as adjusted for subsequent stock dividends and other similar actions  and from making certain repurchases of equity securities  including our common stock  without the treasury s consent 
furthermore  as 
table of contents long as the preferred shares are outstanding  dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions relating to certain equity securities  including our common stock  are prohibited until all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid on such preferred stock  subject to certain limited exceptions 
the limitations on executive compensation imposed through our participation in the capital purchase program may restrict our ability to attract  retain and motivate key employees  which could adversely affect our operations 
as part of our participation in the program  we agreed to be bound by certain executive compensation restrictions  including limitations on severance payments and the clawback of any bonus and incentive compensation that were based on materially inaccurate financial statements or any other materially inaccurate performance metric criteria 
subsequent to the issuance of the preferred shares  the arra was enacted  which provides more stringent limitations on severance pay and the payment of bonuses 
to the extent that any of these compensation restrictions do not permit us to provide a comprehensive compensation package to our key employees that is competitive in our market area  we may have difficulty in attracting  retaining and motivating our key employees  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
the terms governing the issuance of the preferred shares to the treasury may be changed  the effect of which may have an adverse effect on our operations 
the terms of the letter agreement which we entered into with the treasury provides that the treasury may unilaterally amend any provision of the letter agreement to the extent required to comply with any changes in applicable federal law that may occur in the future 
we have no assurances that changes in the terms of the transaction will not occur in the future 
such changes may place restrictions on our business or results of operations  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
liquidity is essential to our businesses and we rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of our operations 
liquidity is essential to our businesses 
our liquidity could be substantially affected in a negative fashion by an inability to raise funding in the debt capital markets or the equity capital markets or an inability to access the secured lending markets 
factors that we cannot control  such as disruption of the financial markets or negative views about the financial services industry generally  could impair our ability to raise funding 
in addition  our ability to raise funding could be impaired if lenders develop a negative perception of our financial prospects 
such negative perceptions could be developed if we suffer a decline in the level of our business activity or regulatory authorities take significant action against us  among other reasons 
if we are unable to raise funding using the methods described above  we would likely need to finance or liquidate unencumbered assets to meet maturing liabilities 
we may be unable to sell some of our assets  or we may have to sell assets at a discount from market value  either of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
fluctuations in interest rates could reduce our profitability and affect the value of our assets 
like other financial institutions  our earnings and cash flows are subject to interest rate risk 
our primary source of income is net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
we expect that we will periodically experience imbalances in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities and the relationships of various interest rates to each other 
over any defined period of time  our interest earning assets may be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest bearing liabilities  or vice versa 
in addition  the individual market interest rates underlying our loan and deposit products eg  prime versus competitive market deposit rates may not change to the same degree over a given time period 
in any event  if market interest rates should move contrary to our position  our earnings may be negatively affected 
also  the volume of nonperforming assets will negatively impact average yields if and as it increases 
in addition  loan volume and quality and deposit volume and mix can be affected by market interest rates 
changes in levels of market interest rates  including the current rate environment  could materially adversely affect our net interest spread  asset quality  origination volume and overall profitability 
in september  the federal reserve began lowering the targeted federal funds rate  reducing the rate to by the end of in  as the economic crisis deepened  the federal reserve continued to lower interest rates to a historic low of 
where it remained since 
while these short term market interest rates which we use as a guide to price our deposits decreased  the yield on our earning assets decreased more quickly which in combination with heavy competition for deposit accounts had a negative impact on our interest rate spread and net interest margin during and into income could also be adversely affected if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase quicker than the interest rates received on loans and other investments during periods of rising interest rates 
we principally manage interest rate risk by managing our volume and the mix of our earning assets and funding liabilities 
in a changing interest rate environment  we may not be able to manage this risk effectively 
if we are unable to manage interest rate risk effectively  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially harmed 

table of contents changes in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect our ability to originate construction  commercial and residential real estate loans  the value of our assets  and our ability to realize gains from the sale of our assets  all of which ultimately affect our earnings 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and market area 
we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors  many of which are larger and have more financial resources 
such competitors primarily include national  regional  and community banks within the markets in which we operate 
additionally  various out of state banks continue to enter the market area in which we currently operate 
we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions  including  without limitation  savings and loans  credit unions  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  and other financial intermediaries 
many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures 
additionally  due to their size  many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and  as a result  may offer a broader range of products and services  as well as better pricing for those products and services 
a weakening in our competitive position  could adversely affect our growth and profitability  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
financial services companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties 
in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions  we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties  including financial statements  credit reports  and other financial information 
we may also rely on representations of those customers  counterparties or other third parties  such as independent auditors  as to the accuracy and completeness of that information 
reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements  credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse impact on our business and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive governmental regulation 
we are subject to extensive supervision and regulation by federal and state governmental agencies  including the frb  the gdbf and the fdic 
current and future legislation  regulations  and government policy could adversely affect the company and the financial institution industry as a whole  including the cost of doing business 
although the impact of such legislation  regulations  and policies cannot be predicted  future changes may alter the structure of  and competitive relationships among  financial institutions and the cost of doing business  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our growth may require us to raise additional capital in the future  but that capital may not be available when it is needed 
we are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations 
we anticipate our capital resources will satisfy our capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
we may at some point  however  need to raise additional capital to support our growth 
if we raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other securities  it would dilute the ownership interest of our current shareholders and may dilute the per share book value of our common stock 
new investors may also have rights  preferences and privileges senior to our current shareholders  which may adversely impact our current shareholders 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside our control  and on our financial performance 
accordingly  we cannot assure that we will have the ability to raise additional capital  if needed  on terms acceptable to us 
if we cannot raise additional capital when needed  our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth or acquisitions could be materially impaired  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the building of market share through our branching strategy could cause our expenses to increase faster than revenues 
we intend to continue to build market share in the greater atlanta metropolitan area through our branching strategy 
while we have no commitments to branch during  there are branch locations under consideration and others may become available 
there are considerable costs involved in opening branches and new branches generally require a period of time to generate sufficient revenues to offset their costs  especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence 
accordingly  any new branch can be expected to negatively impact our earnings for some period of time until the branch reaches certain economies of scale 
our expenses could be further increased if we encounter delays in the opening of new branches 
finally  we have no assurance that new branches will be successful  even after they have been established 

table of contents potential acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value 
from time to time  we may evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions 
there is no assurance that any acquisitions will occur in the future 
however  if we do acquire other banks  businesses  or branches  such acquisitions would involve various risks  including the following potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company  exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company  difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company  potential disruption to our business  potential diversion of management s time and attention  the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company  difficulty in estimating the value of the target company  and potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company 
if we were to pay for acquisitions with shares of our common stock  some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur since acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values 
furthermore  failure to realize the expected benefits of an acquisition  such as anticipated revenue increases  cost savings  or increased geographic or product presence  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 
management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to attract and retain key people 
competition for the best people in most activities that we engage in can be intense and we may not be able to hire people or to retain them 
the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills  knowledge of our market  years of industry experience  and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel 
our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 
we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan  and other systems 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of our information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to claims and litigation 
from time to time  customers and others make claims and take legal action pertaining to the company s performance of our responsibilities 
whether customer claims and legal action related to the company s performance of our responsibilities are founded or unfounded  or if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to the company  they may result in significant financial liability and or adversely affect the market perception of the company and our products and services  as well as impact customer demand for those products and services 
any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on our business  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to our common stock our stock price can be volatile 
stock price volatility may make it more difficult for shareholders to resell common stock when they want and at prices they find attractive 
our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including  among other things 
table of contents news reports relating to trends  concerns and other issues in the financial services industry  actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations  recommendations by securities analysts  operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us  perceptions in the marketplace regarding the company and or our competitors  significant acquisitions or business combinations  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving the company or our competitors  changes in government laws and regulation  and geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts 
general market fluctuations  industry factors  and general economic and political conditions and events  such as economic slowdowns or recessions  interest rate changes or credit loss trends  could also cause our stock price to decrease  regardless of operating results 
our common stock trading volume is less than that of other larger financial services companies 
although our common stock is listed for trading on the nasdaq global select market  the trading volume in our common stock is less than that of larger financial services companies 
a public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth  liquidity  and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time 
this presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control 
given the lower trading volume of our common stock  significant sales of our common stock  or the expectation of these sales  could cause our stock price to fall 
the exercise of the warrant by the treasury would dilute existing shareholders ownership interest and may make it more difficult for us to take certain actions that may be in the best interest of shareholders 
in addition to the issuance of the preferred shares  we also granted to the treasury the warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
if the treasury exercises the entire warrant  it would result in a significant dilution to the ownership interest of our existing shareholders and dilute the earnings per share value of our common stock 
further  if the treasury exercises the entire warrant  it will become the second largest shareholder of fidelity 
the treasury has agreed that it will not exercise voting power with regard to the shares that it acquires by exercising the warrant 
however  treasury s abstention from voting may make it more difficult for us to obtain shareholder approval for those matters that require a majority of total shares outstanding  such as a business combination involving fidelity 
provisions in our bylaws and our tax benefits preservation plan may make it more difficult for another party to obtain control 
in november   the board of directors of the company adopted an amendment to the bylaws of the company electing for the provisions of article a of the georgia business corporation code the business combination statute to apply to the company and also adopted a tax benefits preservation plan 
the bylaw amendment and tax benefits preservation plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or could have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of us 
these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be at a price attractive to some of our shareholders

item legal proceedings we are a party to claims and lawsuits arising in the course of normal business activities

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consolidated financial review the following management discussion and analysis addresses important factors affecting the results of operations and financial condition of fsc and its subsidiaries for the periods indicated 
the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with this review 
overview our profitability  as with most financial institutions  is significantly dependent upon net interest income  which is the difference between interest received on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits and borrowings 
during a period of economic slowdown the lack of interest income from nonperforming assets and an additional provision for loan losses can greatly reduce our profitability 
results of operations are also affected by noninterest income  such as service charges on deposit accounts and fees on other services  income from indirect automobile and sba lending activities  mortgage banking  brokerage activities  and bank owned life insurance  as well as noninterest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits  occupancy  furniture and equipment  professional and other services  and other expenses  including income taxes 
economic conditions  competition  and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government significantly affect financial institutions 
poor performance of subprime loans initiated the credit crisis that began in the summer of  followed by substantial declines in residential home sales and prices  the slowing of the national economy and by a serious lack of liquidity 
by the end of  the credit turmoil migrated to consumer lending  as demonstrated by the increase in credit card delinquencies and automobile repossessions in all regions of the us  including our southeast markets 
in  the financial crisis worsened and led to a crisis of confidence in the financial sector as a result of concerns about the capital base and viability of certain financial institutions and the treasury had to step in with capital infusions for many financial institutions 
during this period  interbank lending and commercial paper borrowing fell sharply  precipitating a credit freeze for both institutional and individual borrowers 
in the second half of and continuing into  liquidity in the secondary markets began to improve 
the national unemployment rate  which increased as high as in  decreased to in december in  the federal reserve kept short term interest rates at historic lows in response to the continuing national economic downturn 
the recession had a major impact on the atlanta and florida economies  particularly in the residential construction and development markets 
many builders and building related businesses have suffered financially due to the decreasing home prices  lack of demand for houses and the oversupply of houses and residential lots 
in  we began to see some improvement in the real estate downturn as both delinquencies and foreclosures began to moderate 
these are the primary reasons that  when compared to  our net charge offs decreased to million during and our provision for loan losses decreased to million 
management recorded a total of million in provision for loan losses in  and compared to net charge offs of million over the same period  so for every dollar of net charge offs  we recorded in provision for loan losses 
our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans outstanding decreased to at december   from at the end of since our inception in  we have pursued managed profitable growth through internal expansion built on providing quality financial services 
during  as the economic crisis began to recede  the bank was able to grow its consumer installment  mortgage and commercial loan portfolios 
the loan portfolio is well diversified among consumer  business  and real estate 
net income for was million compared to net loss of million in net income per basic and diluted share was 
and  respectively for compared to a net loss per share of 
in key factors impacting our improved financial condition and results of operations for are summarized below the provision for loan losses for was million compared to million in net charge offs for were of average loans outstanding compared to for the allowance for loan losses was of outstanding loans and provided a coverage ratio of of nonperforming assets as of december  the net interest margin increased basis points in to from in  resulting from a basis point decrease in the cost of funds which was greater than the basis point decrease in the yield on earning assets 
management s successful efforts to reduce the cost of funds included aggressive reductions in interest rates within the constraints of our market as well as a shift in the deposit mix to emphasize lower cost savings accounts 
total assets increased million or to billion at the end of compared to billion at year end this increase was primarily due to an increase in loans as a result of growth in the consumer installment and commercial loan portfolios  a increase in loans held for sale primarily related to mortgage banking activities  and an increase in the investment portfolio somewhat offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents as liquid funds were converted to earning assets 

table of contents the bank s franchise spans eight counties in the metropolitan atlanta market and one branch office in jacksonville  florida 
our lending activities and the total of our nonperforming assets are significantly influenced by the local economic environments in atlanta and jacksonville 
our net interest margin is affected by prevailing interest rates  nonperforming assets and competition among financial institutions for loans and deposits 
atlanta s and to a lesser extent jacksonville s economies continue to be negatively impacted by the weak real estate market 
management expects the economy to be stable through the first half of with possible economic growth in the second half of the year 
the bank continues to attract new customer relationships  and talented and experienced bankers 
our overall focus is on building shareholder value 
our mission is to continue growth  improve earnings and increase shareholder value  to treat customers  employees  community and shareholders according to the golden rule  and to operate within a culture of strong internal controls 
the strong focus in will be on credit quality  expense controls  and quality loan growth 
critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and conform to general practices within the financial services industry 
our financial position and results of operations are affected by management s application of accounting policies  including estimates  assumptions  and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues  expenses  and related disclosures 
different assumptions in the application of these policies  or conditions significantly different from certain assumptions  could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 
our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
significant accounting policies have been periodically discussed and reviewed with and approved by the audit committee of the board of directors and the board of directors 
the following is a summary of our more critical significant accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established and maintained through provisions charged to operations 
such provisions are based on management s evaluation of the loan portfolio  including loan portfolio concentrations  current economic conditions  the economic outlook  past loan loss experience  adequacy of underlying collateral  and such other factors which  in management s judgment  deserve consideration in estimating loan losses 
loans are charged off when  in the opinion of management  such loans are deemed to be uncollectible 
subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance 
a formal review of the allowance for loan losses is prepared at least monthly to assess the probable credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio and to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
for purposes of the monthly management review  the loan portfolio is separated by loan type and each loan type is treated as a homogeneous pool 
in accordance with the interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses  the level of allowance required for each loan type is determined based upon historical charge off experience and current economic trends 
in addition to the homogenous pools of loans  every commercial  commercial real estate  sba  and construction loan is assigned a risk rating using established credit policy guidelines 
all nonperforming commercial  commercial real estate  sba  and construction loans and loans deemed to have greater than normal risk characteristics are reviewed monthly by credit review to determine the level of additional allowance for loan losses  if any  required to be specifically assigned to these loans 
capitalized servicing assets and liabilities we sell indirect automobile loan pools  residential mortgages and sba loans with servicing retained 
when the contractually specific servicing fees on loans sold servicing retained are expected to be more than adequate compensation to a servicer for performing the servicing  a capitalized servicing asset is recognized 
when the expected costs to a servicer for performing loan servicing are not expected to adequately compensate a servicer  a capitalized servicing liability is recognized 
servicing assets and servicing liabilities are amortized over the expected lives of the serviced loans utilizing the interest method 
management makes certain estimates and assumptions related to costs to service varying types of loans and pools of loans  the projected lives of loans and pools of loans sold servicing retained  and discount factors used in calculating the present values of servicing fees projected to be received 
no less frequently than quarterly  management reviews the status of all loans and pools of loans sold with related capitalized servicing assets to determine if there is any impairment to those assets due to such factors as earlier than estimated repayments or significant prepayments 
any impairment identified in these assets will result in reductions in their carrying values and a corresponding increase in operating expenses 

table of contents loan related revenue recognition loans are reported at principal amounts outstanding net of deferred fees and costs 
interest income and ancillary fees from loans are a primary source of revenue 
interest income is recognized in a manner that results in a level yield on principal amounts outstanding 
rate related loan fee income  loan origination  and commitment fees  and certain direct origination costs are deferred and amortized as an adjustment of the yield over the contractual lives of the related loans  taking into consideration assumed prepayments 
the accrual of interest is discontinued when  in management s judgment  it is determined that the collectability of interest or principal is doubtful 
for commercial  sba  construction  and real estate loans  the accrual of interest is discontinued and the loan categorized as nonaccrual when  in management s opinion  due to deterioration in the financial position or operations of the borrower  the full repayment of principal and interest is not expected  or principal or interest has been in default for a period of days or more  unless the obligation is both well secured and in the process of collection 
commercial  sba  construction  and real estate secured loans may be returned to accrual status when management expects to collect all principal and interest and the loan has been brought current 
interest received on well collateralized nonaccrual loans is recognized on the cash basis 
if the commercial  sba  construction or real estate secured loan is not well collateralized  payments are applied to reduce principal 
consumer loans are placed on nonaccrual upon becoming days past due or sooner if  in the opinion of management  the full repayment of principal and interest is not expected 
on consumer loans  any payment received on a loan on which the accrual of interest has been suspended is applied to reduce principal 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual  interest accrued during the current accounting period is reversed and interest accrued in prior periods  if significant  is charged off and adjustments to principal are made if the collateral related to the loan is deficient 
income taxes we file a consolidated federal income tax return  as well as tax returns in several states 
income taxes are accounted for in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  formerly known as sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under the liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled 
deferred tax assets are reviewed annually to assess the probability of realization of benefits in future periods or whether valuation allowances are appropriate 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
management has reviewed all evidence  both positive and negative  and concluded that a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset is not needed at december  the calculation of the income tax provision is complex and requires the use of judgments and estimates in its determination 
fair value the primary financial instruments that the company carries at fair value include investment securities  interest rate lock commitments irlcs  derivative instruments  and residential mortgage loans held for sale 
classification in the fair value hierarchy of financial instruments is based on the criteria set forth in fasb asc fair value is an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
the guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurements 
a financial instrument s level within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
investment securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair value utilizing level inputs 
for these securities  the company obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service 
the fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes  market spreads  cash flows  the us treasury yield curve  live trading levels  trade execution data  market consensus prepayment speeds  credit information and the bond s terms and conditions  among other things 
the investments in the company s portfolio are generally not quoted on an exchange but are actively traded in the secondary institutional markets 
the company classifies irlcs on residential mortgage loans  which are derivatives under sfas no 
now codified in asc  on a gross basis within other liabilities or other assets 
the fair value of these commitments  while based on interest rates observable in the market  is highly dependent on the ultimate closing of the loans 
these pull through rates are based on both the company s historical data and the current interest rate environment and reflect the company s best estimate of the likelihood that a commitment will ultimately result in a closed loan 
as a result of the adoption of sab no 
 the loan servicing value is also included in the fair value of irlcs 

table of contents derivative instruments are primarily transacted in the secondary mortgage and institutional dealer markets and priced with observable market assumptions at a mid market valuation point  with appropriate valuation adjustments for liquidity and credit risk 
for purposes of valuation adjustments to its derivative positions under fasb asc  the company has evaluated liquidity premiums that may be demanded by market participants  as well as the credit risk of its counterparties and its own credit 
the credit risk associated with the underlying cash flows of instruments carried at fair value was a consideration in estimating the fair value of certain financial instruments 
credit risk was considered in the valuation through a variety of inputs  as applicable  including  the actual default and loss severity of the collateral  and level of subordination 
the assumptions used to estimate credit risk applied relevant information that a market participant would likely use in valuing an instrument 
the fair value of residential mortgage loans held for sale is based on what secondary markets are currently offering for portfolios with similar characteristics 
as such  the company classifies these loans as level sba and indirect loans held for sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value 
fair value is based on recent trades for similar loan pools as well as offering prices for similar assets provided by buyers in the secondary market 
if the cost of a loan is determined to be less than the fair value of similar loans  the impairment is recorded by the establishment of a reserve to reduce the value of the loan 
impaired loans are evaluated and valued at the time the loan is identified as impaired  at the lower of cost or fair value 
fair value is measured based on the value of the collateral securing these loans and is classified as a level in the fair value hierarchy 
collateral may include real estate or business assets  including equipment  inventory and accounts receivable 
the value of real estate collateral is determined based on an appraisal by qualified licensed appraisers hired by the company 
if significant  the value of business equipment is based on an appraisal by qualified licensed appraisers hired by the company  otherwise  the equipment s net book value on the business financial statements is the basis for the value of business equipment 
inventory and accounts receivable collateral are valued based on independent field examiner review or aging reports 
appraised and reported values may be discounted based on management s historical knowledge  changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation  and management s expertise and knowledge of the client and client s business 
impaired loans are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly 
foreclosed assets are adjusted to fair value upon transfer of the loans to foreclosed assets 
subsequently  foreclosed assets are carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value less estimated selling costs 
fair value is based upon independent market prices  appraised values of the collateral or management s estimation of the value of the collateral 
when the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value  the company records the foreclosed asset as nonrecurring level when an appraised value is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value and there is no observable market price  the company records the foreclosed asset as nonrecurring level appraised and reported values may be discounted based on management s historical knowledge  changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation  and management s expertise and knowledge of the client and client s business

financial condition we manage our assets and liabilities to maximize long term earnings opportunities while maintaining the integrity of our financial position and the quality of earnings 
to accomplish this objective  management strives for efficient management of interest rate risk and liquidity needs 
the primary objectives of interest sensitivity management are to minimize the effect of interest rate changes on the net interest margin and to manage the exposure to risk while maintaining net interest income at acceptable levels 
liquidity is provided by our attempt to carefully structure our balance sheet and through unsecured and secured lines of credit with other financial institutions  the federal home loan bank of atlanta the fhlb  and the federal reserve bank of atlanta the frb 
the asset liability management committee alco meets regularly to  among other things  review our interest rate sensitivity positions and our balance sheet mix  monitor our capital position and ratios  review our product offerings and pricing  including rates  fees and charges  monitor our funding needs and sources  and review cash flows to assess our current and projected liquidity 
market risk our primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk  credit risk and liquidity risk 
we have little or no risk related to trading accounts  commodities  or foreign exchange 
interest rate risk  which encompasses price risk  is the exposure of a banking organization s financial condition and earnings ability to withstand adverse movements in interest rates 
accepting this risk can be an important source of profitability and shareholder value  however  excessive levels of interest rate risk can pose a significant threat to assets  earnings  and capital 
accordingly  effective risk management that maintains interest rate risk at prudent levels is essential to our success 
alco  which includes senior management representatives  monitors and considers methods of managing the rate and sensitivity repricing characteristics of the balance sheet components consistent with maintaining acceptable levels of changes in portfolio values and net interest income with changes in interest rates 
the primary purposes of alco are to manage our interest rate risk consistent with earnings and liquidity  to effectively invest our capital  and to preserve the value created by our core business operations 
our exposure to interest rate risk compared to established tolerances is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis by our board of directors 
evaluating a financial institution s exposure to changes in interest rates includes assessing both the adequacy of the management process used to control interest rate risk and the organization s quantitative levels of exposure 
when assessing the interest rate risk management process  we seek to ensure that appropriate policies  procedures  management information systems  and internal controls are in place to maintain interest rate risk at prudent levels with consistency and continuity 
evaluating the quantitative level of interest rate risk exposure requires us to assess the existing and potential future effects of changes in interest rates on our consolidated financial condition  including capital adequacy  earnings  liquidity  and  where appropriate  asset quality 

table of contents interest rate sensitivity analysis  referred to as equity at risk  is used to measure our interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in earnings and in the net present value of our cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet items in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
net present value represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities  with adjustments made for off balance sheet items 
this analysis assesses the risk of loss in market risk sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained   and basis point increases or decreases in market interest rates 
in addition  management reviews the impact of various yield curve scenarios on earnings and cash flows 
we utilize a statistical research firm specializing in the banking industry to provide various quarterly analyses and special analyses  as requested  related to our current and projected financial performance  including rate shock analyses 
data sources for this and other analyses include quarterly fdic call reports and the federal reserve y c  management assumptions  statistical loan portfolio information  industry norms and financial markets data 
for purposes of evaluating rate shock  rate change induced sensitivity tables are used in determining the timing and volume of repayment  prepayment  and early withdrawals 
earnings and fair value estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and  therefore  cannot be determined with precision 
assumptions have been made as to appropriate discount rates  prepayment speeds  expected cash flows  and other variables 
changes in assumptions significantly affect the estimates and  as such  the derived earnings and fair value may not be indicative of the negotiable value in an actual sale or comparable to that reported by other financial institutions 
in addition  the fair value estimates are based on existing financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business 
the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates 
our policy states that a negative change in net present value equity at risk as a result of an immediate and sustained basis point increase or decrease in interest rates should not exceed the lesser of of total assets or of total regulatory capital 
it also states that a similar increase or decrease in interest rates should not negatively impact net interest income or net income by more than or  respectively 
the following schedule reflects an analysis of our assumed market value risk and earnings risk inherent in our interest rate sensitive instruments related to immediate and sustained interest rate variances of basis points  both above and below current levels rate shock analysis 
it also reflects the estimated effects on net interest income and net income over a one year period and the estimated effects on net present value of our assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet items as a result of an immediate and sustained increase or decrease of basis points in market rates of interest as of december  and rate shock analysis december  december  market rates of interest basis points basis points basis points basis points dollars in thousands change in net present value change as a percent of total assets change as a percent of regulatory equity percent change in net interest income percent change in net income the rate shock analysis at december   indicated that the effects of an immediate and sustained increase of basis points in market rates of interest would fall within policy parameters and approved tolerances for equity at risk  net interest income and net income 
the effect of an immediate and sustained decrease of basis points in market rates would fall outside of policy parameters for net interest income and net income 
short term market rates have dropped to historically low levels so that an immediate and sustained decrease of basis points is highly doubtful 
rate shock analysis provides only a limited  point in time view of interest rate sensitivity 
the gap analysis also does not reflect factors such as the magnitude versus the timing of future interest rate changes and asset prepayments 
the actual impact of interest rate changes upon earnings and net present value may differ from that implied by any static rate shock or gap measurement 
in addition  net interest income and net present value under various future interest rate scenarios are affected by multiple other factors not embodied in a static rate shock or gap analysis  including competition  changes in the shape of the treasury yield curve  divergent movement among various interest rate indices  and the speed with which interest rates change 

table of contents interest rate sensitivity the major elements used to manage interest rate risk include the mix of fixed and variable rate assets and liabilities and the maturity and repricing patterns of these assets and liabilities 
it is our policy not to invest in derivatives outside of our mortgage hedging process 
we perform a quarterly review of assets and liabilities that reprice and the time bands within which the repricing occurs 
balances generally are reported in the time band that corresponds to the instrument s next repricing date or contractual maturity  whichever occurs first 
however  fixed rate indirect automobile loans  mortgage backed securities  and residential mortgage loans are primarily included based on scheduled payments with a prepayment factor incorporated 
through such analyses  we monitor and manage our interest sensitivity gap to minimize the negative effects of changing interest rates 
the interest rate sensitivity structure within our balance sheet at december   indicated a cumulative net interest sensitivity asset gap of when projecting forward six months 
when projecting out one year  there was a net interest sensitivity asset gap of 
this information represents a general indication of repricing characteristics over time  however  the sensitivity of certain deposit products may vary during extreme swings in the interest rate cycle see market risk 
since all interest rates and yields do not adjust at the same velocity  the interest rate sensitivity gap is only a general indicator of the potential effects of interest rate changes on net interest income 
our policy states that the cumulative gap at six months and one year should generally not exceed and  respectively 
our cumulative gap at six months and one year both fall within this guideline 
the following table illustrates our interest rate sensitivity at december   as well as the cumulative position at december  all amounts are categorized by their actual maturity or repricing date with the exception of non maturity deposit accounts 
as a result of prior experience during periods of rate volatility and management s estimate of future rate sensitivities  we allocate the non maturity deposit accounts noted below  based on the estimated duration of those deposits interest rate sensitivity analysis repricing within over one days days days days days days days year total dollars in thousands interest earning assets investment securities loans loans held for sale federal funds sold due from banks interest earning total interest earning assets cumulative rsa interest bearing liabilities demand deposit accounts savings and now accounts money market accounts time deposits  time deposits  incl bd long term debt short term borrowings total interest bearing liabilities cumulative rsl interest sensitivity gap cumulative ratio of cumulative gap to total interest earning assets ratio of interest sensitive assets to interest sensitive liabilities liquidity liquidity is defined as the ability to meet anticipated customer demands for funds under credit commitments and deposit withdrawals at a reasonable cost and on a timely basis 
management measures the liquidity position by giving consideration to both on balance sheet and off balance sheet sources of and demands for funds on a daily and weekly basis 

table of contents management seeks to maintain a stable net liquidity position while optimizing operating results  as reflected in net interest income  the net yield on earning assets  and the cost of interest bearing liabilities in particular 
alco meets regularly to review the current and projected net liquidity positions and to review actions taken by management to achieve this liquidity objective 
while the desired level of liquidity will vary depending on a number of factors  it is the primary goal of fidelity to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity in both normal operating conditions and in periods of market or industry stress 
levels of total liquidity  short term liquidity  and short term liquidity sources will be important in based on projected core loan growth and projected sba and indirect automobile loan production and sales 
sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  net of federal requirements to maintain reserves against deposit liabilities  investment securities eligible for sale or pledging to secure borrowings from dealers and customers pursuant to securities sold under agreements to repurchase repurchase agreements  loan repayments  loan sales  deposits and certain interest sensitive deposits  brokered deposits  a collateralized contingent line of credit at the frb discount window  a collateralized line of credit from the fhlb  and  borrowings under unsecured overnight federal funds lines available from correspondent banks 
the principal demands for liquidity are new loans  anticipated fundings under credit commitments to customers  and deposit withdrawals 
the company has limited liquidity  and it relies primarily on interest and dividends from subsidiaries equity  subordinated debt  and trust preferred securities  interest income  management fees  and dividends from the bank as sources of liquidity 
interest and dividends from subsidiaries ordinarily provide a source of liquidity to a bank holding company 
the bank pays interest to fidelity on the bank s subordinated debt and its short term investments in the bank and cash dividends on its preferred stock and common stock 
under the regulations of the gdbf  bank dividends may not exceed of the prior year s net earnings without approval from the gdbf 
if dividends received from the bank were reduced or eliminated  our liquidity would be adversely affected 
the bank s net liquid asset ratio  defined as federal funds sold  investments maturing in days  unpledged securities  available unsecured federal funds lines of credit  fhlb borrowing capacity and available brokered certificates of deposit divided by total assets decreased from at december  to at december  the decrease is due to lower federal funds sold as management has been able to deploy excess liquidity into the loan portfolio

net cash flows used in investing activities were negatively impacted by million of cash outflows for purchases of investment securities available for sale and million related to the increase in the loan portfolio 
in addition  the net cash flows used in investing activities were positively impacted by net cash inflows from maturities and calls of investment securities of million  and proceeds from the sale of investment securities available for sale of million

contractual obligations and other commitments the following schedule provides a summary of our financial commitments to make future payments  primarily to fund loan and other credit obligations  long term debt  and rental commitments primarily for the lease of branch facilities  the operations center  the sba lending office  and the commercial lending  construction lending  and executive offices as of december  payments for borrowings do not include interest 
payments related to leases are based on actual payments specified in the underlying contracts 
loan commitments  lines of credit  and letters of credit are presented at contractual amounts  however  since many of these commitments are revolving commitments as discussed below and many are expected to expire unused or partially used  the total amount of these commitments does not necessarily reflect future cash requirements 

table of contents commitment maturity or payment due by period commitments more than years or or long term year or year but less more but less years or borrowings less than years than years more in thousands home equity lines construction acquisition and development commercial sba mortgage letters of credit lines of credit total financial commitments subordinated debt long term borrowings rental commitments purchase obligations total commitments and long term borrowings financial commitments include both secured and unsecured obligations to fund 
certain residential construction and acquisition and development commitments relate to revolving commitments whereby payments are received as individual homes or parcels are sold  therefore  the outstanding balances at any one time will be less than the total commitment 
construction loan commitments in excess of one year have provisions to convert to term loans at the end of the construction period 
subordinated debt is comprised of five trust preferred security issuances 
we have no obligations related to the trust preferred security holders other than to remit periodic interest payments and to remit principal and interest due at maturity 
each trust preferred security provides us the opportunity to prepay the securities at specified dates from inception  the fixed rate issues with declining premiums based on the time outstanding or at par after designated periods for all issues 
all long term borrowings are collateralized with investment grade securities or with pledged real estate loans 
leases and other rental agreements typically have renewal options either at predetermined rates or market rates on renewal 
purchase obligations include significant contractual obligations under legally enforceable contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable with initial terms greater than one year 
the majority of these amounts are primarily for services  including core processing systems and telecommunications maintenance 
off balance sheet arrangements we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers  and to reduce our own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
these financial instruments  which include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit  involve to varying degrees elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
the contract or notional amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of involvement we have in particular classes of financial instruments 
our exposure to credit loss  in the event of nonperformance by customers for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit  is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments 
we use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for recorded loans 
loan commitments and other off balance sheet exposures are evaluated by the credit review department quarterly and reserves are provided for risk as deemed appropriate 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the agreement 
substantially all of our commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding 
we minimize our exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures 
thus  we will deny funding a commitment if the borrower s financial condition deteriorates during the commitment period  such that the customer no longer meets the pre established conditions of lending 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
we evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower 
collateral held varies  but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  and income producing commercial properties 
standby and import letters of credit are commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans or lines of credit to customers 
we hold collateral supporting those commitments as deemed necessary 
loans during  total loans outstanding  which included loans held for sale  increased million or to billion when compared to the bank s total loan production increased to billion in compared to billion in the increase in loans was the result of a million or increase in consumer installment loans  consisting primarily of indirect automobile loans  to million because of the improving economy in the bank s market area

contributing to the decline were continued construction loan charge offs  foreclosures and payoffs  which more than offset loan production 
loans held for sale increased million or to million primarily due to a million increase in mortgage loans held for sale to million due to the expansion of the bank s mortgage lending division 
the balance of the increase in loans held for sale was in sba loans which increased million to million

we manage and control risk in the loan portfolio through adherence to standards established by the board of directors and senior management  combined with a commitment to producing quality assets  monitoring loan performance  developing profitable relationships  and meeting the strategic loan quality and growth targets 
our credit policies establish underwriting standards  place limits on exposures  which include concentrations and commitments  and set other limits or standards as deemed necessary and prudent 
also included in the policy  primarily determined by the amount and type of loan  are various approval levels  ranging from the branch or department level to those that are more centralized 
we maintain a diversified portfolio intended to spread risk and reduce exposure to economic downturns  which may occur in different segments of the economy or in particular industries 
industry and loan type diversification is reviewed at least quarterly 
management has taken numerous steps to reduce credit risk in the loan portfolio and to strengthen the credit risk management team and processes 
a special assets group was organized in to evaluate potential nonperforming loans  to properly value nonperforming assets  and to facilitate the timely disposition of these assets while minimizing losses to the company 
in addition  all credit policies have been reviewed and revised as necessary  and experienced managers are in place and have strengthened all lending areas and credit administration 
because of moderating asset quality trends  particularly in our consumer indirect lending portfolio  and a reduction in the level of average nonperforming assets  the provision for loan losses for the year ended december   decreased to million compared to a million for the year ended december  net charge offs in decreased to million compared to million during  largely due to a decrease in real estate construction and indirect lending charge offs 
this decrease is a function of the stabilizing housing market and to improvements in the economy in general and its impact on consumers 
the decrease in loan loss provision is a result of a reduction in average nonperforming assets which peaked in the first quarter of at an average of million and was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  construction loan net charge offs decreased from million for the year ended december  to million in the performance of the consumer indirect lending portfolio of loans which at december   made up of the total loan portfolio  has also shown improvement in indirect loans days delinquent decreased from december  to december  nonaccrual indirect loan balances decreased from december  to december  management recorded a total of million in combined provision for loan losses for the three year period ended december  compared to net charge offs of million over the same period  so for every dollar of net charge offs  we recorded in provision for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was as of the end of compared to at the end of the credit review department credit review regularly reports to senior management and the loan and discount committee of the board regarding the credit quality of the loan portfolio  as well as trends in the portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
credit review monitors loan concentrations  production  loan growth  as well as loan quality  and independent from the lending departments  reviews risk ratings and tests credits approved for adherence to our lending standards 
finally  credit review also performs ongoing  independent reviews of the risk management process and adequacy of loan documentation 
the results of its reviews are reported to the loan and discount committee of the board 
the consumer collection function is centralized and automated to ensure timely collection of accounts and consistent management of risks associated with delinquent accounts 

table of contents nonperforming assets nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans  troubled debt restructured loans  if any  repossessions  and other real estate 
nonaccrual loans are loans on which the interest accruals have been discontinued when it appears that future collection of principal or interest according to the contractual terms may be doubtful 
troubled debt restructured loans are those loans whose terms have been modified  because of economic or legal reasons related to the debtors financial difficulties  to provide for a reduction in principal  change in terms  or modification of interest rates to below market levels 
the bank had million in troubled debt restructured loans at december   of which million were accruing loans and million are on nonaccrual and included in nonperforming assets below 
repossessions include vehicles and other personal property that have been repossessed as a result of payment defaults on indirect automobile loans and commercial loans 
nonperforming assets december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans repossessions other real estate total nonperforming assets loans past due days or more and still accruing ratio of loans past due days or more and still accruing to total loans ratio of nonperforming assets to total loans  repossessions and ore the increase in nonperforming assets from december   to december   was a result of an increase in nonaccrual loans 
management believes it has been proactive in charging down and charging off these nonperforming assets as appropriate 
management s assessment of the overall loan portfolio is that loan quality and performance have stabilized 
management is being aggressive in evaluating credit relationships and proactive in addressing problems 
when a loan is classified as nonaccrual  to the extent collection is in question  previously accrued interest is reversed and interest income is reduced by the interest accrued in the current year 
if any portion of the accrued interest was accrued in a previous period  accrued interest is reduced and a charge for that amount is made to the allowance for loan losses 
for  the gross amount of interest income that would have been recorded on nonaccrual loans  if all such loans had been accruing interest at the original contract rate  was approximately million compared to million and million during and  respectively 
for additional information on nonaccrual loans see critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses 
allowance for loan losses as discussed in critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses  the allowance for loan losses is established and maintained through provisions charged to operations 
such provisions are based on management s evaluation of the loan portfolio including current economic conditions  loan portfolio concentrations  the economic outlook  past loan loss experience  adequacy of underlying collateral  and such other factors which  in management s judgment  deserve consideration in estimating loan losses 
loans are charged off when  in the opinion of management  such loans are deemed to be uncollectible 
subsequently  recoveries are added to the allowance 
for all loan categories  historical loan loss experience  adjusted for changes in the risk characteristics of each loan category  current trends  and other factors  is used to determine the level of allowance required 
additional amounts are allocated based on the possible losses of individual impaired loans and the effect of economic conditions on both individual loans and loan categories 
since the allocation is based on estimates and subjective judgment  it is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts of losses that may ultimately occur 
in determining the allocated allowance  all portfolios are treated as homogenous pools 
the allowance for loan losses for the homogenous pools is allocated to loan types based on historical net charge off rates adjusted for any current changes in these trends 
within the commercial  commercial real estate  and business banking portfolios  every nonperforming loan and loans having greater than normal risk characteristics are not treated as homogenous pools and are individually reviewed for a specific allocation 
the specific allowance for these individually reviewed loans is based on a specific loan impairment analysis 
in determining the appropriate level for the allowance  management ensures that the overall allowance appropriately reflects a margin for the imprecision inherent in most estimates of the range of probable credit losses 
this additional allowance  if any  is reflected in the unallocated portion of the allowance

the allowance allocated to real estate mortgage loans increased to million at december  compared to million at december  the increase is primarily a result of higher specific loan loss reserves at december  compared to december  the allowance allocated to commercial real estate loans increased  during to million compared to million at the end of the increase is primarily related to an increase in specific loss reserves

investment securities other than the investment in fhlb stock  on an amortized cost basis totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase of million in investments at december   compared to december   was attributable to management s decision to better position the portfolio for future changes in interest rates and execute cash flow and capital risk rating strategies

as interest rates stabilized at historically low levels in  many customers fearing locking in low certificate of deposit rates  put their money into money market accounts which pay competitive rates but allow the depositor the flexibility to access the funds when necessary 
management encouraged this behavior by offering promotional interest rates to help manage the duration of the bank s deposit liabilities and projected liquidity 
these promotional rates on money market accounts typically provide a higher interest rate for the first days before reverting to the normal rate 
the increase in noninterest bearing demand deposits was in part due to an increase in the number of transaction accounts as the result of continued benefits from the transaction account acquisition initiative continued in  and in part due to unlimited deposit insurance coverage available through december   for noninterest bearing transaction accounts through implementation of the dodd frank act
