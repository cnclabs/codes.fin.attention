we continue to monitor raw material prices closely and implement sales price increases where possible  but the volatility of the cost of these raw materials remains uncertain 
revenues from our industrial materials segment exceeded prior year results due to increased sales from our wire cable and electronic coatings product lines 
we completed our plant move from webster  ma to oxford  ma ahead of schedule this past year  and recently announced the next phase of our consolidation plan  closing the randolph  ma facility over the next twelve to fifteen months 
additionally  in the first half of fiscal  we will be transitioning our humiseal europe ltd manufacturing operations from camberley  uk to a modern facility in winnersh  uk 
revenues from our construction materials segment were below prior year results due to poor market conditions in the construction and building sectors  which had a direct impact on sales of our private label products 
this segment was also impacted this past year by some production issues at our rye  uk facility primarily due to challenges in meeting heavy middle east demand for pipeline products 
these issues were rectified by process improvements implemented in the fourth quarter  but they resulted in higher costs and decreased production from 
table of contents that facility 
we will continue to monitor our production processes to ensure that we deliver high quality goods to meet market needs as they arise 
in the upcoming fiscal year  our key objectives will include continuous efficiency improvements  long term consolidation and investment in r d and marketing as this long term commitment is expected to pay off in new products and increased business in future years 
our balance sheet continues to remain strong  with cash on hand of million and a current ratio of although the current economic climate remains uncertain  we remain focused on our long term strategic goals 
the balance of our unsecured term debt is currently million 
this term debt was used to finance our acquisitions in fiscal our million line of credit is fully available 
the company has two reportable segments summarized below segment product lines manufacturing focus and products industrial materials wire and cable electronic coatings custom products protective coatings and tape products including insulating and conducting materials for wire and cable manufacturers  moisture protective coatings for electronics and printing services  laminated durable papers  and flexible composites and laminates for the aerospace  packaging and industrial laminate markets 
construction materials pipeline construction products private label protective coatings and tape products including coating and lining systems for use in liquid storage and containment applications  protective coatings for pipeline and general construction applications  high performance polymeric asphalt additives  and expansion and control joint systems for use in the transportation and architectural markets 
as further detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  the electronic manufacturing services business was sold in june and the financial results of this previously reported segment are classified as discontinued operations 
we have reflected the results of this business as discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations for all periods presented 

table of contents results of operations revenues and operating profit by segment are as follows revenues income from continuing operations before income taxes of revenues dollars in thousands fiscal industrial materials   a construction materials less corporate and common costs income from continuing operations before income taxes fiscal industrial materials   b construction materials less corporate and common costs income from continuing operations before income taxes fiscal industrial materials   c construction materials less corporate and common costs  d income from continuing operations before income taxes a includes idle facility costs of from our paterson  nj and oxford  ma facilities b includes idle facility costs of from our paterson  nj and oxford  ma facilities c includes loss on impairment of goodwill of d includes loss on impairment of assets of total revenues total revenues in fiscal increased  or to  from  in the prior year 
revenues in our industrial materials segment increased  or to  for the year ended august  compared to  in fiscal the increase in revenues from our industrial materials segment in fiscal was primarily due to increased sales of a  from our wire cable product line as we benefitted from increased demand in the electrical cable market  b  in the electronic coatings product line  primarily due to increased demand in the industrial controls and automotive markets  and c  from our custom products product lines 
revenues from our construction materials segment decreased  or to  for the year ended august  compared to  for fiscal the reduced sales from our construction materials segment in fiscal was primarily due to decreased sales of a  from our private label products due to less demand for these products  b  from pipeline products produced at our uk facility as we experienced production challenges in meeting heavy middle east demand in the latter half of fiscal  and c  from our construction product lines as a result of decreased demand in the transportation and architectural markets 
royalties and commissions in the industrial materials segment were   and  for the years ended august   and  respectively 
the increase in royalties and 
table of contents commissions in fiscal over the prior two fiscal years was due to increased sales of electronic coatings by our licensed manufacturer in asia 
export sales from domestic operations to unaffiliated third parties were   and  for the years ended august   and  respectively 
the growth in our export sales in fiscal was primarily due to increased demand from our foreign customers in the aerospace and wire cable markets 
total revenues in fiscal increased  or to  from  in fiscal revenues in our industrial materials segment increased  or to  for the year ended august  compared to  in fiscal the increase in revenues from our industrial materials segment in fiscal was primarily due to increased sales of  in the electronic coatings product line from both the worldwide automotive sector and protective products used in domestic infrastructure applications 
this increase was partially offset by decreased sales of  from our custom products product lines primarily due to decreased demand in the transportation market 
revenues from our construction materials segment increased  or to  for the year ended august  compared to  for fiscal the increase in revenues from our construction materials segment in fiscal was primarily due to increased sales of a  from cim which we acquired in september  b  from serviwrap which was acquired in december  c  from our pipeline and construction product lines  and d  from our private label products due to increased demand for these products 
cost of products and services sold cost of products and services sold increased  or to  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to  in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  cost of products and services sold increased to in fiscal compared to for fiscal the following table summarizes the relative percentages of costs of products and services sold to revenues for both of our reporting segments fiscal years ended august  cost of products and services sold industrial materials construction materials total cost of products and services sold in our industrial materials segment was  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to  in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  cost of products and services sold in the industrial materials segment increased primarily due to rising prices in certain commodity and petroleum based raw materials impacting many of our product lines throughout the year 
additionally  we incurred incremental one time expenses in the latter half of fiscal related to the transition of our webster  ma production processes over to the oxford  ma facility 
while we continue to face challenges with margin pressures across many of our key product lines  we anticipate a favorable future impact as a result of this transition 
cost of products and services sold in our construction materials segment was  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to  in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  cost of products and services sold in the construction materials segment increased primarily due to higher raw material costs which were partially offset by increased sales of our higher margin products and the resulting lower share of total sales that were made up of lower margin products 
in fiscal  cost of products and services sold increased  or to  compared to  in the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of products and services sold decreased to in fiscal compared to for fiscal cost of products and services sold in our industrial materials segment were  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to  in fiscal the percentage of revenues decrease in the cost of products and services sold for the industrial materials segment was primarily due to increased sales of higher margin products  management ability to leverage its fixed overhead costs on a higher revenue base  and the favorable impact of ongoing cost reduction efforts 
cost 
table of contents of products and services sold in our construction materials segment were  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to  in fiscal the large dollar value increase in cost of products and services sold in this construction materials segment during fiscal was primarily attributable to the fiscal acquisitions of the cim business and the serviwrap product lines 
the decrease in cost of products and services sold as a percentage of revenues in this segment during fiscal was a direct result of a favorable product mix coupled with continued focus and scrutiny on material purchases that helped stabilize margins on many of our key product lines 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  or to  during fiscal compared to  in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal compared to for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to acquisition costs of  incurred in fiscal and lower stock based compensation expense in fiscal these were partially offset by increased research and development  sales commissions and other selling related expenses resulting from increased revenues in the current year 
during fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or to  compared to  in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses remained flat at in both fiscal and the dollar increase in fiscal was primarily attributable to incremental expenses from the cim and serviwrap acquisitions  including acquisition costs of  and amortization of intangible assets of  additionally  increased revenues and profitability in fiscal compared to the prior year led to increased sales commissions and other selling related expenses and increased incentive compensation expense 
these increases were partially offset by management continued emphasis on controlling costs  including reduced travel and external consulting costs 
in fiscal  bad debt expense  net of recoveries  decreased  or to  compared to  in fiscal the improvement in fiscal was a result of our strict adherence to our established credit policies as well as closely monitoring the accounts receivable function and taking a proactive approach to the collections process 
bad debt expense  net of recoveries  increased  to  in fiscal compared to a net gain of  in fiscal that was due to recoveries of previously identified bad debt that exceeded additions to bad debt expense for the fiscal year 
the increase in bad debt expense in fiscal was primarily due to financial difficulties for several of our customers as well as overall increased receivable balances due to higher sales 
loss on impairment of fixed assets in fiscal  we recorded a  charge related to the impairment of real property land and building located in west bridgewater  ma which was being leased to sunburst electronics manufacturing solutions  inc the real property  having a pre impairment book value of  was written down to its fair value of  which was realized upon the june sale of the property 
loss on impairment of goodwill in fiscal  based on the decrease in sales activity in the fiscal year and the completion of the fiscal budget  we determined that the carrying value of goodwill associated with our northeast quality products neqp division may not be recoverable 
accordingly  we performed a goodwill impairment analysis 
based on the present value of future cash flows utilizing projected results for the balance of fiscal year and projections for future years based on the fiscal year budgeting process  the goodwill impairment analysis yielded results that did not support the current book value of the goodwill associated with this division 
as a result  we concluded that the carrying amount of goodwill for the neqp division was not fully recoverable and an impairment charge of  was recorded as of may  goodwill related to neqp  having a pre impairment book value of  was written down to its fair value of  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the neqp division was sold on august   and the adjusted fair value of  was realized upon the sale 
interest expense interest expense decreased  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the decrease in interest expense in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year is primarily due to the capitalization of 
table of contents imputed interest on construction in process projects related to our oxford  ma and pittsburgh  pa facilities 
interest expense increased  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the increase in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal is a direct result of the  term note and  promissory notes related to the acquisition of cim  and the  term loan related to the acquisition of serviwrap 
other income other income increased  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal other income primarily includes interest income and foreign exchange gains caused by changes in exchange rates on transactions or balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries 
the increase in other income in fiscal from the prior year is primarily due to foreign exchange gains losses caused by the volatility of the pound sterling and the euro  and the subsequent revaluation of some of our european sales transactions completed in other functional currencies and subsequently translated to the pound sterling and the euro 
other income decreased  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the decrease in other income in fiscal from the prior year is primarily due to the fiscal inclusion of rental income that we received from real property sold in june income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
in all three years  we have received the benefit of the domestic production deduction and foreign rate differential 
the effective tax rate of for fiscal compares favorably to due to an increase in the applicable domestic production deduction for the year to increased from in fiscal and a more favorable effective state income tax rate in the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to a less favorable foreign tax rate differential and research credit in fiscal as compared to fiscal net income consolidated net income in fiscal decreased  or to  compared to  in fiscal income from continuing operations increased  or to  for the year ended august  compared to  in fiscal the increase in net income from continuing operations in fiscal was a result of increased revenues offset by increased raw material costs

income from discontinued operations increased  or to  for the year ended august  compared to  in fiscal the increase in income from discontinued operations in fiscal was primarily a result of the  gain on the sale of the chase ems business as well as the overall growth in sales in fiscal liquidity and sources of capital our overall cash balance decreased  to  at august  from  at august  the decreased cash balance at august  was a result of cash on hand used for strategic purchases of key raw materials  payment of our annual dividend in december  debt repayments and purchases of machinery and equipment including improvements made to our oxford  ma facility 
these cash outflows were partially offset by cash generated from operations during the year 
our overall cash balance increased  to  at august  from  at august  the increased cash balance at august  was a result of the june sale of our electronic manufacturing services business as well as cash flows generated from operations during the year  offset by cash used for acquisitions 
cash flow provided by operations was  for the year ended august  compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal cash provided by operations during fiscal  was 
table of contents primarily due to operating income offset by increased purchases of inventory  as we strategically built up our inventory to facilitate certain manufacturing plant transition plans as well as making bulk purchases of key raw materials to take advantage of favorable pricing terms 
cash provided by operations during fiscal was primarily due to operating income and decreased accounts payable and accrued expense balances  offset by increased accounts receivable and inventory balances 
cash provided by operations during fiscal was primarily due to operating income and decreased accounts receivable and inventory balances  offset by reduced accounts payable balances 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was as of august  compared to as of august  the increase in our current ratio at august  was primarily attributable to the increases in our raw material and finished goods inventories as well as a decrease in our accrued income taxes  which were partially offset by an overall decrease in our cash balance as noted above 
cash flow used in investing activities was  for the year ended august  compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal during fiscal  cash flow used in investing activities was primarily due to  paid for machinery and equipment and improvements made for our oxford  ma facility   paid for machinery and equipment and improvements made for our facility in o hara township  pa   paid related to the build out of our newly leased property in winnersh  uk  and cash paid for purchases of machinery and equipment at our other manufacturing locations 
these cash outflows were partially offset by additional proceeds during fiscal of  received from the sale of our chase ems business 
during fiscal  cash flow used in investing activities was primarily due to payments totaling  for the acquisitions of cim and serviwrap  and  paid for purchases of machinery and equipment at our other manufacturing locations during fiscal this was partially offset by the  of net proceeds received from the sale of our discontinued operations 
during fiscal  cash flow used in investing activities was primarily due to  used to pay for the purchase of real property in oxford  ma   paid for purchases related to the build out of our manufacturing facility in pittsburgh  pa  and purchases of machinery and equipment at our other manufacturing locations 
cash flow used in financing activities was  for the year ended august  as compared to cash flow provided by financing activities of  in fiscal and cash flow used in financing activities of  in fiscal during fiscal  cash flow used in financing activities reflected our annual dividend payment and payments made on the bank loans we used to finance our prior year acquisitions of cim and serviwrap 
additionally  we paid the first of three scheduled promissory note payments of  to the cim shareholders in accordance with the cim stock purchase agreement  described in more detail below 
during fiscal  cash flow provided by financing activities primarily resulted from a total of  in term debt used to finance our acquisitions of cim and serviwrap 
these were partially offset by payments made on the acquisition loans and our line of credit arrangement  as well as our annual dividend 
during fiscal  cash flow used in financing activities reflected the payment of the annual dividend and payments of statutory minimum taxes on restricted stock 
on october   we announced a cash dividend of per share totaling  comprised of related to earnings from continuing operations and related to earnings from discontinued operations  to shareholders of record on october  and paid on december  on october   we announced a cash dividend of per share totaling approximately  to shareholders of record on october  and payable on december  we continue to have long term unsecured credit available up to  with bank of america at the bank base lending rate or  at the option of the company  at the effective london interbank offered rate libor plus basis points 
on june   we executed an amendment to this credit facility  extending its maturity to march  as part of this amendment  the interest rate was increased by basis points  from its original rate of libor plus basis points 
all other terms of the credit facility remain the same 
as of august  and october   the entire amount of  was available for use 
we plan to use this availability to help finance our cash needs  including potential acquisitions  in fiscal and future periods 
under the terms of our credit facility  we must comply with certain debt covenants related to a the ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth and b the ratio of operating cash flow to debt service on a rolling twelve month basis 
we were in compliance with our debt covenants as of august  
table of contents we borrowed  from bank of america in september in order to fund our acquisition of cim 
this borrowing involved an unsecured  three year term note the term note with interest and principal payments due monthly 
interest is calculated at the applicable libor rate plus a margin of basis points  with interest payments due on the last day of each month 
at august   the applicable interest rate was per annum and the outstanding principal amount was  in addition to monthly interest payments  we are repaying the principal in equal installments of  per month  beginning on september   and on the last day of each month thereafter  ending on august   when we will repay the remaining principal balance plus any interest then due 
the term note is subject to the same debt covenants as our line of credit discussed above 
prepayment of the term note is allowed at any time during the term of the loan 
in november  we executed an amendment to this term note  extending the maturity to august  monthly payments of  will continue through august  at which time we will repay the remaining principal balance plus any interest then due 
all other terms of the term note remain the same 
as part of the cim acquisition in september  we also delivered  in non negotiable promissory notes the notes payable to five cim shareholders  who were the holders of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of cim as of the acquisition date 
the principal of the notes will be paid in three consecutive annual installments of  each  with the initial payment due on september  interest on the unpaid principal balance of the notes is accruing at a rate per annum equal to the applicable federal rate  and will be paid annually with each principal payment 
at august   the applicable interest rate was per annum 
we paid the first installment on the notes in september and the second installment was paid in september in december  we borrowed  from rbs citizens in order to fund our acquisition of the serviwrap product lines 
this borrowing involved an unsecured  three year term note the term loan with interest and principal payments due monthly 
interest is calculated at the applicable libor rate plus a margin of basis points  with interest payments due on the last day of each month 
in addition to monthly interest payments  we are repaying the principal in equal installments of  each  beginning on january   and on the th day of each month thereafter  ending on december   when we will repay the remaining principal balance plus any interest then due 
the term loan is subject to the same debt covenants as our line of credit discussed above 
prepayment of the term loan is allowed at any time 
at august   the applicable interest rate was per annum  and the outstanding principal amount was approximately we currently have several on going capital projects that are important to our long term strategic goals 
these projects include the upcoming move of our humiseal europe ltd manufacturing operations from camberley  uk to a modern facility in winnersh  uk 
additionally  we have the continued renovations to our oxford  ma facility  as well as the recently announced closing of our randolph  ma plant which will be transitioned to our other facilities over the course of a fifteen month transition period 
machinery and equipment will also be added as needed to increase capacity or enhance operating efficiencies in our other manufacturing plants 
we may consider the acquisition of companies or other assets this year or in future periods which are complementary to our business 
we believe that our existing resources  including cash on hand and our line of credit  together with cash generated from operations and additional bank borrowings  will be sufficient to fund our cash flow requirements through at least the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurances that additional financing will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
to the extent that interest rates increase in future periods  we will assess the impact of these higher interest rates on the financial and cash flow projections of our potential acquisitions 
we have no significant off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at august  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
contractual obligations total payments due less than year payments due years payments due years payments after years dollars in thousands long term debt including estimated interest operating leases purchase obligations total we may be required to make payments related to our unrecognized tax benefits 
however  due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with these unrecognized tax benefits  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
accordingly  unrecognized tax benefits of  as of august  have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above

recently issued accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures accounting standards codification asc topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu 
the updated standard requires new disclosures around transfers into and out of levels and in the fair value hierarchy and separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements to be presented separately on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
the three level fair value hierarchy is described in more detail in note to the financial statements filed as part of this annual report on form k 
asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  with early adoption permitted  except for the level reconciliation disclosures which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the portion of the update which was effective for fiscal years beginning after december  was adopted by us effective march  and the adoption did not have any effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the portion of the update which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 business combinations asc topic disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations asu 
this standard update clarifies that  when presenting comparative financial statements  sec registrants should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the current period business combinations had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the update also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
asu is effective prospectively for material either on an individual or aggregate basis business combinations entered into in fiscal years beginning on or after december   with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of asu will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows  however  we may have additional disclosure requirements if a material acquisition occurs 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income asc topic presentation of comprehensive income  asu which amends current comprehensive income guidance 
this accounting update eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders equity 
instead  we must report comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income which contains two sections  net income and other comprehensive income  or in two separate but consecutive statements 
asu will be effective for public companies during the interim and annual periods beginning after december  with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of asu will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as it only requires a change in the format of our current presentation 

table of contents in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other asc topic testing goodwill for impairment  asu which gives companies the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before performing the two step test mandated prior to this update 
asu also provides companies with a revised list of examples of events and circumstances to consider  in their totality  to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if a company concludes that this is the case  it must perform the two step test 
otherwise  a company may skip the two step test 
companies are not required to perform the qualitative assessment and may instead proceed directly to the first step of the two part test 
asu is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect that the adoption of asu to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies  judgments  and estimates the us securities and exchange commission sec requires companies to provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies 
the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company financial condition and operating results  and requires management to make its most significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are described below 
accounts receivable we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
in cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer ability to meet its financial obligations to us  a specific allowance against amounts due to us is recorded  and thereby reduces the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  industry and geographic concentrations  the current business environment and our historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates or if economic conditions worsen  additional allowances may be required in the future  which could have an adverse impact on our future operating results 
inventories we value inventory at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
management assesses the recoverability of inventory based on types and levels of inventory held  forecasted demand and changes in technology 
these assessments require management judgments and estimates  and valuation adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory may be recorded based on these assessments 
we estimate excess and obsolescence exposures based upon assumptions about future demand  product transitions  and market conditions and record reserves to reduce inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
the failure to accurately forecast demand may lead to additional excess and obsolete inventory and future charges 
business combinations we assign the value of the consideration transferred to acquire a business to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition 
we assess the fair value of assets  including intangible assets  using a variety of methods and each asset is measured at fair value from the perspective of a market participant 
the method used to estimate the fair values of intangible assets incorporates significant assumptions regarding the estimates a market participant would make in order to evaluate an asset  including a market participant use of the asset and the appropriate discount rates for a market participant 
assets recorded from the perspective of a market participant that are determined to not have economic use for us are expensed immediately 
any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill 
transaction costs and restructuring costs associated with a transaction to acquire a business are expensed as incurred 

table of contents goodwill  intangible assets  and other long lived assets long lived assets consist of goodwill  identifiable intangible assets  trademarks  patents and agreements and property  plant  and equipment 
intangible assets and property  plant  and equipment  excluding goodwill  are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful life 
we review long lived assets and all intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
goodwill is also reviewed at least annually for impairment 
factors which we consider important and that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results and significant negative industry or economic trends 
we determine whether an impairment has occurred based on gross expected future cash flows for each reporting unit and measure the amount of the impairment based on the related future discounted cash flows for the respective reporting unit 
the cash flow estimates used to determine impairment  if any  contain management best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
see notes to consolidated financial statements 
the estimates of expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control 
changes in these estimates can result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and may result in material charges to the results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  performance of our obligation is complete  our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and we are reasonably assured of collecting 
this is typically at the time of shipment 
if a loss is anticipated on any contract  a provision for the entire loss is made immediately 
revenue recognition involves judgments and assessments of expected returns  and the likelihood of nonpayment due to insolvent customers 
we analyze various factors  including a review of specific customer contracts and shipment terms  historical experience  creditworthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions in determining when to recognize revenue 
changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized with a resulting impact on the timing and amount of associated income 
commissions are recognized when earned and payments are received from the manufacturers represented 
royalty revenue is recognized based on licensee production statements received from the authorized manufacturers 
billed shipping and handling fees are recorded as sales revenue with the associated costs recorded as costs of products and services sold 
contingent income tax liabilities we are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business 
our contingent income tax liabilities are estimated based on the methodology prescribed in the guidance for accounting for uncertain tax positions  which we adopted as of the beginning of fiscal the guidance prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions require an assessment of the probability of the income tax related exposures and settlements and are influenced by our historical audit experiences with various state and federal taxing authorities as well as by current income tax trends 
if circumstances change  we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on our accounting for uncertain tax positions 
deferred income taxes we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
stock based compensation we measure compensation cost for share based compensation at fair value  including estimated forfeitures  and recognize the expense over the period that the recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the 
table of contents award  which generally is the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options 
this model requires significant estimates related to the award expected life and future stock price volatility of the underlying equity security 
in determining the amount of expense to be recorded  we are also required to estimate forfeiture rates for awards  based on the probability that employees will complete the required service period 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 
pension benefits we sponsor a non contributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees of certain divisions of the company 
in calculating our retirement plan obligations and related expense  we make various assumptions and estimates 
these assumptions include discount rates  benefits earned  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension obligations and future expense 
effective december   the defined benefit pension plan was amended to include a soft freeze whereby any employee hired after the effective date of december  will not be admitted to the plan 
the only exception relates to employees of the international association of machinists and aerospace workers union 
all participants who were previously admitted to the plan prior to the december  soft freeze will continue to accrue benefits as detailed in the plan agreements 
we account for our pension plan following the requirements of asc topic  compensation retirement benefits asc 
asc requires an employer to a recognize in its statement of financial position the funded status of a benefit plan  b measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the end of the employer fiscal year with limited exceptions  and c recognize as a component of other comprehensive income  net of tax  the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs pursuant to prior existing guidance 
impact of inflation inflation has not had a significant long term impact on our earnings
