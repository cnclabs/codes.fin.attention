item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following table sets forth the amounts and categories of the bank s non performing assets non performing loans  foreclosed real estate and troubled debt restructurings for the last three years 
it is the policy of the bank that all earned but uncollected interest on all past due loans is reviewed monthly to determine what portion of it should be classified as uncollectible for loans past due in excess of days 
uncollectible interest is written off monthly 
at december in thousands non performing assets non performing loans troubled debt restructured total non performing loans and troubled debt restructured foreclosed real estate total non performing assets total non performing loans  including troubled debt restructured  to net loans total non performing assets to total assets at december   the bank held loans delinquent from to days totaling million 
as of that date  management was not aware of any other assets that would need to be disclosed as non performing assets 
delinquent loans 
the following table sets forth certain information at december    and relating to delinquencies in the bank s portfolio 
delinquent loans that are days or more past due are considered non performing assets

federal regulations and the bank s asset classification policy provide for the classification of loans and other assets such as debt and equity securities of lesser quality as substandard  doubtful  or loss assets 
an asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard  with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted 
an insured institution is required to establish general allowances for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management for loans classified substandard or doubtful  as well as for other problem loans 
general allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities  but which  unlike specific allowances  have not been allocated to particular problem assets 
when an insured institution classifies problem assets as loss  it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to of the amount of the asset so classified or to charge off such amount 
an institution s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the ots  which can order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances 
the bank regularly reviews its loan portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulation 
not all of the bank s classified assets constitute non performing assets  although the balances of non performing loans as a percent of total classified is higher than in prior years 
historically  management has been conservative in its listing of assets as classified  especially in comparison to peer classification of similar assets and to actual delinquency status 
whereas classified loans for the bank historically have been a conservative list of loans warranting scrutiny  in and the classified list has become weighted heavily by loans and relationships in the lengthy process of foreclosure 
the mating of the conservative approach in monitoring problem loans and loans lingering due to foreclosure has created a larger than historical balance of classified assets 
as a result  the bank remains somewhat higher than peer on balances of loans classified 
the classification of assets listing is evaluated monthly by a committee comprised of lending personnel  the bank chief executive officer  the chief financial officer  loan review personnel and the bank s internal auditor 
the list encompasses entire relationships  rather than single problem loans  and removal of loans from the list is only approved by the committee upon demonstrated performance by the borrower 
at december   the bank s classified assets  were as follows at december  in thousands substandard assets doubtful assets loss assets total classified assets regulatory definition requires that total classified assets include classified loans  which at december  included million as substandard and  as doubtful  other real estate owned as a result of foreclosure or other legal proceedings of  also considered substandard  and two below investment grade corporate securities  considered substandard  totaling  detail of classified loans by loan segment is provided in footnote to the consolidated financial statements presented later in this report on form k 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained through the provision for loan losses  which is charged to earnings 
the provision for loan losses is determined in conjunction with management s review and evaluation of current economic conditions including those of the bank s lending area  changes in the character and size of the loan portfolio  loan delinquencies current status as well as past and anticipated trends and adequacy of collateral securing loan delinquencies  historical and estimated net charge offs and other pertinent information derived from a review of the loan portfolio 
in management s opinion  the bank s allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable incurred losses from loans at december  however  there can be no assurance that regulators  when reviewing the bank s loan portfolio in the future  will not require increases in its allowances for loan losses or that changes in economic conditions will not adversely affect the bank s loan portfolio 
at december  the allowance for loan losses included million in specific reserves for loan losses 
none were included at december  as all previously reserved amounts were recorded as partial charge offs as of that date 
during the fourth quarter of  in compliance with regulatory guidance and in reaction to the economic factors at work  management reviewed and revised the methodolgy for evaluating the adequacy of its allowance for loan and lease losses 
management made the following changes to the methodology increased segmentation of loan types 
previously the bank used general loan groups to evaluate historical charge off activity 
this was acceptable due to the historically minimal amount of charge off activity and the low delinquency rates experienced by the bank 
historical analysis of four general loan groups was expanded to regulatory groupings  each relative to a specific risk related loan type 
each of the groups was evaluated for charge off activity and relevance to the existing loan portfolio  in arriving at historical loss factors by group 
these loss factors are used in arriving at estimates as to the adequacy of the allowance 
decrease in historical look back period 
previously the bank used a five year historical period in evaluating loss experience 
this was reduced to three years to more timely and accurately reflect the effect of the recent economic downturn 
increased evaluation of concentration areas 
commercial relationships were reviewed during the fourth quarter of and areas of risk concentration were identified 
this allowed management to target these areas in the allowance analysis and establish the capability to compare these concentrations and any associated losses going forward 
this data is as of yet only potentially useful as the realized charge offs of the bank for the concentration areas have been low  and in most instances nonexistent 
as charge offs of these concentration areas occur  experience data can be formed 
inclusion of specific reserve allocations in historical averages partial charge off of previously allocated specific reserves 
management has been proactive and prudent in identifying the potential for loss on specific loans and loan relationships  and in prior periods has established specific reserves within the allowance for loan loss for those potential losses 
specific reserves are estimates  based on collected data such as updated appraisals  analysis of the financial condition of the borrower  and estimates of the outcome in the event of failure of the loan 
specific reserves are not realized charge offs since the outcome of the loan relationship is undetermined 
regulatory pressure has been to include these specific reserve estimates as realized charge offs in the computation of historical charge off data and management s analysis complies 
since these are estimates of loss  the ultimate charge off amount could vary 
summary of loan loss experience

the bank s investment portfolio excluding mortgage backed securities consists of us government and agency obligations  corporate bonds  municipal securities and federal home loan bank fhlb stock 
at december   total investments in the portfolio  as defined above and including mortgage backed securities  had a combined carrying value of approximately million  or  of the consolidated total assets 
investments reported in the financial statements of the company are held both at the bank level and at the bank s nevada subsidiaries 
all company investments are available for sale  but the intent of the company is to hold investments to maturity 
liquidity is met through a combination of deposit growth  borrowing from the federal home loan bank of indianapolis  and if needed  sale of investments held at the bank level 
securities held through the nevada subsidiaries are held primarily for investment purposes 
securities held at the bank level are held primarily for liquidity purposes 
in  liquidity needs were met primarily through deposit growth and the same held true for sales of investments over the last months have been made primarily to take advantage of gain positions on short term investments  especially those expected to be called in the near future  while funds from maturing investments were reinvested primarily into high quality mortage backed securities and long term municipals 
the portfolio declined by million from december  to the same date in  as million in us government and agency securities  most at yields of less than  were replaced with higher yielding  high quality mortgage backed million and municipal million securities

the bank maintains a portfolio of mortgage backed pass through securities in the form of fhlmc  fnma and government national mortgage association gnma participation certificates 
mortgage backed pass through securities generally entitle the bank to receive a portion of the cash flows from an identified pool of mortgages and gives the bank an interest in that pool of mortgages 
fhlmc  fnma and gnma securities are each guaranteed by its respective agencies as to principal and interest 
although mortgage backed securities generally yield less than individual loans originated by the bank  they present less credit risk 
because mortgage backed securities have a lower yield relative to current market rates  retention of such investments could adversely affect the bank s earnings  particularly in a rising interest rate environment 
the mortgage backed securities portfolio is generally considered to have very low credit risk because the securities are guaranteed as to principal repayment by the issuing agency 
in addition  the bank has purchased adjustable rate mortgage backed securities as part of its effort to reduce its interest rate risk 
in a period of declining interest rates  the bank is subject to prepayment risk on such adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
the bank attempts to mitigate this prepayment risk by purchasing mortgage backed securities at or near par 
if interest rates rise in general  the interest rates on the loans backing the mortgage backed securities will also adjust upward  subject to the interest rate caps in the underlying mortgage loans 
however  the bank is still subject to interest rate risk on such securities if interest rates rise faster than to maximum annual interest rate adjustments on the underlying loans 
at december   the bank had mortgage backed securities with a carrying value of approximately million  all of which were classified as available for sale 
these mortgage backed securities may be used as collateral for borrowings and  through repayments  as a source of liquidity

deposits have traditionally been the bank s primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities 
in addition to deposits  the bank derives funds from scheduled loan payments  investment maturities  loan prepayments  retained earnings  income on earning assets  and borrowings 
while scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds  deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates  market conditions  and levels of competition 
borrowings from the fhlb of indianapolis may be used in the short term to compensate for reductions in deposits or deposit inflows at less than projected levels 
deposits 
deposits are attracted through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments including fixed rate certificates of deposit  now  mmdas and other transaction accounts  individual retirement accounts and savings accounts 
the bank actively solicits and advertises for deposits outside of jefferson county 
since the opening of our branches in sellersburg  indiana clark county  charlestown  indiana clark county  floyds knobs and new albany  indiana floyd county and the branch in carrollton  kentucky carroll county  the bank s market area has expanded 
the bank began operating the new albany branch in the second quarter of  which has enhanced the existing services provided by the bank for that area 
deposits will come from all of our market area 
deposit account terms vary  with the principal differences being the minimum balance required  the amount of time the funds remain on deposit and the interest rate 
the bank does not pay a fee for any deposits it receives 
interest rates paid  maturity terms  service fees and withdrawal penalties are established by the bank on a periodic basis 
determination of rates and terms are predicated on funds acquisition and liquidity requirements  rates paid by competitors  growth goals and applicable regulations 
the bank relies  in part  on customer service and long standing relationships with customers to attract and retain its deposits  but also closely prices its deposits in relation to rates offered by its competitors 
the flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions  changes in money market and prevailing interest rates and competition 
the variety of deposit accounts offered by the bank has allowed it to be competitive in obtaining funds and to respond with flexibility to changes in consumer demand 
the bank has become more susceptible to short term fluctuations in deposit flows as customers have become more interest rate conscious 
the bank manages the pricing of its deposits in keeping with its asset liability management and profitability objectives 
historically  now and mmdas have been relatively stable sources of deposits 
during  transactional deposits  and primarily now and mmda deposits  increased negligibly from million at december  to million at december   an increase of million  or 
the ability of the bank to attract and maintain certificates of deposit  and the rates paid on these deposits  have been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions 
as customers continued to pursue more stable deposit products during  certificate of deposit balances increased million  or  from the balance of million as of december  to million at december  as certificates of deposit repriced and new certificates were added  the lower interest rates for these items caused a decline in the cost of deposits 
as a result  cost of deposits at december  was as compared to at december   a drop of basis points  period to period

at december   the bank had million in fhlb advances 
during  the bank used excess funds to pay down borrowings with the fhlb  reducing total borrowed funds by million over the period 
the bank does not anticipate any difficulty in obtaining advances appropriate to meet its requirements in the future

in addition  federal regulations permit associations to make specified types of loans to such subsidiaries other than special purpose finance subsidiaries in which the association owns more than of the stock  in an aggregate amount not exceeding of the association s regulatory capital if the association s regulatory capital is in compliance with applicable regulations 
a savings association that acquires a non savings association subsidiary  or that elects to conduct a new activity within a subsidiary  must give the federal deposit insurance corporation  the office of thrift supervision and the department of financial institutions at least days advance written notice 
the federal deposit insurance corporation may  after consultation with the office of thrift supervision  prohibit specified activities if it determines such activities pose a serious threat to the deposit insurance fund 
moreover  a savings association must deduct from capital  for purposes of meeting the core capital  tangible capital and risk based capital requirements  its entire investment in and loans to a subsidiary engaged in activities not permissible for a national bank other than exclusively agency activities for its customers or mortgage banking subsidiaries 
the bank s wholly owned subsidiary  madison st service corporation  which was incorporated under the laws of the state of indiana on july   currently holds land but does not otherwise engage in significant business activities 
during  the bank established in nevada three new subsidiaries rvfb investments  inc  rvfb holdings  inc and rvfb portfolio  llc to hold and manage a significant portion of the bank s investment portfolio

the sole purpose of the trust is to issue and sell certain securities representing undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the trust and to invest the proceeds thereof in certain debentures of the company 
employees as of december   the bank employed persons on a full time basis and persons on a part time basis 
none of the employees is represented by a collective bargaining group 
management considers its employee relations to be good 
competition the bank originates most of its loans to and accepts most of its deposits from residents of jefferson  floyd and clark counties  indiana  and trimble and carroll counties  kentucky 
the bank is subject to competition from various financial institutions  including state and national banks  state and federal savings associations  credit unions and certain non banking consumer lenders that provide similar services in jefferson  floyd and clark counties in indiana  and trimble  carroll and jefferson counties in kentucky and which have significantly larger resources available to them than does the bank 
in total  there are approximately financial institutions located in the county market area  including the bank 
the bank also competes with money market funds with respect to deposit accounts and with insurance companies with respect to individual retirement accounts 
the primary factors influencing competition for deposits are interest rates  service and convenience of office locations 
the bank competes for loan originations primarily through the efficiency and quality of services it provides borrowers and through interest rates and loan fees charged 
competition is affected by  among other things  the general availability of lendable funds  general and local economic conditions  current interest rate levels and other factors that are not readily predictable 
regulation general as a federally chartered  fdic insured savings association  and until july   the bank is subject to extensive regulation by the ots and the fdic 
for example  the bank must obtain ots approval before it may engage in certain activities and must file reports with the ots regarding its activities and financial condition 
the ots periodically examines the bank s books and records and  in conjunction with the fdic in certain situations  has examination and enforcement powers 
this supervision and regulation are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the federal deposit insurance fund 
a savings association must pay a semi annual assessment to the ots based upon a marginal assessment rate that decreases as the asset size of the savings association increases  and which includes a fixed cost component that is assessed on all savings associations 
the assessment rate that applies to a savings association depends upon the institution s size  condition and the complexity of its operations 
the bank s semi annual assessment is approximately  the bank is also subject to federal and state regulation as to such matters as loans to officers  directors  or principal shareholders  required reserves  limitations as to the nature and amount of its loans and investments  regulatory approval of any merger or consolidation  issuances or retirements of its securities  and limitations upon other aspects of banking operations 
in addition  the bank s activities and operations are subject to a number of additional detailed  complex and sometimes overlapping federal and state laws and regulations 
these include state usury and consumer credit laws  state laws relating to fiduciaries  the federal truth in lending act and regulation z  the federal equal credit opportunity act and regulation b  the fair credit reporting act  the community reinvestment act  anti redlining legislation  antitrust laws and regulations protecting the confidentiality of consumer financial information 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act calls for the elimination of the ots as of july   although this deadline can be extended for an additional six months 
the dodd frank act transfers to the office of the comptroller of the currency the occ all functions and all rulemaking authority of the ots relating to federal savings associations 
the dodd frank act also transfers to the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve all functions of the ots relating to savings and loan holding companies and their non depository institution subsidiaries 
thus  the holding company and all of its subsidiaries other than the bank will be supervised by the federal reserve from and after july   subject to a possible six month extension 
the federal reserve is also to regulate loans to insiders  transactions with affiliates  and tying arrangements 
no later than the effective date of the transfer of these responsibilities  the occ and the federal reserve are to publish regulations that will apply to the entities that they are to regulate for the first time 
ots guidance  orders  interpretations  and policies to which federal savings associations like the bank and savings and loan holding companies like the holding company are subject are to remain in effect until they are suspended 
savings and loan holding company regulation as the holding company for the bank  the holding company is regulated as a non diversified savings and loan holding company within the meaning of the home owners loan act  as amended hola  and is currently subject to regulatory oversight by the director of the ots 
as such  the holding company is registered with the ots and is thereby subject to ots regulations  examinations  supervision and reporting requirements 
as a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company  the bank is subject to certain restrictions in its dealings with the holding company and with other companies affiliated with the holding company 
as indicated above  effective as of july  subject to a possible six month extension supervision of the holding company and its non bank subsidiaries will be transferred to the federal reserve 
in general  the hola prohibits a savings and loan holding company  without obtaining the prior approval of the director of the ots  from acquiring control of another savings association or savings and loan holding company or retaining more than of the voting shares of a savings association or of another holding company which is not a subsidiary 
the hola also restricts the ability of a director or officer of the holding company  or any person who owns more than of the holding company s stock  from acquiring control of another savings association or savings and loan holding company without obtaining the prior approval of the director of the ots 
the holding company currently operates as a unitary savings and loan holding company 
prior to the enactment of the gramm leach bliley act the glb act in  there were no restrictions on the permissible business activities of a unitary savings and loan holding company 
the glb act included a provision that prohibits any new unitary savings and loan holding company  defined as a company that acquires a thrift after may   from engaging in commercial activities 
this provision also includes a grandfather clause  however  that permits a company that was a savings and loan holding company as of may   or had an application to become a savings and loan holding company on file with the ots as of that date  to acquire and continue to control a thrift and to continue to engage in commercial activities 
because the holding company qualifies under this grandfather provision  the glb act did not affect the holding company s authority to engage in diversified business activities 
under the dodd frank act  the federal reserve may require these grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding companies to segregate any nonfinancial activities into an intermediate holding company which could facilitate supervision of such entity by the federal reserve 
if the holding company were to acquire control of another savings association other than through a merger or other business combination with the bank  the holding company would thereupon become a multiple savings and loan holding company 
except where such acquisition is pursuant to the authority to approve emergency thrift acquisitions and where each subsidiary savings association meets the qualified thrift lender qtl test  the activities of the holding company and any of its subsidiaries other than the bank or other subsidiary savings associations would thereafter be subject to further restrictions 
the hola provides that  among other things  a multiple savings and loan holding company may not  either directly or acting through a subsidiary that is not a savings association  conduct  any business activity other than i furnishing or performing management services for a subsidiary savings association  ii conducting an insurance agency or escrow business  iii holding  managing  or liquidating assets owned by or acquired from a subsidiary savings association  iv holding or managing properties used or occupied by a subsidiary savings association  v acting as trustee under deeds of trust  vi those activities in which multiple savings and loan holding companies were authorized by regulation to directly engage on march   or vii those activities authorized by the federal reserve board as permissible for bank holding companies  unless the director of the ots by regulation prohibits or limits such activities for savings and loan holding companies 
those activities described in vii above must also be approved by the director of the ots before a multiple savings and loan holding company may engage in such activities 
acquisitions resulting in the formation of a multiple savings and loan holding company which controls savings associations in more than one state may also be approved  if the multiple savings and loan holding company involved controls a savings association which operated a home or branch office in the state of the association to be acquired as of march   or if the laws of the state in which the association to be acquired is located specifically permit associations to be acquired by state chartered associations or savings and loan holding companies located in the state where the acquiring entity is located or by a holding company that controls such state chartered savings associations 
acquisitions resulting in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings associations in more than one state in the case of certain emergency thrift acquisitions may also be approved 
notwithstanding the above rules as to permissible business activities of savings and loan holding companies  if the savings association subsidiary of such a holding company fails to meet the qtl test  then such holding company would be deemed to be a bank holding company subject to all of the provisions of the bank holding company act of and other statutes applicable to bank holding companies  to the same extent as if the holding company were a bank holding company and the bank were a bank 
see item business regulation qualified thrift lender 
in addition  under the dodd frank act  a savings association that fails the qualified thrift lender test will be prohibited from paying dividends  except for dividends that are permissible for national banks  are necessary to meet obligations of the company that controls the savings association  and are specifically approved by the occ and the federal reserve 
such failure to satisfy the qualified thrift lender test may also result in enforcement actions 
at december   the bank s asset composition was in excess of that required to qualify as a qualified thrift lender 
indiana law permits federal and state savings association holding companies with their home offices located outside of indiana to acquire savings associations whose home offices are located in indiana and savings association holding companies with their principal place of business in indiana indiana savings association holding companies upon receipt of approval by the indiana department of financial institutions 
moreover  indiana savings association holding companies may acquire savings associations with their home offices located outside of indiana and savings association holding companies with their principal place of business located outside of indiana upon receipt of approval by the indiana department of financial institutions 
federal home loan bank system the bank is a member of the fhlb system  which consists of regional banks 
the federal housing finance board fhfb  an independent agency  controls the fhlb system including the fhlb of indianapolis 
the fhlb system provides a central credit facility primarily for member financial institutions 
at december   the bank s investment in stock of the fhlb of indianapolis was million 
for the fiscal year ended december   the fhlb of indianapolis paid approximately  in cash dividends to the bank 
annualized  this income would have a rate of 
the rate paid during the period ended december  was lower than in previous periods due to the various financial difficulties in the financial industry  including the write down in value of various mortgage backed securities held by the fhlb of indianapolis 
all fhlbs are required to provide funds to establish affordable housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances to members to be used for lending at subsidized interest rates for low and moderate income  owner occupied housing projects  affordable rental housing  and certain other community projects 
these contributions and obligations could adversely affect the value of fhlb stock in the future 
a reduction in the value of such stock may result in a corresponding reduction in the bank s capital 
the fhlb of indianapolis serves as a reserve or central bank for its member institutions 
it is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the fhlb system 
it makes advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the fhlb and the board of directors of the fhlb of indianapolis 
all fhlb advances must be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the fhlb 
eligible collateral includes first mortgage loans not more than days delinquent or securities evidencing interests therein  securities including mortgage backed securities issued  insured or guaranteed by the federal government or any agency thereof  cash or fhlb deposits  certain small business and agricultural loans of smaller institutions and real estate with readily ascertainable value in which a perfected security interest may be obtained 
other forms of collateral may be accepted as additional security or  under certain circumstances  to renew outstanding advances 
all long term advances are required to provide funds for residential home financing  and the fhlb has established standards of community service that members must meet to maintain access to long term advances 
at december  the bank had million in such borrowings  with an additional million available  previously approved by the board of directors 
interest rates charged for advances vary depending upon maturity  the cost of funds to the fhlb of indianapolis and the purpose of the borrowing 
federal reserve system the federal reserve requires all depository institutions to maintain noninterest bearing reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts  which are primarily checking and now accounts  and non personal time deposits 
at december   the bank was in compliance with those reserve requirements 
insurance of deposits deposits in the bank are insured by the deposit insurance fund of the fdic up to a maximum amount  which is generally  per depositor  subject to aggregation rules 
the bank is subject to deposit insurance assessments by the fdic pursuant to its regulations establishing a risk related deposit insurance assessment system  based upon the institution s capital levels and risk profile 
under the fdic s risk based assessment system  insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk weighted categories based on supervisory evaluations  regulatory capital levels  and certain other factors with less risky institutions paying lower assessments 
an institution s initial assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned 
there are also adjustments to a bank s initial assessment rates based on levels of long term unsecured debt  secured liabilities in excess of of domestic deposits and  for certain institutions  brokered deposit levels 
for  initial assessments ranged from to basis points of assessable deposits  and the bank paid assessments at the rate of basis points for each of insured deposits 
the bank is also subject to assessment for the financing corporation fico to service the interest on its bond obligations 
the amount assessed on individual institutions  including the bank  by fico is in addition to the amount paid for deposit insurance according to the risk related assessment rate schedule 
these assessments will continue until the fico bonds are repaid between and during  the fico assessment rate ranged between and basis points for each of insured deposits per quarter 
for the first quarter of  the fico assessment rate is basis points 
the bank expensed deposit insurance assessments including the fico assessments of  during the year ended december  future increases in deposit insurance premiums or changes in risk classification would increase the bank s deposit related costs 
on december   banks were required to pay the fourth quarter fdic assessment and to prepay estimated insurance assessments for the years through on that date 
the prepayment did not affect the bank s earnings on that date 
the bank paid an aggregate of million in premiums on december   million of which constituted prepaid premiums 
under the dodd frank act  the fdic is authorized to set the reserve ratio for the deposit insurance fund at no less than  and must achieve the designated reserve ratio by september  the fdic must offset the effect of the increase in the minimum designated reserve ratio from to on insured depository institutions of less than billion  and may declare dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio at the end of a calendar quarter is at least  although the fdic has the authority to suspend or limit such permitted dividend declarations 
in december   the fdic adopted a final rule setting the designated reserve ratio for the deposit insurance fund at of estimated insured deposits 
on october   the fdic proposed a comprehensive long range plan for deposit insurance fund management with the goals of maintaining a positive fund balance  even during periods of large fund losses  and maintaining steady  predictable assessment rates throughout economic and credit cycles 
the fdic determined not to increase assessments in by basis points  as previously proposed  but to keep the current rate schedule in effect 
in addition  the fdic proposed adopting a lower assessment rate schedule when the designated reserve ratio reaches so that the average rate over time should be about basis points 
in lieu of dividends  the fdic proposed adopting lower rate schedules when the reserve ratio reaches and  so that the average rates will decline about percent and percent  respectively 
under the dodd frank act  the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums is to be changed from adjusted domestic deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity 
tangible equity for this purpose means tier capital 
since this is a larger base than adjusted domestic deposits  assessment rates are expected to be lowered 
in february  the fdic approved a new rule effective april  to be reflected in invoices for assessments due september   which will implement these changes 
the proposed rule includes new rate schedules scaled to the increase in the assessment base  including schedules that will go into effect when the reserve ratio reaches  and 
the fdic staff projected that the new rate schedules would be approximately revenue neutral 
the schedule would reduce the initial base assessment rate in each of the four risk based pricing categories 
for small risk category i banks  the rates would range from basis points 
the proposed rates for small institutions in risk categories ii  iii and iv would be  and basis points  respectively 
for large institutions and large  highly complex institutions  the proposed rate schedule ranges from to basis points 
there are also adjustments made to the initial assessment rates based on long term unsecured debt  depository institution debt  and brokered deposits 
the fdic also revised the assessment system for large depository institutions with over billion in assets 
due to the recent difficult economic conditions  the fdic adopted an optional temporary liquidity guarantee program by which  for a fee  noninterest bearing transaction accounts would receive unlimited insurance coverage until june  which was later extended to december  and  for a fee  certain senior unsecured debt issued by institutions and their holding companies between october  and october  would be guaranteed by the fdic through december  the bank made the business decision to participate in the unlimited noninterest bearing transaction account coverage and the bank and the company elected to participate in the unsecured debt guarantee program  but do not expect to receive an fdic guarantee for any debt under the program 
the assessments for unlimited noninterest bearing transaction account coverage were basis points per of insured deposits during the assessments for unsecured debt guarantee program coverage ranged from to basis points per annum per of debt depending on the maturity of the debt 
the dodd frank act extended unlimited insurance on noninterest bearing accounts for no additional charges through december  under this program  traditional noninterest demand deposit or checking accounts that allow for an unlimited number of transfers and withdrawals at any time  whether held for a business  individual  or other type of depositor  are covered 
later  congress added lawyers trust accounts iolta to this unlimited insurance protection through december  the federal deposit insurance corporation has authority to increase insurance assessments 
a significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the bank 
management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future 
the fdic may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if the fdic determines  after a hearing  that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe and unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  order or any condition imposed in writing by  or written agreement with  the fdic 
the fdic may also suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for a permanent termination of insurance if the institution has no tangible capital 
savings association regulatory capital currently  savings associations are subject to three separate minimum capital to assets requirements i a leverage limit  ii a tangible capital requirement  and iii a risk based capital requirement 
the leverage limit requires that savings associations maintain core capital of at least of total assets 
core capital is generally defined as common shareholders equity including retained earnings  non cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus  certain minority equity interests in subsidiaries  qualifying supervisory goodwill  purchased mortgage servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships subject to certain limits less non qualifying intangibles 
the ots requires a core capital level of of total adjusted assets for savings associations that receive the highest supervisory rating for safety and soundness  and no less than for all other savings associations 
under the tangible capital requirement  a savings association must maintain tangible capital core capital less all intangible assets except purchased mortgage servicing rights which may be included after making the above noted adjustment in an amount up to of tangible capital of at least of total assets 
under the risk based capital requirements  a minimum amount of capital must be maintained by a savings association to account for the relative risks inherent in the type and amount of assets held by the savings association 
the risk based capital requirement requires a savings association to maintain capital defined generally for these purposes as core capital plus general valuation allowances and permanent or maturing capital instruments such as preferred stock and subordinated debt less assets required to be deducted equal to of risk weighted assets 
assets are ranked as to risk in one of four categories 
a credit risk free asset  such as cash  requires no risk based capital  while an asset with a significant credit risk  such as a non accrual loan  requires a risk factor of 
moreover  a savings association must deduct from capital  for purposes of meeting the core capital  tangible capital and risk based capital requirements  its entire investment in and loans to a subsidiary engaged in activities not permissible for a national bank other than exclusively agency activities for its customers or mortgage banking subsidiaries 
at december   the bank was in compliance with all capital requirements imposed by law 
if an association is not in compliance with the capital requirements  the ots is required to prohibit asset growth and to impose a capital directive that may restrict  among other things  the payment of dividends and officers compensation 
in addition  the ots and the fdic generally are authorized to take enforcement actions against a savings association that fails to meet its capital requirements 
these actions may include restricting the operations activities of the association  imposing a capital directive  cease and desist order  or civil money penalties  or imposing harsher measures such as appointing a receiver or conservator or forcing the association to merge into another institution 
holding company regulatory capital effective as of the transfer of regulatory responsibilities from the ots to the occ and the federal reserve  the federal reserve will be authorized to establish capital requirements for savings and loan holding companies 
these capital requirements must be counter cyclical so that the required amount of capital increases in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction  consistent with safety and soundness 
savings and loan holding companies will also be required to serve as a source of financial strength for their depository institution subsidiaries 
within five years after the enactment of the dodd frank act  the federal reserve is to apply consolidated capital requirements to depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent than those currently applied to depository institutions that were not supervised by the federal reserve as of may  under this provision  the components of tier capital of depository institution holding companies would be restricted to capital instruments that are currently considered tier capital for insured depository institutions 
thus  for the first time savings and loan holding companies will be subject to consolidated capital requirements 
under these standards  trust preferred securities will be excluded from tier capital unless such securities were issued prior to may   by a savings and loan holding company with less than billion in assets 
the holding company has issued trust preferred securities  but they were issued prior to may   and therefore are not subject to this new capital restriction 
under the dodd frank act  the holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to the bank and to commit resources to support the bank in circumstances in which the holding company might not otherwise do so 
for this purpose  source of financial strength means the holding company s ability to provide financial assistance to the bank in the event of the bank s financial distress 
prompt corrective regulatory action the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fedicia requires  among other things  that federal bank regulatory authorities take prompt corrective action with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
for these purposes  fedicia establishes five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
at december   the bank was categorized as well capitalized  meaning that its total risk based capital ratio exceeded  its tier i risk based capital ratio exceeded  its leverage ratio exceeded  and it was not subject to a regulatory order  agreement or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure 
the fdic may order savings associations which have insufficient capital to take corrective actions 
for example  a savings association which is categorized as undercapitalized would be subject to growth limitations and would be required to submit a capital restoration plan  and a holding company that controls such a savings association would be required to guarantee that the savings association complies with the restoration plan 
significantly undercapitalized savings associations would be subject to additional restrictions 
savings associations deemed by the fdic to be critically undercapitalized would be subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator 
dividend limitations the ots also restricts the amount of capital distributions that may be made by savings associations 
the applicable regulation defines a capital distribution as a distribution of cash or other property to a savings association s owners  made on account of their ownership 
this definition includes a savings association s payment of cash dividends to shareholders  or any payment by a savings association to repurchase  redeem  retire  or otherwise acquire any of its shares or debt instruments that are included in total capital  and any extension of credit to finance an affiliate s acquisition of those shares or interests 
the regulation does not apply to dividends consisting only of a savings association s shares or rights to purchase such shares 
the regulation requires a savings association to file an application for approval of a proposed capital distribution with the ots if the association is not eligible for expedited treatment under ots application processing rules  or the total amount of all capital distributions  including the proposed capital distribution  for the applicable calendar year would exceed an amount equal to the savings association s net income for that year to date plus the savings association s retained net income for the preceding two years the retained net income standard 
a savings association must also file an application for approval of a proposed capital distribution if  following the proposed distribution  the association would not be at least adequately capitalized under the ots prompt corrective action regulations  or if the proposed distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any applicable statute  regulation  or agreement between the association and the ots or the fdic 
the regulation requires a savings association to file a notice of a proposed capital distribution in lieu of an application if the association or the proposed capital distribution is not required to file an application  and the savings association will not be at least as well capitalized as defined under the ots prompt corrective action regulations following the capital distribution  the capital distribution would reduce the amount of  or retire any part of the savings association s common or preferred stock  or retire any part of debt instruments such as notes or debentures included in the association s capital under the ots capital regulation  or the savings association is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company 
because the bank is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company  this latter provision requires  at a minimum  that the bank file a notice with the ots days before making any capital distributions to the holding company 
in addition to these regulatory restrictions  the bank s plan of conversion imposes additional limitations on the amount of capital distributions it may make to the holding company 
the plan of conversion requires the bank to establish and maintain a liquidation account for the benefit of eligible account holders and supplemental eligible account holders and prohibits the bank from making capital distributions to the holding company if its net worth would be reduced below the amount required for the liquidation account 
the holding company s declaration of dividends is subject to indiana law  which generally prohibits the payment of dividends to amounts that will not affect the ability of the holding company  after the dividend has been distributed  to pay its debts in the ordinary course of business 
moreover  such dividends may not exceed the difference between the holding company s total assets and total liabilities plus preferential amounts payable to shareholders with rights superior to those of the holders of common stock 
in addition  the ots may prohibit the holding company s payment of dividends if it concludes such payment would raise safety and soundness concerns at either the bank or the holding company 
similar restrictions could be applied to dividend declarations by the federal reserve once it replaces the ots as the federal regulator of the holding company 
limitations on rates paid for deposits regulations promulgated by the fdic pursuant to fedicia place limitations on the ability of insured depository institutions to accept  renew or roll over deposits by offering rates of interest which are significantly higher than the prevailing rates of interest on deposits offered by other insured depository institutions having the same type of charter in the institution s normal market area 
under these regulations  well capitalized depository institutions may accept  renew  or roll such deposits over without restriction  adequately capitalized depository institutions may accept  renew or roll such deposits over with a waiver from the fdic subject to certain restrictions on payments of rates and undercapitalized depository institutions may not accept  renew or roll such deposits over 
the regulations contemplate that the definitions of well capitalized  adequately capitalized and undercapitalized will be the same as the definition adopted by the agencies to implement the corrective action provisions of fedicia 
management does not believe that these regulations will have a materially adverse effect on the bank s current operations 
liquidity the financial regulatory relief and economic efficiency act of repealed the former statutory requirement that all savings associations maintain an average daily balance of liquid assets in a minimum amount of not less than or more than of their withdrawable accounts plus short term borrowings 
the ots adopted a rule that implemented this revised statutory requirement  although savings associations remain subject to the ots regulation that requires them to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure their safe and sound operation 
safety and soundness standards the federal banking agencies have adopted final safety and soundness standards for all insured depository institutions 
the standards  which were issued in the form of guidelines rather than regulations  relate to internal controls  information systems  internal audit systems  loan underwriting and documentation  compensation  interest rate exposure  asset quality and earnings standards 
in general  the standards are designed to assist the federal banking agencies in identifying and addressing problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired 
if an institution fails to meet these standards  the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to submit a compliance plan 
failure to submit a compliance plan may result in enforcement proceedings 
real estate lending standards ots regulations require savings associations to establish and maintain written internal real estate lending policies 
each association s lending policies must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices and be appropriate to the size of the association and the nature and scope of its operations 
the policies must establish loan portfolio diversification standards  establish prudent underwriting standards  including loan to value limits  that are clear and measurable  establish loan administration procedures for the association s real estate portfolio  and establish documentation  approval and reporting requirements to monitor compliance with the association s real estate lending policies 
the association s written real estate lending policies must be reviewed and approved by the association s board of directors at least annually 
further  each association is expected to monitor conditions in its real estate market to ensure that its lending policies continue to be appropriate for current market conditions 
loans to one borrower under ots regulations  the bank may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of of its unimpaired capital and surplus 
additional amounts may be lent  not in excess of of unimpaired capital and surplus  if such loans or extensions of credit are fully secured by readily marketable collateral  including certain debt and equity securities but not including real estate 
in some cases  a savings association may lend up to percent of unimpaired capital and surplus to one borrower for purposes of developing domestic residential housing  provided that the association meets its regulatory capital requirements and the ots authorizes the association to use this expanded lending authority 
at december   all of the bank s loans were within the current legal lending limit of million 
while the current economic conditions can quickly change lending relationships  at this time management does not believe that the loans to one borrower limits will have a significant impact on the bank s business operations or earnings 
qualified thrift lender savings associations must meet a qtl test that requires the association to maintain an appropriate level of qualified thrift investments qtis primarily residential mortgages and related investments  including certain mortgage related securities and otherwise to qualify as a qtl 
the required percentage of qtis is of portfolio assets defined as all assets minus intangible assets  property used by the association in conducting its business and liquid assets equal to of total assets 
certain assets are subject to a percentage limitation of of portfolio assets 
in addition  savings associations may include shares of stock of the fhlbs  fnma  and fhlmc as qtis 
compliance with the qtl test is determined on a monthly basis in nine out of every twelve months 
as of december   the bank was in compliance with its qtl requirement  with approximately of its portfolio assets invested in qtis 
a savings association which fails to meet the qtl test must either convert to a bank or be subject to the following penalties i it may not enter into any new activity except for those permissible for a national bank and for a savings association and ii its branching activities shall be limited to those of a national bank 
in addition  under the dodd frank act  a savings association that fails the qtl test will be prohibited from paying dividends  except for dividends that are permissible for national banks  are necessary to meet obligations of the company that controls the savings association  and are specifically approved by the occ and the federal reserve 
the failure to satisfy the qtl test may also result in regulatory enforcement action 
three years after failing the qtl test the association must dispose of any investment or activity not permissible for a national bank and a savings association 
if such a savings association is controlled by a savings and loan holding company  then such holding company must  within a prescribed time period  become registered as a bank holding company and become subject to all rules and regulations applicable to bank holding companies including restrictions as to the scope of permissible business activities 
acquisitions or dispositions and branching the bank holding company act specifically authorizes a bank holding company  upon receipt of appropriate regulatory approvals  to acquire control of any savings association or holding company thereof wherever located 
similarly  a savings and loan holding company may acquire control of a bank 
moreover  federal savings associations may acquire or be acquired by any insured depository institution 
savings associations acquired by bank holding companies may be converted to banks  but as such they become subject to branching and activity restrictions applicable to banks 
subject to certain exceptions  commonly controlled banks and savings associations must reimburse the fdic for any losses suffered in connection with a failed bank or savings association affiliate 
institutions are commonly controlled if one is owned by another or if both are owned by the same holding company 
such claims by the fdic under this provision are subordinate to claims of depositors  secured creditors  and holders of subordinated debt  other than affiliates 
the ots has adopted regulations which permit nationwide branching to the extent permitted by federal statute 
federal statutes permit federal savings associations to branch outside of their home state if the association meets the domestic building and loan test in a of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code or the asset composition test of c of the code 
branching that would result in the formation of a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings associations in more than one state is permitted if the law of the state in which the savings association to be acquired is located specifically authorizes acquisitions of its state chartered associations by state chartered associations or their holding companies in the state where the acquiring association or holding company is located 
moreover  indiana banks and savings associations are permitted to acquire other indiana banks and savings associations and to establish branches throughout indiana 
finally  the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of the riegle neal act permits bank holding companies to acquire banks in other states and  with state consent and subject to certain limitations  allows banks to acquire out of state branches either through merger or de novo expansion 
the state of indiana enacted legislation establishing interstate branching provisions for indiana state chartered banks consistent with those established by the riegle neal act the indiana branching law 
the indiana branching law  which became effective in  authorizes indiana banks to branch interstate by merger or de novo expansion  provided that such transactions are not permitted to out of state banks unless the laws of their home states permit indiana banks to merge or establish de novo banks on a reciprocal basis 
the dodd frank act authorizes state or national banks to open de novo branches in states as long as a state bank chartered in that state could open the branch 
thus  the state s permission for such de novo branches is no longer required 
consumer financial protection bureau the dodd frank act creates a new  independent federal agency called the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb  which is granted broad rulemaking  supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws  including the equal credit opportunity act  truth in lending act  real estate settlement procedures act  fair credit reporting act  fair debt collection act  the consumer financial privacy provisions of the gramm leach bliley act and certain other statutes 
the cfpb will have examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with billion or more in assets 
smaller institutions will be subject to rules promulgated by the cfpb but will continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes 
the cfpb will have authority to prevent unfair  deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products 
the dodd frank act authorizes the cfpb to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages including a determination of the borrower s ability to repay 
in addition  the dodd frank act will allow borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure if they receive any loan other than a qualified mortgage as defined by the cfpb 
the dodd frank act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and  in certain circumstances  permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations 
federal preemption of state consumer protection law requirements  traditionally an attribute of the federal savings association charter  has also been modified by the dodd frank act and now requires a case by case determination of preemption by the occ and eliminates preemption for subsidiaries of a bank 
depending on the implementation of this revised federal preemption standard  the operations of the bank could become subject to additional compliance burdens in the states in which it operates 
mortgage reform and anti predatory lending title xiv of the dodd frank act  the mortgage reform and anti predatory lending act  includes a series of amendments to the truth in lending act with respect to mortgage loan origination standards affecting  among other things  originator compensation  minimum repayment standards and pre payments 
with respect to mortgage loan originator compensation  except in limited circumstances  an originator is prohibited from receiving compensation that varies based on the terms of the loan other than the principal amount 
the amendments to the truth in lending act also prohibit a creditor from making a residential mortgage loan unless it determines  based on verified and documented information of the consumer s financial resources  that the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan 
the amendments also prohibit certain pre payment penalties and require creditors offering a consumer a mortgage loan with a pre payment penalty to offer the consumer the option of a mortgage loan without such a penalty 
in addition  the dodd frank act expands the definition of a high cost mortgage under the truth in lending act  and imposes new requirements on high cost mortgages and new disclosure  reporting and notice requirements for residential mortgage loans  as well as new requirements with respect to escrows and appraisal practices 
interchange fees for debit cards under the dodd frank act  interchange fees for debit card transactions must be reasonable and proportional to the issuer s incremental cost incurred with respect to the transaction plus certain fraud related costs 
although institutions with total assets of less than billion are exempt from this requirement  competitive pressures are likely to require smaller depository institutions to reduce fees with respect to these debit card transactions 
transactions with affiliates the bank is subject to sections h  a and b of the federal reserve act  which limits credit transactions between a bank or savings association and its executive officers and its affiliates 
these provisions also prescribe terms and conditions deemed to be consistent with safe and sound banking practices for transactions between a financial institution and its affiliates  and restrict the types of collateral security permitted in connection with a financial institution s extension of credit to an affiliate 
federal securities law the shares of common stock of the holding company have been registered with the sec under the securities exchange act the act 
the holding company is subject to the information  proxy solicitation  insider trading restrictions and other requirements of the act and the rules of the sec thereunder 
if the holding company has fewer than shareholders  it may deregister its shares under the act and cease to be subject to the foregoing requirements 
shares of common stock held by persons who are affiliates of the holding company may not be resold without registration unless sold in accordance with the resale restrictions of rule under the securities act of if the holding company meets the current public information requirements under rule  each affiliate of the holding company who complies with the other conditions of rule including those that require the affiliate s sale to be aggregated with those of certain other persons would be able to sell in the public market  without registration  a number of shares not to exceed  in any three month period  the greater of i of the outstanding shares of the holding company or ii the average weekly volume of trading in such shares during the preceding four calendar weeks 
under the dodd frank act  beginning in  the holding company will be required to provide its shareholders an opportunity to vote on the executive compensation payable to its named executive officers and on golden parachute payments made in connection with mergers or acquisitions 
these votes will be non binding and advisory 
beginning in  the holding company must also permit shareholders to determine on an advisory basis whether such votes should be held every one  two  or three years 
sarbanes oxley act of the holding company is subject to the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act 
the sarbanes oxley act s stated goals include enhancing corporate responsibility  increasing penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and protecting investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws 
the sarbanes oxley act generally applies to all companies that file or are required to file periodic reports with the securities and exchange commission under the act 
among other things  the sarbanes oxley act creates the public company accounting oversight board as an independent body subject to sec supervision with responsibility for setting auditing  quality control and ethical standards for auditors of public companies 
the sarbanes oxley act also requires public companies to make faster and more extensive financial disclosures  requires the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of public companies to provide signed certifications as to the accuracy and completeness of financial information filed with the sec  and provides enhanced criminal and civil penalties for violations of the federal securities laws 
the sarbanes oxley act also addresses functions and responsibilities of audit committees of public companies 
the statute makes the audit committee directly responsible for the appointment  compensation and oversight of the work of the company s outside auditor  and requires the auditor to report directly to the audit committee 
the sarbanes oxley act authorizes each audit committee to engage independent counsel and other advisors  and requires a public company to provide the appropriate funding  as determined by its audit committee  to pay the company s auditors and any advisors that its audit committee retains 
the sarbanes oxley act also requires public companies to include an internal control report and assessment by management in their annual reports to stockholders 
as a small reporting company  under the dodd frank act  the holding company is not subject to any obligation to have an auditor attestation to the effectiveness of its controls included in its annual report 
although the holding company will continue to incur additional expense in complying with the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act and the resulting regulations  management does not expect that such compliance will have a material impact on the holding company s results of operations or financial condition 
community reinvestment act matters federal law requires that ratings of depository institutions under the community reinvestment act of cra be disclosed 
the disclosure includes both a four unit descriptive rating outstanding  satisfactory  needs to improve  and substantial noncompliance and a written evaluation of an institution s performance 
each fhlb is required to establish standards of community investment or service that its members must maintain for continued access to long term advances from the fhlbs 
the standards take into account a member s performance under the cra and its record of lending to first time home buyers 
the ots has designated the bank s record of meeting community credit needs as satisfactory 
predatory lending the federal reserve board issued a regulation that became effective on october  that is aimed at curbing predatory lending 
the term predatory lending encompasses a variety of practices  but the term generally is used to refer to abusive lending practices involving fraud  deception or unfairness 
predatory lending typically involves one or more of the following i making unaffordable loans based on the assets of the borrower rather than on the borrower s ability to repay an obligation asset based lending  ii inducing a borrower to refinance a loan repeatedly in order to charge high points and fees each time the loan is refinanced loan flipping  or iii engaging in fraud or deception to conceal the true nature of the loan obligation from an unsuspecting or unsophisticated borrower 
the federal reserve board amended regulation z to broaden the scope of loans subject to the protections of the home ownership and equity protection act of hoepa 
among other things  the regulation brings within the scope of hoepa first lien mortgage loans with interest rates that are at least percentage points above treasury securities having a comparable maturity 
in addition  the regulation requires that the cost of optional insurance and similar debt protection products paid by a borrower at closing be included in calculating the finance charge paid by the borrower 
hoepa coverage is triggered if such finance charges exceed percent of the total loan 
finally  the regulation restricts creditors from engaging in repeated refinancings of their own hoepa loans over a short time period when the transactions are not in the borrower s interest 
lenders that violate the rules face cancellation of loans and penalties equal to the finance charges paid 
the bank does not anticipate that these provisions  or any similar state predatory lending regulations  will materially affect its financial condition or results of operations 
usa patriot act of the usa patriot act of the patriot act is intended to strengthen the ability of us law enforcement to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts 
the patriot act contains sweeping anti money laundering and financial transparency laws and requires financial institutions to implement additional policies and procedures with respect to  or additional measures designed to address  any or all the following matters  among others money laundering  suspicious activities and currency transaction reporting  and currency crimes 
many of the provisions in the patriot act were to have expired december   but the us congress authorized renewals that extended the provisions until march  in early march  the us congress approved the usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act of the reauthorization act and the usa patriot act additional reauthorizing amendments act of the patriot act amendments  and they were signed into law by president bush on march  the reauthorization act makes permanent all but two of the provisions that had been set to expire and provides that the remaining two provisions  which relate to surveillance and the production of business records under the foreign intelligence surveillance act  will expire in four years 
the patriot act amendments include provisions allowing recipients of certain subpoenas to obtain judicial review of nondisclosure orders and clarifying the use of certain subpoenas to obtain information from libraries 
the company does not anticipate that these changes will materially affect its operations 
recent legislative developments in response to recent unprecedented financial market turmoil  the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa was enacted on october  eesa authorized the us treasury department to provide up to billion in funding for the financial services industry 
pursuant to the eesa  the treasury was initially authorized to use billion for the troubled asset relief program tarp 
of this amount  the treasury allocated billion to the tarp capital purchase program cpp 
the cpp allows financial institutions  like the holding company  to issue non voting preferred stock to the treasury in an amount ranging between and of its total risk weighted assets 
the holding company decided not to participate in the tarp cpp 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra  signed into law on february   amended the eesa as it applies to institutions that receive financial assistance under tarp 
arra  more commonly known as the economic stimulus or economic recovery package  includes a wide variety of programs intended to stimulate the economy and provide for extensive infrastructure  energy  health  and education needs 
in addition  arra imposes certain new executive compensation and corporate expenditure limits on all current and future tarp recipients until the institution has repaid the treasury 
in addition  on july   president obama signed into law the dodd frank act  which significantly changes the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry 
the dodd frank act includes provisions affecting large and small financial institutions alike  including several provisions that will profoundly affect how community banks  thrifts  and small bank and thrift holding companies  such as the holding company  will be regulated in the future 
among other things  these provisions abolish the office of thrift supervision and transfer its functions to the other federal banking agencies  relax rules regarding interstate branching  allow financial institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts  change the scope of federal deposit insurance coverage  and impose new capital requirements on bank and thrift holding companies 
the dodd frank act also establishes the bureau of consumer financial protection as an independent entity within the federal reserve  which will be given the authority to promulgate consumer protection regulations applicable to all entities offering consumer financial services or products  including banks 
additionally  the dodd frank act includes a series of provisions covering mortgage loan origination standards affecting  among other things  originator compensation  minimum repayment standards  and pre payments 
the dodd frank act contains numerous other provisions affecting financial institutions of all types  many of which may have an impact on the operating environment of the holding company in substantial and unpredictable ways 
consequently  the dodd frank act is likely to affect our cost of doing business  it may limit or expand our permissible activities  and it may affect the competitive balance within our industry and market areas 
the nature and extent of future legislative and regulatory changes affecting financial institutions  including as a result of the dodd frank act  is very unpredictable at this time 
the holding company s management is actively reviewing the provisions of the dodd frank act and assessing its probable impact on the business  financial condition  and results of operations of the holding company 
however  the ultimate effect of the dodd frank act on the financial services industry in general  and the holding company in particular  is uncertain at this time 
before and after eesa  arra  and the dodd frank act  there have been numerous actions by the federal reserve board  congress  the treasury  the fdic  the sec and others to further the economic and banking industry stabilization efforts 
it remains unclear at this time what further legislative and regulatory measures will be implemented affecting the holding company 
taxation federal taxation historically  savings associations  such as the bank  have been permitted to compute bad debt deductions using either the bank experience method or the percentage of taxable income method 
however  for years beginning after december   the bank can no longer use the percentage of taxable income method of computing its allowable tax bad debt deduction and instead must compute its allowable deduction using the experience method 
in addition  the pre reserve  for which no deferred taxes have been recorded  will not have to be recaptured into income unless i the bank no longer qualifies as a bank under the code or ii excess dividends or distributions are paid out by the bank or the bank redeems its own stock 
depending on the composition of its items of income and expense  a savings association may be subject to the alternative minimum tax 
a savings association must pay an alternative minimum tax equal to the amount if any by which of alternative minimum taxable income amti  as reduced by an exemption varying with amti  exceeds the regular tax due 
amti equals regular taxable income increased or decreased by certain tax preferences and adjustments  including depreciation deductions in excess of that allowable for alternative minimum tax purposes  tax exempt interest on most private activity bonds issued after august  reduced by any related interest expense disallowed for regular tax purposes  the amount of the bad debt reserve deduction claimed in excess of the deduction based on the experience method and of the excess of adjusted current earnings over amti before this adjustment and before any alternative tax net operating loss 
amti may be reduced only up to by net operating loss carryovers  but alternative minimum tax paid can be credited against regular tax due in later years

part ii item market for the registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 
market information and dividends there were  common shares of river valley bancorp outstanding at february   held of record by approximately shareholders 
the number of shareholders does not reflect the number of persons or entities who may hold stock in nominee or street name 
since december  the company s common shares have been listed on the nasdaq capital market formerly called the nasdaq smallcap market nasdaq  under the symbol rivr 
on december   the shares of river valley underwent a for stock split in order to create a more liquid market for the stock 
presented below are the high and low sale prices for the holding company s common shares  as well as cash distributions paid thereon since january such sales prices do not include retail financial markups  markdowns or commissions 
information relating to sales prices has been obtained from nasdaq

under ots regulations applicable to converted savings associations  river valley financial is not permitted to pay a cash dividend on its common shares if the regulatory capital of river valley financial would  as a result of the payment of such dividend  be reduced below the amount required for the liquidation account which was established for the purpose of granting a limited priority claim on the assets of river valley financial  in the event of a complete liquidation  to those members of river valley financial before the conversion who maintain a savings account at river valley financial after the conversion or applicable regulatory capital requirements prescribed by the ots 
regulations of the ots impose limitations on the payment of dividends and other capital distributions by savings associations 
because the bank is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company  it is required to file a notice with the ots days before making any capital distributions to the holding company 
it may also have to file an application for approval of a proposed capital distribution with the ots if the bank is not eligible for expedited treatment under the ots s application processing rules  or the total amount of all capital distributions  including the proposed capital distribution  for the applicable calendar year would exceed an amount equal to the bank s net earnings for that year to date plus the bank s retained net earnings for the preceding two years 
the bank must also file an application for approval of a proposed capital distribution if  following the proposed distribution  the bank would not be adequately capitalized under the ots prompt corrective action regulations  or if the proposed distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any applicable statute  regulation  or agreement between the bank and the ots or the fdic 
since the holding company has no independent operation or other subsidiaries to generate income  its ability to accumulate earnings for the payment of cash dividends to its shareholders directly depends upon the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the holding company and upon the earnings on its investment securities 
any dividend distributions by the bank to the holding company in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits will be treated for federal income tax purposes as a distribution from the bank s accumulated bad debt reserves  which could result in increased federal income tax liability for the bank 
generally  there is no ots regulatory restriction on the payment of dividends by the holding company unless there is a determination by the director of the ots that there is reasonable cause to believe that the payment of dividends constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety  soundness or stability of the bank 
the fdic also has authority under current law to prohibit a bank from paying dividends if  in its opinion  the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the bank s financial condition 
indiana law  however  would prohibit the holding company from paying a dividend  if  after giving effect to the payment of that dividend  the holding company would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or the holding company s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus preferential rights of holders of preferred stock  if any 
in november  the company issued  shares of its fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a 
for so long as any of these preferred shares remain outstanding  no dividend or distribution shall be declared or paid on the company s common stock unless all accrued and unpaid dividends on the preferred shares have been or will be first paid in full 
as discussed more comprehensively in part i  item regulation  the dodd frank act calls for the elimination of the ots as of july   subject to an additional six month extension 
the functions and rulemaking authority of the ots with respect to the bank will be transferred to the occ  and with respect to the holding company will be transferred to the federal reserve 
as a result  the limitations and restrictions imposed on the holding company and the bank with respect to dividends could change
