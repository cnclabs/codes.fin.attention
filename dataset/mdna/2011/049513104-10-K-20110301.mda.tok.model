we measure the amount of impairment of such long lived assets by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair market value of the asset  which is generally determined based on projected discounted future cash flows or appraised values 
we classify long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale as held and used until they are disposed  including assets not available for immediate sale in their present condition 
we report assets and liabilities to be disposed of by sale as held for sale and recognize those assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at the lower of carrying amount or fair value  less cost to sell 
assets classified as held for sale are not depreciated

as a result of this action  this facility was closed and all of the employees of the facility were terminated by june  in addition  we began implementing new initiatives  primarily focused on lowering manufacturing costs and eliminating non core research and development programs 
we recorded the following restructuring charges credits net charges of million related to severance costs resulting from involuntary termination of employees 
charges of million related to equipment removal and facility closure costs 
after production activity ceased  we utilized employees as well as outside services to disconnect fabrication equipment  fulfill equipment performance testing requirements of the buyer  and perform facility decontamination and other facility closure related activities 
included in these costs are labor costs  facility related costs  outside service 
table of contents provider costs  and legal and other fees 
equipment removal  building decontamination and closure related cost activities were completed as of june  charges of million related to contract termination charges  primarily associated with a long term gas supply contract for nitrogen gas utilized in semiconductor manufacturing 
in particular  we are required to pay an early termination penalty including de contamination and removal costs  as well as other contract termination costs related to semiconductor equipment support services with minimum payment clauses extending beyond the current period 
net charges of million related to changes in estimates of termination benefits originally recorded 
we paid million related to employee termination costs for the year ended december  interest and other income expense  net years ended december  december  december  in thousands interest and other income interest expense foreign exchange transaction gains losses total interest and other income expense  net  resulted in income of million for the year ended december   compared to an expense of million for the year ended december  the change to income for the year ended december  was primarily due to changes to our foreign exchange exposures from intercompany balances between our subsidiaries compared to the year ended december  we continue to have balance sheet exposures in foreign currencies subject to exchange rate fluctuations and may incur further gains or losses in the future 
included in interest expense for the year ended december  is approximately million of interest expense related to our wafer supply agreement with lfoundry 
interest expense on debt balances declined in as a result of repaying outstanding balances under our revolving line of credit and lower borrowing rates in effect for the year 
we terminated our revolving line of credit in december interest and other expense income  net  was an expense of million for the year ended december   compared to an expense of million for the year ended december  the increase in net expenses was primarily a result of a decrease in interest income of million on our investment portfolio due to lower investment yields and an increase in foreign exchange losses of million  offset by a decrease in interest expense of million due to lower debt balances 
benefit from provision for income taxes we recorded a benefit from provision for income taxes of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the significant components of the tax benefit for the year ended december  were the favorable settlement of tax audits  the release of valuation allowances attributable to deferred tax assets  as discussed below  and the recognition of certain us foreign tax credits and foreign r d credits 
for the years ended december  and  there was a benefit of million and million  respectively  due to the recognition of refundable r d credits that related to prior years 
the refundability of these credits does not depend on the existence of taxable income or a tax liability and the credits were not previously recognized due to uncertainty over the realization of these credits 
the credits were realized during these years as the income tax audits were completed or the related statutes of limitation for the credits expired 
in the year ended december   the tax benefit was partially offset by net out of period adjustments related to prior years of million to record income tax expense associated with certain foreign intercompany loans and alternative minimum tax  which related to fiscal years to we assessed the impact of correcting these 
table of contents errors in and did not believe that these amounts were material to any prior period financial statements 
as a result  we did not restate any prior period amounts 
during the fourth quarter of  we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize the benefit of a significant portion of our deferred tax assets in the future 
we based this conclusion on historical and projected operating performance  including the implementation of a global restructuring on january   such that we believe that our operations will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the tax benefit associated with the deferred tax assets 
as a result  we released valuation allowances totaling million related to certain deferred tax assets 
we believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain us federal capital loss carryforwards  state net operating losses and state tax credits  including r d credit carryforwards  will not be realized and as a result we continue to provide a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets relating to these items 
in the three months ended june   we recorded a net discrete deferred income tax benefit of million associated with the sale of our wafer manufacturing operations in rousset  france  as management determined that this benefit will more likely than not be realized in current and future periods 
the tax attribute carryforwards as at december  consist of the following in thousands december  nature of tax attribute expiration federal net operating loss carry forwards n a foreign net operating loss carry forwards  beginning state net operating loss carry forwards federal r d credits  net of those related to stock option deductions  beginning federal r d credits related to stock option deductions  beginning state r d credits  indefinite foreign tax credits  beginning state investment tax credits  beginning foreign r d credits  refundable we believe we may not be able to utilize the net operating loss carry forwards in non us jurisdictions before they expire  starting in at december   and  we had million  million and million of unrecognized tax benefits  respectively 
we recognize uncertain tax positions only to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained 
we do not expect any significant changes to uncertain tax position in the next twelve months 
during the third quarter  we were able to complete negotiations and conclude our irs audit for the years through  primarily related to transfer pricing 
as a result of the settlement of this audit  we recognized previously unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million during the year  which resulted in a benefit to tax expense of million  related to the release of previously accrued tax reserves  and an increase in gross deferred tax assets  primarily foreign tax credits and net operating losses with a full valuation allowance of million 
we also recorded an additional benefit to income tax expense of approximately million of which million related to the release of previously accrued penalties and interest on the tax exposures  and million related to a refund from the carryback of tax attributes to tax years prior to the audit 
during the fourth quarter  we recorded an income tax benefit of million related to an additional refund received related to the irs audit 
in  the french tax authority completed its examination of tax years through for one of our french subsidiaries 
the examination for these years resulted in a reduction of deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carryover of million  for which there was a full valuation allowance 
in addition  we have tax audits in progress in us states and other foreign jurisdictions 
we have accrued taxes and related interest and penalties that may be due upon the ultimate resolution of these examinations 
while we 
table of contents believe that the resolution of these tax credits will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position  the outcome is subject to significant uncertainties 
on january   we implemented a global tax restructuring 
if we had not implemented this global tax restructuring  we believe that our income tax rate and cash tax liabilities would have substantially increased in and future years due to an increase in projected taxable income  combined with the substantial reduction of tax attributes during the last few years 
this reduction of tax attributes includes the full utilization of us federal net operating losses and a substantial reduction of foreign tax credits available as of december  liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  compared to million at december  our current ratio  calculated as total current assets divided by total current liabilities  was at december   compared to at december  we reduced our debt obligations to million at december  from million at december  working capital  calculated as total current assets less total current liabilities  increased to million at december   compared to million at december  cash provided by operating activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and capital expenditures totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  increased primarily due to improved operating results  adjusting net income of million to exclude the non cash benefit relating to the release of tax accruals and reserves for certain deferred tax assets of million  offset by adjustment for certain non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million  stock based compensation charges of million  and million related to the non cash portion of loss on sale related to the sale of our rousset  france manufacturing operations and our sms business 
in addition  operating cash flows were reduced by inventory build during the year of million and trade accounts receivable increase of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was attributable to adjusting the net loss of million to exclude an asset impairment charge of million  certain non cash depreciation and amortization charges of million and stock based compensation charges of million 
in addition  operating cash flows for were increased by reduced inventories of million relating to lower production levels 
cash flows from operations were reduced by million through payments that reduced liabilities incurred in  including restructuring payments of million and a repayment of a single customer advance of million 
accounts receivable increased by or million to million at december   from million at december  the average days of accounts receivable outstanding dso decreased to days at december  from days at december  the increase in receivable balances is related to the increase in revenues during the year  while dso improved primarily due to improved collection efforts and better linearity of shipments during the year 
inventories increased during  using million of operating cash flows for the year ended december  to build inventory  compared to a decrease in inventories resulting in million of operating cash flows for the year ended december  our days of inventory increased to days at december  from days at december  inventory levels increased during the year primarily to support higher increased demand within our microcontroller business 
inventories consist of raw wafers  purchased foundry wafers  work in process and finished units 
we expect to continue to build our inventory levels throughout for the year ended december  and  we made cash payments of million and million  respectively  to former quantum employees in connection with contingent employment arrangements resulting 
table of contents from the quantum acquisition in we also received cash payments of million related to litigation related insurance settlements that were recorded as a reduction of operating expenses for the year ended december  investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we paid million for acquisitions of fixed assets and million for intangible assets  offset in part by net proceeds of million from the sale of our sms business and net proceeds of million from the sale of short term investments 
for the year ended december   we paid million for acquisitions of fixed assets  million for intangible assets and approximately million related to contingent consideration earned by a former quantum employee 
for the year ended december   we paid approximately million to acquire quantum  net of cash acquired  and million for capital expenditures  partially offset by million we received from the sale of fabrication equipment from our north tyneside  uk facility 
we anticipate expenditures for capital purchases will be between million and million in  which will be used to maintain existing manufacturing operations and provide additional testing capacity 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we repaid all remaining principal balances on our bank line of credit of million and capital leases of million for the year ended december   compared to payments of million for the year ended december  proceeds from the issuance of common stock totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we utilized million in cash to repurchase million shares of our common stock in  following the authorization by our board of directors in august to repurchase up to million of our common stock in the open market depending upon market conditions and other factors 
we believe our existing balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with anticipated cash flow from operations  available equipment lease financing  and other short term and medium term bank borrowings  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements over the next twelve months 
during the next twelve months  we expect our operations to continue to generate positive cash flow 
however  a portion of cash balances may be used to make capital expenditures  repurchase common stock  or make acquisitions 
remaining debt obligations totaled million at december  we made million in cash payments for capital equipment in  and we expect total cash payments for capital expenditures of million to million in we paid million to reduce our debt in we paid million in restructuring payments  primarily for employee severance  in we expect to pay out approximately to million in additional restructuring and disposition related payments over the next twelve months 
during and in future years  our ability to make necessary capital investments or strategic acquisitions will depend on our ability to continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and on our ability to obtain adequate financing if necessary 
we believe we have sufficient working capital to fund operations with million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  together with expected future cash flows from operations 
cash flows from operations totaled million for the year ended december  on march   we entered into a five year asset backed credit facility for up to million reduced to million on november  with certain european lenders 
commitment fees and amortization of up front fees paid related to this facility totaled million in each of the three years ended december   and  respectively  and are included in interest and other income expense  net  in the consolidated statements of operations 
in november  we repaid all amounts outstanding under this facility and terminated the facility agreement in december

e other long term obligations consist of advances from customers account for million of the balance  of which million is paid out annually  until paid in full see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the remaining balance of million relates to million of technology license payments and million of various other long term obligations 
the contractual obligation table above excludes certain estimated tax liabilities of million as of december  because we cannot make a reliable estimate of the timing of tax audit outcomes and related future tax payments 
however  these estimated tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
see note and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
our ability to service long term debt or repurchase shares in the united states or to obtain cash for other needs from our foreign subsidiaries may be structurally impeded 
since a substantial portion of our operations are conducted through our foreign subsidiaries  our cash flow  ability to service debt  and payments to vendors are partially dependent upon the liquidity and earnings of our subsidiaries as well as the distribution of those earnings  or repayment of loans or other payments of funds by those subsidiaries  to us 
our foreign subsidiaries are separate 
table of contents and distinct legal entities and may be subject to local legal or tax requirements  or other restrictions that may limit their ability to transfer funds to other group entities including the us parent entity  whether by dividends  distributions  loans or other payments 
defined benefit pension plans we sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all of our french and german employees 
plan benefits are provided in accordance with local statutory requirements 
benefits are based on years of service and employee compensation levels 
the plans are non funded  except as pension payments to beneficiaries become due 
pension liabilities and charges to expense are based upon various assumptions  updated quarterly  including discount rates  future salary increases  employee turnover  and mortality rates 
retirement plans consist of two types of plans 
our first plan type covers our french employees and provides for termination benefits paid to employees only at retirement  and consists of approximately one to five months of salary 
our second plan type covers our german employees and provides for defined benefit payouts for the remaining employee s post retirement life 
pension benefits payable under these plans totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
cash funding for benefits to be paid for in is expected to be approximately million and an additional million thereafter over the next years 
off balance sheet arrangements including guarantees in the ordinary course of business  we have investments in privately held companies  which we review annually to determine if they should be accounted for as variable interest entities 
for the year ended december   we evaluated our investments in these privately held companies and concluded that we are not the primary beneficiary of any variable interest from investment entities 
as a result  we account for these investments on the cost basis and do not consolidate the activity of these investee entities 
certain events can require a reassessment of our investments in privately held companies to determine if they meet the criteria for variable interest entities and to determine which stakeholders in such entities will be the primary beneficiary 
in the event of a reassessment  we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities in future periods 
during the ordinary course of business  we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either our subsidiaries or us 
as of december   the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately million 
we have not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements 
based on historical experience and information currently available  we believe we will not be required to make any payments under these guarantee arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance that revises analysis for identifying the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie  by replacing the previous quantitative based analysis with a framework that is based more on qualitative judgments 
the new guidance requires the primary beneficiary of a vie to be identified as the party that both i has the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact its economic performance and ii has an obligation to absorb losses or a right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie 
this guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning after november  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued guidance that expands the interim and annual disclosure requirements of fair value measurements  including the information about movement of assets between level and of the three tier fair value hierarchy established under its fair value measurement guidance 
this guidance also requires separate disclosure for purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs using level methodologies 
except for the detailed disclosure in the level reconciliation  which is effective for the fiscal years beginning after december   all the other disclosures under this guidance became effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of the disclosure portion of the guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated 
table of contents results of operations and financial position 
we do not expect the adoption of the portion of the guidance related to the level reconciliation to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of vies 
the elimination of the concept of a qspe removes the exception from applying the consolidation guidance within this amendment 
this amendment requires an enterprise to perform a qualitative analysis when determining whether or not it must consolidate a vie 
the amendment also requires an enterprise to continuously reassess whether it must consolidate a vie 
additionally  the amendment requires enhanced disclosures about an enterprise s involvement with vies and any significant change in risk exposure due to that involvement  as well as how its involvement with vies impacts the enterprise s financial statements 
finally  an enterprise will be required to disclose significant judgments and assumptions used to determine whether or not to consolidate a vie 
this amendment is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  the adoption of this amendment did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our critical accounting policies 
these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
revenue recognition we sell our products to oems and distributors and recognize revenue when the rights and risks of ownership have passed to the customer  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
allowances for sales returns and other credits are recorded at the time of sale 
contracts and customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectability based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
sales terms do not include post shipment obligations except for product warranty  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
for sales to certain distributors primarily based in the us and europe with agreements allowing for price protection and product returns  we do not have the ability to estimate future claims at the point of shipment  and given that price is not fixed or determinable at that time  revenue is not recognized until the distributor sells the product to its end customer 
during  we negotiated new sales terms with our independent distributors in asia  excluding japan 
under the new terms  we invoice these distributors at full list price upon shipment and issue a rebate  or credit  once product has been sold to the end customer and the distributor has certain met reporting requirements 
our previous sales arrangement with asia distributors was to invoice at a price net of any rebates 
we have historically recognized revenue for asia distributors at the point of shipment as the price was fixed or determinable and all other revenue recognition criteria were met at the point of shipment 
after implementing our new sales agreements  and reviewing the pricing  rebate and quotation related terms  we concluded that we could reliably estimate future claims 
therefore  we continue to recognize revenue at the point of shipment for our asian distributors  utilizing amounts invoiced  less estimated future claims  as we have the ability to estimate future claims at that time 

table of contents our revenue reporting is highly dependent on receiving accurate and timely data from our distributors 
distributors provide us periodic data regarding the product  price  quantity  and end customer when products are resold as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
because the data set is large and complex and because there may be errors in the reported data  we must use estimates and apply judgments to reconcile distributors reported inventories to their activities 
actual results could vary from those estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns we must make estimates of potential future product returns and revenue adjustments related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends in the semiconductor industry  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for sales returns 
if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates  material differences in the amount of our reported revenues may result 
we provide for sales returns based on our customer experience and our expectations for revenue adjustments based on economic conditions within the semiconductor industry 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers inability to make required payments 
we make our estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable by analyzing specific customer creditworthiness  historical bad debts and current economic trends 
at both december  and  the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million 
income taxes in calculating our income tax expense  it is necessary to make certain estimates and judgments for financial statement purposes that affect the recognition of tax assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event that we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would decrease income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would increase income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we evaluate both positive and negative evidence that may exist and consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
any adjustment to the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the consolidated statement of operations for the period that the adjustment is determined to be required 
our income tax calculations are based on application of the respective us federal  state or foreign tax law 
our tax filings  however  are subject to audit by the respective tax authorities 
accordingly  we recognize tax liabilities based upon our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more likely than not to be sustained 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
to the extent the final tax liabilities are different than the amounts originally accrued  the increases or decreases are recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of operations 
valuation of inventory our inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis for raw materials and purchased parts and an average cost basis for work in progress and finished goods or market 
cost includes labor  including stock based compensation costs  materials  depreciation and other overhead costs  as well as factors for estimated production yields and scrap 
determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments  
table of contents including average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods 
we primarily utilize selling prices in our period ending backlog for measuring any potential declines in market value below cost 
any adjustment for market value provision is charged to cost of revenues at the point of market value decline 
we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation includes analysis of historical and forecasted sales levels by product 
we provide for inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand 
in addition  we write off inventories that are considered obsolete 
obsolescence is determined from several factors  including competitiveness of product offerings  market conditions and product life cycles 
increases to the provision for excess and obsolete inventory are charged to cost of revenues 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
if this lower cost inventory is subsequently sold  the related provision is matched to the movement of related product inventory  resulting in lower costs and higher gross margins for those products 
our inventories include high technology parts that may be subject to rapid technological obsolescence and which are sold in a highly competitive industry 
if actual product demand or selling prices are less favorable than we estimate  we may be required to take additional inventory write downs 
fixed assets we review the carrying value of fixed assets for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and or disposition 
factors which could trigger an impairment review include the following i significant negative industry or economic trends  ii exiting an activity in conjunction with a restructuring of operations  iii current  historical or projected losses that demonstrated continuing losses associated with an asset  iv significant decline in our market capitalization for an extended period of time relative to net book value  v recent changes in our manufacturing model  and vi management s assessment of future manufacturing capacity requirements 
in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
the estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions  which require our judgment  including  but not limited to  future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets  future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes 
in addition  we must use our judgment in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed 
our business requires heavy investment in manufacturing facilities that are technologically advanced but can quickly become significantly underutilized or rendered obsolete by rapid changes in demand for semiconductors produced in those facilities 
we estimate the useful life of our manufacturing equipment  which is the largest component of our fixed assets  to be five years 
we base our estimate on our experience with acquiring  using and disposing of equipment over time 
depreciation expense is a major element of our manufacturing cost structure 
we begin depreciation on new equipment when it is put into use for production 
the aggregate amount of fixed assets under construction for which depreciation was not being recorded was approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets we review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
purchased intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the asset s carrying amount 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is subjective in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
we determine the fair value of our reporting unit based on an income approach  whereby we calculate the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows  which are formed by evaluating operating plans 
estimates of the future cash flows associated with the businesses are critical to these assessments 
the assumptions used in the fair 
table of contents value calculation change from year to year and include revenue growth rates  operating margins  risk adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions 
changes in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
stock based compensation we determine the fair value of stock based payment awards on the measurement date utilizing an option pricing model  which is affected by our common stock price as well as a change in assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to expected common stock price volatility over the term of the option awards  as well as the projected employee option exercise behaviors during the expected period between the stock option vesting date and the stock option exercise date 
for performance based restricted stock units  we are required to assess the probability of achieving certain financial objectives at the end of each reporting period 
based on the assessment of this probability  which requires subjective judgment  we record stock based compensation expense before the performance criteria are actually fully achieved  which may then be reversed in future periods if we determine that it is no longer probable that the objectives will be achieved 
the expected cost of each award is reflected over the performance period and is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
the fair value of a restricted stock unit is equivalent to the market price of our common stock on the measurement date 
restructuring charges we have recorded accruals for restructuring costs related to the restructuring of operations 
the restructuring accruals include primarily payments to employees for severance  termination fees associated with leases  other contracts and other costs related to the closure of facilities 
accruals are recorded when management has approved a plan to restructure operations and a liability has been incurred 
the restructuring accruals are based upon management estimates at the time they are recorded 
these estimates can change depending upon changes in facts and circumstances subsequent to the date the original liability was recorded 
litigation the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
we accrue for losses related to litigation if a loss is probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to determine whether accruals for litigation should be made 
if we were to determine that such a liability was probable and could be reasonably estimated  the adjustment would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
valuation of marketable securities our marketable securities include corporate debt securities  us government and municipal agency debt securities  commercial paper  guaranteed variable annuities and auction rate securities 
we monitor our investments for impairment periodically and recognize an impairment charge when the decline in the fair value of these investments is judged to be other than temporary 
significant judgment is used to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future use of the investment 
we consider various factors in determining whether impairment is other than temporary  including the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis  the financial condition of the issuer and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery of market value 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities whose values are dependent upon short term interest rates 
we generally classify these securities as available for sale  and consequently record them on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses being recorded as a separate part of stockholders equity 
we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
given our current profile of interest rate exposures and the maturities of our investment holdings  we believe that an unfavorable change in interest rates would not have a significant negative impact on our investment portfolio or statements of operations through december   we had long term debt and capital leases totaling million at december   which have fixed interest rates 
we no longer have any variable rate debt due to the repayment of our line of credit to bank of america in the fourth quarter of see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we do not hedge against the risk of interest rate changes for debt and could be negatively affected should these rates increase significantly 
while there can be no assurance that these rates will remain at current levels  we believe that any rate increase will not cause a significant adverse impact to our results of operations  cash flows or to our financial position 
foreign currency risk when we take an order denominated in a foreign currency we will receive fewer dollars than we initially anticipated if that local currency weakens against the dollar before we ship our product  which would reduce our revenues 
conversely  revenues will be positively impacted if the local currency strengthens against the dollar 
for example  in europe  where we have costs denominated in european currencies  costs will decrease if the local currency weakens 
conversely  all costs will increase if the local currency strengthens against the dollar 
the net effect of average exchange rates for the year ended december   compared to the average exchange rates for the year ended december   would have resulted in an increase to income of operations of million 
this impact is determined assuming that all foreign currency denominated transactions that occurred for the year ended december  were recorded using the average foreign currency exchange rates in the same period in we do not use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency risk 
changes in foreign exchange rates have historically had a significant effect on our net revenues and operating costs 
net revenues denominated in foreign currencies were  and of our total net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
costs denominated in foreign currencies were  and of our total operating costs for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net revenues denominated in euros were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
costs denominated in euros were  and of our total costs for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net revenues included million euros  million euros and million euros for the years ended december   and  respectively 
operating expenses included million euros  million euros and million euros for the years ended december   and  respectively 
average exchange rates utilized to translate foreign currency revenues and expenses in euros were approximately  and euros to the dollar for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the year ended december   changes in foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable effect on our operating results 
our net revenues for the year ended december  would have been approximately million higher had the average exchange rate in remained the same as the rate in effect for the year ended december  in addition  in  our operating expenses would have been approximately million higher relating to cost of revenues of million  research and development expenses of million and sales  general and administrative expenses of million 
the net effect  had foreign currency rates remained the same during  would have resulted in an increase to income of operations of approximately million in 
table of contents for the year ended december   changes in foreign exchange rates had a favorable effect on our operating results 
our net revenues for the year ended december  would have been approximately million higher had the average exchange rate in remained the same as the rate in effect for the year ended december  in addition  in  our operating expenses would also have been approximately million higher relating to cost of revenues of million  research and development expenses of million  and sales  general and administrative expenses of million 
the net effect  had foreign currency rates remained the same during  would have resulted in an increase to loss from operations of approximately million in we also face the risk that our accounts receivables denominated in foreign currencies will be devalued if such foreign currencies weaken quickly and significantly against the dollar 
approximately and of our accounts receivables were denominated in foreign currency as of december  and similarly  we face the risk that our accounts payable and debt obligations denominated in foreign currencies will increase if such foreign currencies strengthen quickly and significantly against the dollar 
approximately and of our accounts payable were denominated in foreign currency as of december  and  respectively 
approximately and of our debt obligations were denominated in foreign currency as of december  and december   respectively 
we have not historically sought to hedge our foreign currency exposure  although we may determine to do so in the future 
liquidity and valuation risk approximately million and million of our investment portfolio at december  and  respectively  were invested in auction rate securities 
in july  we sold million of our auction rate securities to ubs financial services inc at par value
