item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview on march   our corporation consummated the merger between intelli check and mobilisa 
the headquarters of intelli check was moved to mobilisa s offices in port townsend  washington 
mobilisa  inc was incorporated in the state of washington in march mobilisa was designated as a woman and veteran owned small business 
mobilisa s headquarters in port townsend  washington are located in a historically underutilized business zone hubzone 
mobilisa specializes in custom software development for mobile and wireless devices and wireless over water wow technology implementation and is comprised of two business units id systems and wireless technologies designed to address the following issues access control mobilisa s defense id system is designed to increase security at access points manned by law enforcement and military personnel 
marine environment communications mobilisa s wow technology allows for high speed communication between multiple points  both on land and at sea  across wide or over water expanses  and optimizes performance by making point to point systems work as point to multipoint  using intelligent routing across a dynamic network topology  and minimizing fresnel zones fresnel zones result from obstructions in the path of radio waves and impact the signal strength of radio transmissions 
mobilisa is currently developing floating area network fan technology  which allows ships within line of site to communicate with each other wirelessly at speeds faster than current  and overused  satellite communications 
in addition  our littoral sensor grid technology is being developed as the next evolutionary step in marine communications and port security 
through the use of buoys  we have created multipurpose systems with environmental and military applications that are capable of having wireless connectivity and networking capabilities  are environmental sensors data collectors and have mobile and configurable plug n play surveillance packages 
network design mobilisa s airchitect tool designs optimum wireless networks based on equipment capabilities  user requirements and physical architecture of location where the wireless is to be installed 
mobilisa also derives its revenue from selling handheld communication devices with patent pending software which allows users to send various forms of identification and compare it to information on databases 
a key component of mobilisa s business strategy is its commitment to cutting edge research and development in both id systems and advanced applications of wireless technologies 
intelli check was formed in to address a growing need for a reliable document and age verification system that could be used to detect fraudulent driver licenses and other widely accepted forms of government issued identification documents 
since then  our technology has been further developed for application in the commercial fraud protection  access control and governmental security sectors 
additionally  it is currently being used to increase productivity by addressing inefficiencies and inaccuracies associated with manual data entry 
the core of intellicheck s product offerings is our proprietary software technology that verifies the authenticity of driver licenses and state issued non driver and military identification cards used as proof of identity 
our patented id check software technology instantly reads  analyzes  and verifies the encoded format in magnetic stripes and barcodes on government issued ids from over jurisdictions in the us and canada to determine if the encoded format is valid 
we have served as the national testing laboratory for the aamva since because of continuing terrorist threats worldwide  we believe there has been a significant increase in awareness of our software technology to help improve security across many industries  including airlines  rail transportation and high profile buildings and infrastructure  which we believe may enhance future demand for our technology 
the adaptation of homeland security presidential directive hspd and the promulgation of federal identity processing standards have raised the awareness of our technology in the government sector 
therefore  we have begun to market to various government and state agencies  which have long sales cycles  including extended test periods 
in view of the acquisition of mobilisa and evolving nature of our business and our operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of revenues and operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
by verifying the encoded format  our id check patented technology provides the ability to verify the validity of military ids  driver licenses and state issued non driver id cards that contain magnetic stripes  bar codes smart chips  and radio frequency id technologies  which enables us to target three distinct sectors 
our original target sector was focused on resellers of age restricted products  such as alcohol and tobacco  where the proliferation of high tech fake ids exposes merchants to fines and penalties for the inadvertent sale of these products to underage purchasers 
we now also target commercial fraud  which includes identity theft  and our technology is designed to help prevent losses from these frauds 
we are also marketing our products for security applications involving access control 
as a result of its applicability in these sectors  we have sold our products to some of the largest companies in the gaming industry  significant retailers  several large financial service companies and military facilities 
our technology is currently being used or tested by several fortune companies 
we have a strategic alliance with verifone  the largest provider of credit card terminals in the us  several system integrators in the defense industry and hardware manufacturers to utilize our systems and software as the proposed or potential verification application for their proposed solutions for credentialing in the government sector and to jointly market these security applications 
recent department of homeland security initiatives  along with the regulations arising from hspd  which sets the policy for a common identification standard for federal employees and contractors  and the new transportation worker identity credential or twic card  which is currently required for all sea port workers  have additionally created opportunities for our verification technology in the governmental sector at the federal  state and local levels 
in addition  we have executed agreements with some high profile organizations to promote the use of our technology and our products 
we believe these relationships have broadened our marketing reach through their sales efforts and we intend to develop additional strategic alliances with additional high profile organizations and providers of security solutions 
we have developed additional software products that take advantage of our patented software technology 
our products include id check pos  id check bho  scaninntm and assurescantm 
id check pos is the technology that has been integrated into multiple verifone platforms such as the xx series to enable the user to do verification of the encoded format on driver licenses as an additional function of the terminal 
id check bho is a browser helper object that enables a customer to add the id check technology as a plug in to internet explorer pages without requiring software programming expertise 
scaninn is a software application that speeds up check in and id verification at hotels and motels 
assurescan is an application that assists pharmacies with id verification and tracking related drug purchases 
additional software solutions include id check pc and id check mobile  which replicate the features of id check 
another application is c link  the company s networkable data management software 
additionally  id check pc and c link are designed to read the smart chip contained on the military common access card cac 
these products  which run on a personal computer  were created to work in conjunction with our id check technology and allow a user to first verify the encoded format and then view the encoded data for further verification 
our id check mobile product gives the user the additional flexibility of utilizing our software in a hand held product 
to date  we have entered into multiple licensing agreements and are in discussions with additional companies to license our software to be utilized within other existing systems 
we also have created the im  or mobile twic reader  for use with the department of homeland security s new twic card 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the company s financial statements and accompanying notes 
significant estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements include impairment of goodwill  valuation of intangible assets  deferred tax valuation allowances  allowance for doubtful accounts and the fair value of stock options granted under the company s stock based compensation plans 
due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making estimates  actual results reported in future periods may be different from those estimates 
we believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and the more significant areas involving management judgments and estimates 
these significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  stock based compensation  deferred taxes and commitments and contingencies 
these policies and our procedures related to these policies are described in detail below 
valuation of goodwill and other long lived assets our long lived assets include property and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill 
as of december   the balances of property and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill  all net of accumulated depreciation and amortization  were   and  respectively 
as of december   the balances of property and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill  all net of accumulated depreciation and amortization  were   and  respectively 
we depreciate property and equipment and amortize intangible assets that have finite lives over their estimated useful lives 
for purposes of determining whether there are any impairment losses  as further discussed below  management evaluates the carrying amounts of identifiable long lived tangible and intangible assets  including their estimated useful lives  when indicators of impairment are present as more fully described below 
based on our review of the carrying amounts of the long lived tangible and intangible assets with finite lives  we may also determine that shorter estimated useful lives are appropriate 
in that event  we record depreciation and amortization over shorter future periods  which would reduce our earnings 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations 
pursuant to asc topic  the company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter  or between annual tests  in certain circumstances  such as the occurrence of operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the asset 
the company evaluates goodwill for impairment using the two step process 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  a second step must be followed to calculate impairment 
the company performs the initial step by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value of the reporting units  which is determined by considering future discounted cash flows  market transactions and multiples  among other factors 
intangible assets acquired intangible assets include trade names  patents  developed technology and backlog described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company uses the straight line method to amortize these assets over their estimated useful lives 
the company reviews its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable in accordance with asc topic to determine recoverability of its long lived assets  the company evaluates the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows  without interest charges  will be less than the carrying amount of the assets 
impairment is measured at fair value 
the date of our annual goodwill impairment test is december each year 
as of december  and  we determined that no impairment had taken place 
factors we generally consider important and which could trigger an impairment review of the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill include the following significant changes in the manner of use of assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and significant decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value 
although we believe that the remaining recorded amounts of our long lived tangible and intangible assets and goodwill were realizable as of december   future events could cause us to conclude otherwise 
if our stock price were to decrease for a sustained period of time we may be required to assess the carrying amount of goodwill and long lived assets of our reporting units before our scheduled annual impairment test 
if at that time the estimated fair values of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying amounts  we would need to determine whether our goodwill and long lived assets would be impaired 
moreover  if economic conditions continue to deteriorate and capital markets conditions continue to adversely impact the valuation of enterprises  the estimated fair values of our reporting units could be adversely impacted  which could result in future impairments 
purchase price allocations of acquired businesses valuations of acquired businesses require us to make significant estimates  which are derived from information obtained from the management of acquired businesses  our business plans for the acquired business or intellectual property and other sources 
critical assumptions and estimates used in the initial valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets include  but are not limited to assessments of appropriate valuation methodologies in the circumstances  future expected cash flows from product sales  customer contracts and acquired developed technologies  patents and other intellectual property  expected costs to complete any in process research and development projects and commercialize viable products and estimated cash flows from sales of such products  the acquired companies brand awareness and industry position  assumptions about the period of time over which we will continue to use the acquired brand and intangible assets  and discount rates 
the estimates and assumptions may not materialize because unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
if estimates and assumptions used to initially value goodwill and intangible assets prove to be different from actual results  ongoing reviews of the carrying values of such goodwill and intangible assets may indicate impairment  which will require us to record an impairment charge in the period in which it is identified 
revenue recognition and deferred revenue revenue is generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable  collectability is probable  and there is no future company involvement or commitment 
the company sells its commercial products directly through its sales force and through distributors 
revenue from directsales of our products is recognized when shipped to the customer and title has passed 
the company recognizes sales from licensing of its patented software to customers 
the company s licensed software requires continuing service or post contract customer support and performance  accordingly  a portion of the revenue is deferred based on its fair value and recognized ratably over the period in which the future service  support and performance are provided  which is generally one to three years 
royalties from the licensing of the company s technology are recognized as revenues in the period they are earned 
we receive revenue from research and development contracts 
these contracts are generally with government agencies under long term cost plus fixed fee contracts  where revenue is based on time and material costs incurred 
revenue from these arrangements is recognized as time is spent on the contract and materials are purchased 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
the company also performs consulting work for other companies 
these services are billed based on time and materials 
revenue from these arrangements is also recognized as time is spent on the contract and materials are purchased 
subscriptions to database information can be purchased for month to month  one  two  and three year periods 
revenue from subscriptions are deferred and recognized over the contractual period  which is typically three years 
the company offers enhanced extended warranties for its sales of hardware and software at a set price 
the revenue from these sales are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual period  which is typically one to three years 
under the provisions of asc topic  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  revenue arrangements were allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values and revenue is recognized in accordance with its policy as stated above 
stock based compensation the company accounts for the issuance of equity awards to employees in accordance with asc topic and  which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
this pronouncement establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share based payment arrangements and requires all companies to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for all share based payment transactions with employees 
deferred income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and net operating loss carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using expected tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets as of december   due to the uncertainty of the realizability of those assets 
commitments and contingencies we are not currently involved in any legal or regulatory proceeding  or arbitration  the outcome of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on our business 
certain legal proceedings were settled during which are further discussed in item  above 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the acquisition of positive access was completed on august   and therefore positive access s results of operations are included in the financial statements beginning from september  revenue 
total revenues were approximately lower in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  year ended december  change identity systems wireless r d the increase in the identity systems revenues in is primarily a result of higher sales in the commercial sector as well as higher software engineering fees to customers in the financial sector 
the decrease in wireless r d revenues is primarily due to the completion of our radhaz military contract in and the reallocation of our software engineering resources to identity systems projects 
total booked orders were million in compared to million in as of december   our backlog  which represents non cancelable sales orders for products not yet shipped and services to be performed  was approximately million compared to million at december  the decrease is primarily a result of million in billings on the fan buoy r d contract during previously  the company recorded in backlog certain wireless r d contracts when the award was announced and included in the congressional budget with the company named as the requestor 
during  congress announced that earmarks awarded to public companies are now subject to competition  even when the government had previously determined that a sole source justification was the best option 
therefore  we will now be competing for the fy earmark for littoral sensor grid 
as a result  the company removed million from the previously disclosed million backlog at december   resulting in a restated backlog of million 
the entire backlog is expected to be realized over the next twelve to fifteen months 
period to period comparisons may not be indicative of future operating results  since we still face long sales cycles  particularly in the government sector  and  therefore  we cannot predict with certainty in which period the opportunities currently in the pipeline will develop into sales or if they will develop at all 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased by  or to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  our gross profit  as a percentage of revenues  remained at in both the years ended december  and operating expenses 
operating expenses  which consist of selling  general and administrative and research and development expensesincreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  consolidated selling expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   principally as a result of an increase in personnel 
general and administrative expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   principally due to cost of the move of the new york offices  increased payroll costs  contracted consulting fees to the former positive access principals  legal fees related to litigation and shelf registration statement  additional board and consulting fees and higher intangible amortization 
research and development expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   principally a result of increases in personnel 
the company completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with asc topic goodwill and other intangible assets and asc topic accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
based upon this review  it was determined that there was no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as of december  interest income 
interest income was insignificant in both periods presented 
interest expense 
interest expense of  in represents the interest and amortization of deferred debt discount on the notes payable to the former principals of positive access 
income taxes 
we have incurred net losses to date  therefore  we have paid nominal income taxes 
net loss 
as a result of the factors noted above  we incurred a net loss of  for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the acquisition of mobilisa was completed on march   and therefore mobilisa s results of operation are included in the financial statements for the period march  through december  the acquisition of positive access was completed on august   and therefore positive access s results of operations are included in the financial statements beginning from september  revenue 
revenues increased by  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  as reported year ended december  pro forma year ended december  change change identity systems wireless r d the increase in the identity systems revenues in is primarily a result of a large sale to a telecommunications company  including an enterprise wide software license 
the wireless r d contract revenue increased primarily due to the continued development in the fan and buoy projects 
total booked orders were million in compared to million in as of december   our backlog  which represents non cancelable sales orders for products not shipped and services not yet performed  was approximately million compared to million at december  gross profit 
gross profit increased by  or from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  our gross profit  as a percentage of revenues  increased to in the year ended december  compared to the reported for the year ended december  the gross profit percentage increase in was principally a result of a reduction in merger related intangible amortization costs which amounted to  in compared to  in we took an intangible asset impairment charge the end of resulting in lower merger amortization costs going forward 
operating expenses 
excluding the goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges in  operating expenses  which consist of selling  general and administrative and research and development expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  approximately  of the increase in expenses in is because mobilisa operating expenses were included for a period of months in the period 
in addition  during we increased expenses in support of increased revenue growth and shareholder value 
during  we added three additional salespersons and paid higher commissions resulting from higher sales levels 
we also increased our shareholder relations expenses  including the hiring of a new investor relations firm 
as we experience sales growth  we expect that we will incur additional operating expenses to support this growth 
research and development expenses may also increase as we integrate additional products and technologies with our patented id check technology and enter into additional research and development contracts 
the company completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with asc topic goodwill and other intangible assets and asc topic accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
based upon this review  it was determined that there was no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as of december  however  as a result of a substantial decrease in the market price of the company common stock  reflecting the very difficult overall market conditions in the latter half of  the company reassessed the carrying value of its goodwill and intangible assets as of december  and concluded that both of these were impaired 
the company recorded non cash impairment charges to goodwill and intangible assets of  in the fourth quarter of related to the mobilisa reporting unit 
interest income 
interest income decreased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december   which is a result of a decrease in our average invested cash and cash equivalents  as well as lower interest rates received on investments during due to continued uncertainties in the financial markets  we continued to invest our excess cash in highly liquid bank and government insured money market accounts  with low yields in interest expense 
interest expense of  in represents the amortization of deferred debt discount on the notes payable to the former principals of positive access 
income taxes 
we have incurred net losses to date  therefore  we have paid nominal income taxes 
net loss 
excluding the impact of the non cash goodwill and intangible assets impairment charge  as a result of the factors noted above  our net loss decreased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  total net loss for  after the impairment charge  was  liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  working capital defined as current assets minus current liabilities of  total assets of  and stockholders equity of  during  the company decreased its cash and cash equivalents by  of this amount  approximately million was used in for non repeating items including acquisition matters  moving of office facilities and litigation costs 
the primary use of the remaining cash was to fund working capitaland to develop programs to generate increased sales 
cash used in operating activities was  in compared to cash provided by operating activities of  in the increase in the use of cash in is primarily due to funding the net loss in as well as for increased working capital requirements  including higher accounts receivable due to significant sales at the end of the fourth quarter 
we used cash of  in investing activities in compared to  in the reduction in the use of cash for the period is a result of increased capital expenditures for leasehold improvements and equipment purchases  while the period included the initial cash paid for the purchase of positive access corporation 
cash used in financing activities was  in compared to cash provided of  in in  scheduled repayments of  were made to former positive access principals as part of the original purchase price  which was partially offset by  of higherproceeds from the exercise of stock options in compared to at year end  the company s excess cash was invested in money market funds 
these investments  totaling  have been classified as cash equivalents as of december  the company s investing strategy is to continue to invest in short term liquid investments with emphasis on fdic and sipc insured protection 
the company s mobilisa subsidiary previously had a  revolving line of credit with bank of america 
during  the company decided not to renew the facility 
while there is no tax expense recorded in the results of operations in all periods presented  we made an income tax payment of approximately  in in settlement of the pre merger taxable liability of mobilisa 
we currently anticipate that our available cash on hand and cash equivalents  as well as expected cash from future operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capitals and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
we keep the option open to raise additional funds to respond to business contingencies which may include the need to fund more rapid expansion  fund additional marketing expenditures  develop new markets for our technology  enhance our operating infrastructure  respond to competitive pressures  or acquire complementary businesses or necessary technologies 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to secure the additional funds when needed or obtain such on terms satisfactory to the company  if at all 
the company has filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission sec  which became effective july  under the shelf registration statement  the company may offer and sell  from time to time in the future in one or more public offerings  its common stock  preferred stock  warrants  and units 
the aggregate initial offering price of all securities sold by the company will not exceed  and  pursuant to sec rules  the company may only sell up to one third of the market cap held by non affiliate stockholders in any month period 
the specific terms of any future offering  including the prices and use of proceeds  will be determined at the time of any such offering and will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement which will be filed with the sec at the time of the offering 
in addition  the shelf registration statement provides that certain selling stockholders may offer  from time to time  up to  shares of intellicheck mobilisa  inc common stock in the aggregate 
the shelf registration statement is designed to give the company the flexibility to access additional capital at some point in the future when market conditions are appropriate 
we are not currently involved in any legal or regulatory proceeding  or arbitration  the outcome of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on our business 
adjusted ebitda the company uses adjusted ebitda as a non gaap financial performance measurement 
adjusted ebitda is calculated by adding back to net loss interest  income taxes  impairments of long lived assets and goodwill  depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation expense 
adjusted ebitda is provided to investors to supplement the results of operations reported in accordance with gaap 
management believes that adjusted ebitda provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing intellicheck mobilisa financial results with other companies that also use adjusted ebitda in their communications to investors 
by excluding non cash charges such as impairments of long lived assets and goodwill  amortization  depreciation and stock based compensation  as well as non operating charges for interest and income taxes  investors can evaluate the company operations and can compare its results on a more consistent basis to the results of other companies 
in addition  adjusted ebitda is one of the primary measures management uses to monitor and evaluate financial and operating results 
intellicheck mobilisa considers adjusted ebitda to be an important indicator of the company operational strength and performance of its business and a useful measure of the company historical operating trends 
however  there are significant limitations to the use of adjusted ebitda since it excludes interest income and expense  impairments of long lived assets and goodwill  stock based compensation expense  all of which impact the company profitability  as well as depreciation and amortization related to the use of long term assets which benefit multiple periods 
the company believes that these limitations are compensated by providing adjusted ebitda only with gaap net loss and clearly identifying the difference between the two measures 
consequently  adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net loss presented in accordance with gaap 
adjusted ebitda as defined by the company may not be comparable with similarly named measures provided by other entities 
a reconciliation of gaap net loss to adjusted ebitda follows year ended december  unaudited net loss reconciling items interest net benefit provision for income taxes depreciation and amortization stock based compensation costs impairments of long lived assets and goodwill adjusted ebitda related party transactions mobilisa leases office space from a company lessor company that is wholly owned by two directors  who are members of management

the lessor company entire operations consist of the leased property and related bank debt 
the company is a guarantor of the loans for the leased property 
as of december   the company maximum exposure to loss is  under asc topic  amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r  companies are required to consolidate a related variable interest entity vie when the reporting company is the primary beneficiary of that entity and holds a variable interest in the vie 
the determination of whether a reporting company is the primary beneficiary of a vie ultimately turns on whether the reporting entity will absorb a majority of the vie anticipated losses or receive a majority of the vie anticipated gains 
the company analyzed its transactions with and relationship to the lessor company and concluded that it had an implicit variable interest in the lessor company 
however  the primary beneficiary  based on an assessment of what entity absorbs a majority of the entity expected losses  receives a majority of its expected residual returns  or both  as a result of holding variable interests  are the common owners 
accordingly  the company is not required to consolidate the operations of the lessor company 
net operating loss carry forwards as of december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards nols for federal income tax purposes of approximately million 
there can be no assurance that the company will realize the benefit of the nols 
the federal nols are available to offset future taxable income and expire from to if not utilized 
the company has not yet completed its review to determine whether or not these nols will be limited under section of the internal revenue code due to the ownership change from the acquisition of mobilisa  inc contractual obligations below is a table  which presents our contractual obligations and commitments at december  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years operating leases consulting agreements purchase obligations total contractual cash obligation recently issued accounting pronouncements except as discussed below  the company does not expect the impact of the future adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued guidance included in asc topic  interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
this update requires fair value disclosures for financial instruments that are not currently reflected on the balance sheet at fair value on a quarterly basis and was effective for interim periods ended after june  the company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  accrued expenses and notes payable 
at december  and the carrying value of the companies financial instruments approximated fair value  due to their short term nature 
the carrying value of the long term portion of the notes payable approximated fair value based on market interest rate applied 
in june  the fasb issued guidance included in asc topic  amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r 
this updated guidance requires a qualitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity vie  and requires ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a vie and whether an interest in a vie makes the holder the primary beneficiary of the vie 
this guidance became effective for the company on january  and did not have a material impact on the results of operations and financial condition 
in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this asu establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements including multiple revenue generating activities 
this asu provides amendments to the criteria for separating deliverables  measuring and allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting 
the amendments in this asu also establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
significantly enhanced disclosures are also required to provide information about a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  including information about the nature and terms  significant deliverables  and its performance within arrangements 
the amendments also require providing information about the significant judgments made and changes to those judgments and about how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
the amendments in this asu are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in the fiscal years beginning on or after june  early application is permitted 
the company is currently evaluating this new asu 
in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
this asu changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements that are essential to the functionality  and scopes these products out of current software revenue guidance 
the new guidance will include factors to help companies determine what software elements are considered essential to the functionality 
the amendments will now subject software enabled products to other revenue guidance and disclosure requirements  such as guidance surrounding revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the amendments in this asu are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in the fiscal years beginning on or after june  early application is permitted 
the company is currently evaluating this new asu 
in january  the fasb issued asu no 
 improving disclosures about fair value measurements  that amends existing disclosure requirements under asc by adding required disclosures about items transferring into and out of levels and in the fair value hierarchy  adding separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements relative to level measurements  and clarifying  among other things  the existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation 
for the company  this asu was effective beginning january   except for the requirement to provide level activity of purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis  which is effective beginning january  since this standard impacts disclosure requirements only  its adoption will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
in march  the fasb ratified a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force that recognizes the milestone method as an acceptable revenue recognition method for substantive milestones in research or development arrangements 
this consensus would require its provisions be met in order for an entity to recognize consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a substantive milestone as revenue in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
in addition  this consensus would require disclosure of certain information with respect to arrangements that contain milestones 
this issue is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years beginning after june  the company is currently evaluating the impact of this consensus on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition
