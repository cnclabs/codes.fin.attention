item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our industry according to the may  idc report  worldwide and us outsourced customer care services forecast reckoning with the aftermath of a credit bubble  the global crm market  which idc refers to as the worldwide customer care services market  totaled over billion in and is expected to grow to over billion by idc estimates that the span of years from will reflect a compound annual growth rate of for this market 
the contact center outsourcing industry is highly fragmented and competitive  with the largest company representing approximately of the market according to frost sullivan 
despite the increasingly competitive 
table of contents nature of the market  we believe outsourcing will continue to grow as a result of higher client demand for cost savings along with the need for high quality customer interactions and innovative service solutions that deliver real value 
stream also believes the desire for companies to focus on core competencies remains strong and will continue to drive them to outsource certain non core functions to experienced outsourcing providers with the appropriate global scale  processes and technological expertise 
moreover  we believe that the current economic slowdown has increased demand for outsourcing because it offers an incremental channel to increase sales 
as business becomes more global  many companies find they do not possess sufficient capacity or the optimal infrastructure  international experience or technology tools to service their customers 
therefore  they increasingly look to global bpo service providers like stream that have invested in technology and infrastructure and have established a global presence to deliver customer facing services in both established and emerging markets 
the largest crm and bpo customers are typically multinational companies that require their service providers to have a global footprint in order to service segments of their customer base in multiple countries and multiple languages  and also be agile enough to scale quickly as volume requirements change 
in essence  our global clients require i global servicing capabilities to fit the needs of particular products or programs in multiple languages  ii a sophisticated technology infrastructure that enables fully integrated customer interaction channels that are analytics enabled and virtually accessible across a global delivery platform  iii a solution driven approach that solves multiple customer needs  such as total customer experience  retention and lower customer churn rates  and creates new or expanded revenue opportunities for our clients  and iv a competitive total cost of solution that takes advantage of technology  applications  defined processes and a diverse global operation 
our strategy our strategy is to be a leading provider of integrated  global crm and bpo services that allow our clients to create maximum value for their customers over the long term 
in order to achieve this strategy  we intend to offer a broad suite of services that leverages an integrated technology platform on a global basis 
we expect to increase our revenues and profitability while further growing our market position by implementing our global business strategy  which includes  among other things  the following key elements expand organic revenue growth 
we expect to increase our revenue through a combination of winning business from new clients and increasing our service offerings and market share for existing clients 
we expect to continue to win new clients in the future as more companies outsource their crm and bpo services 
additionally  many of our clients are consolidating their crm and bpo relationships to vendors who can provide multiple service offerings on a global basis 
we expect to capitalize on this trend by increasing our service offerings for existing clients and winning a greater share of services that they currently outsource 
we also expect to generate new business by working with our clients to outsource non core programs that are currently managed internally 
enhance margins through global expansion and operating efficiency 
we seek to enhance our gross and operating margins by improving our systems and infrastructure and by expanding our global operations 
we also continue to work to improve our operating metrics  such as utilization and productivity  employee retention  and workforce management  and take advantage of advanced technology tools  such as voice over internet protocol voip  virtualization of the desktop and server  learning and development platforms and standardized global processes to increase accessibility and quality of information and data exchange 
we also believe that we will continue to improve our margins by continuing to expand our global presence in lower cost high quality off shore locations 

table of contents expand our revenue growth and market share through targeted acquisitions

we believe relations with our employees are good 
competition the industry in which we operate is competitive and highly fragmented 
our competitors range in size from very small firms offering specialized applications or short term projects  to large independent firms  and the in house operations of many clients and potential clients

table of contents item a 
risk factors our business is subject to numerous risks 
the risk factors listed below include any material changes to and supersede the description of the risk factors associated with our business previously disclosed in item a of our quarterly report on form q for the fiscal quarter ended march  and in item a of our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  the risk factors that appear below  among others  could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the securities and exchange commission  press releases  communications with investors and oral statements 
such forward looking statements are discussed under cautionary note regarding forward looking statements 
risks relating to our business we have a history of losses and there can be no assurance that we will become or remain profitable or that losses will not continue to occur 
for the year ended december   we had a net loss of million 
we may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
our ability to achieve profitability will depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain an adequate client base  effectively manage a large global business  react to changes  including technological changes  in the markets we target or operate in  deploy our services in additional markets or industry segments  continue to maintain operating efficiencies in our service centers across the globe  respond to competitive developments and challenges  attract and retain experienced and talented personnel  and establish strategic business relationships 
we may not be able to do any of these successfully  and our failure to do so is likely to have a negative impact on our operating results 
a substantial portion of our revenue is generated from a limited number of clients  and the loss of one or more of these clients or a decline in end user acceptance of our client s products would materially reduce our revenue and cash flow and adversely affect our business 
we have derived  and we believe that we will continue to derive a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of clients 
revenue from our two largest clients  dell inc and the hewlett packard company  accounted for and  respectively  of our revenues for the year ended december  although we generally enter into multi year contracts with clients  most of which are typically renewable  these contracts generally do not require clients to provide a minimum amount of revenues and allow clients to terminate earlier for convenience 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain  renew or extend our contracts with our major clients 
although some of these contracts require the client to pay a contractually agreed upon amount in the event of early termination  there can be no assurance that we will be able to collect such amount or that such amount  if received  will sufficiently compensate us for any significant investment we may have made to support the cancelled program or for the revenues we may lose as a result of the early termination 
there can also be no assurance that if we were to lose one or more of our major clients  we would be able to replace such clients with new clients that generate a comparable amount of revenues 
a number of factors could cause us to lose business or revenue from a client  and some of these factors are not predictable and are beyond our control 
for example  a client may demand price reductions  change its outsourcing strategy  move work 
table of contents in house or reduce previously forecasted demand 
in addition  the volume of work we perform for specific clients may vary from year to year 
in most cases  if a client terminates its contract with us or does not meet its forecasted demand  we would have no contractual recourse even if we have built out facilities and or hired and trained service professionals to provide services to the client 
thus  a major client in one year may not provide the same level of revenue in any subsequent year 
consequently  the loss of one or more of our major clients  or the inability to generate anticipated revenues from them  would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
our operating results for the foreseeable future will continue to depend on our ability to effect sales to a small number of clients and any revenue growth will depend on our success selling additional services to our large clients and expanding our client base 
we typically charge our clients based on the number of inbound calls that we service  or the amount of time  by the minute or by the hour  that our service professionals spend with end users relating to our clients products 
we also provide inbound and outbound sales services to our clients  whereby we are paid based on our level of sales success and other client driven metrics 
to the extent there is a decline in spending for our clients products  whether as a result of a decline in product acceptance or general economic conditions  our business will be adversely affected 
there are a number of factors relating to discretionary consumer and business spending  including economic conditions affecting disposable income such as employment  business conditions  taxation and interest rates which impact the ability of our clients to sell their products  and most of which are outside of our control 
there can be no assurance that spending for our clients products will not be affected by adverse economic conditions  thereby affecting our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
our revenue is highly dependent on a few industries and any decrease in demand for outsourced business processes in these industries could reduce our revenue and seriously harm our business 
most of our revenue is derived from clients concentrated in the computing hardware and telecommunications service providers industries 
the success of our business largely depends on continued demand for our services from clients in these industries  as well as on trends in these industries to outsource business processes on a global basis 
a downturn in any of the industries we serve  a slowdown or reversal of the trend to outsource business processes in any of these industries or the introduction of regulations that restrict or discourage companies from outsourcing  could result in a decrease in the demand for our services  which in turn could materially harm our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
despite recent signs of economic recovery in some markets  many of the markets in which we operate are still in an economic downturn that we believe has had and will continue to have a negative effect on the business of many of our clients  which has  in some cases  resulted in lower volumes of work for us 
in the event that the global economy slips back into a recession or the economic downturn in some of the markets in which we serve worsens  we may experience even lower volumes and pricing pressures  which would negatively affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
other developments may also lead to a decline in the demand for our services in the industries we serve 
consolidation in any of the industries that we serve  particularly involving our clients  may decrease the potential number of buyers of our services 
furthermore  many of our existing and new clients have begun or plan to consolidate or reduce the number of service providers that they use for various services in various geographies 
to the extent that we are not successful in becoming the recipient of the consolidation of services by these clients our business and revenues will suffer 
any significant reduction in  or the elimination of  the use of the services we provide within any of these industries would reduce our revenue and cause our profitability to decline 
we may be unable to successfully execute on any of our identified business opportunities or other business opportunities that we determine to pursue 
in order to pursue business opportunities  we will need to continue to build our infrastructure  our client initiatives and operational capabilities 
our ability to do any of these successfully could be affected by one or more of the following factors the ability of our technology and hardware  suppliers and service providers to perform as we expect  
table of contents our ability to execute our strategy and continue to operate a large  more diverse business efficiently on a global basis  our ability to effectively manage our third party relationships  our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  our ability to effectively manage our employee costs and other expenses  our ability to retain and grow our clients and the current portfolio of business with each client  technology and application failures and outages  security breaches or interruption of service  which could adversely affect our reputation and our relations with our clients  our ability to accurately predict and respond to the rapid technological changes in our industry and the evolving service and pricing demands of the markets we serve  and our ability to raise additional capital to fund our growth 
our failure to adequately address the above factors would have a significant impact on our ability to implement our business plan and our ability to pursue other opportunities that arise  which might negatively affect our business 
our business may be impacted by the performance of our clients 
our revenue and call volume is often highly correlated with units sold  renewals from our clients customers or end users  and revenue of our clients 
our clients may experience rapid changes in their prospects  substantial price competition and pressure on their results of operations  which may result in lower volumes and or pressure on us to lower our prices 
in addition  many of our clients are seeking to consolidate their current group of service providers to a smaller more manageable group that is able to provide integrated service offerings on a global basis 
in some cases we do not currently offer or have service locations in those geographic locations where our clients are seeking services 
our ability to sustain growth and profitability in the current environment is very dependent upon our ability to maintain and or gain a greater share of business within our current clients and attract new clients 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future 
in the event that some of our service centers do not receive sufficient call volume in the future  we may be required to close them and relocate business in other centers 
this would require substantial employee severance  lease termination costs and other re organization costs 
moreover  we are exposed to additional risks related to our clients ability to pay and the resulting non collectability of our accounts receivables 
in the event that our clients prospects deteriorate or the availability of credit tightens  our clients liquidity may be adversely impacted  resulting in delayed or reduced payments to us 
such delays or reductions in payment or the non payment by our clients of amounts owed to us may require us to incur a bad debt expense 
in the event that one of our major clients should file for bankruptcy protection or otherwise fail  our future business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
we may not be able to achieve incremental revenue growth or profitability 
our strategy calls for us to achieve incremental revenue growth and profitability through initiatives  such as opening new or expanding our existing internationally located service locations in places like china 
other initiatives we may pursue include  i the addition or expansion of services  such as sales and warranty services  ii the introduction of front end technology driven service solutions for fee based services  self help  and other technology driven solutions  and iii operational improvements in areas such as employee attrition  site capacity utilization  centralization of certain administrative services  productivity rates and use of technology 
we are also in process of consolidating and rationalizing certain of our service facilities and legacy administrative offices to 
table of contents improve our profitability 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties or delays in implementing these initiatives  and any such difficulties or delays would adversely affect our future operating results and financial performance 
we have  on a consolidated basis  a substantial amount of debt  which could impact our ability to obtain future financing or pursue our growth strategy 
we have substantial indebtedness 
as of december   we had approximately million of indebtedness including capital leases and up to an additional million of borrowings available under the abl credit facility  before taking into account outstanding letters of credit  subject to borrowing base limitations and other specified terms and conditions 
our high level of indebtedness could have important consequences and significant adverse effects on our business  including the following we must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness  which will reduce the funds available to us for operations and other purposes  our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired  our high level of indebtedness could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have proportionately less debt  our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate may be limited  our high level of indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business  and our ability to fund a change of control offer may be limited 
the instruments governing our abl credit facility contain  and the instruments governing any indebtedness we may incur in the future may contain  restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best interests 
our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of our outstanding indebtedness 
payments on our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to meet our cash requirements and service our debt is impacted by many factors that are outside of our control 
we expect to obtain the funds to pay our expenses and to pay the amounts due under the notes primarily from our operations and borrowings under our abl credit facility 
our ability to meet our expenses and make these payments thus depends on our future performance  which will be affected by financial  business  economic and other factors  many of which we cannot control 
our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future and our currently anticipated growth in revenue and cash flow may not be realized  either or both of which could result in our being unable to repay indebtedness  including the notes  or to fund other liquidity needs 
our ability to borrow amounts under our abl credit facility will be subject to borrowing base limitations and other specified terms and conditions  and the ability of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to borrow amounts under our abl credit facility in the future is also subject  among other conditions  to our provision of security interests in certain assets of those foreign subsidiaries  which we did not provide upon the closing of the abl credit facility and we may not be able to provide in the future 
if we do not have sufficient cash resources in the future  we may be required to refinance all or part of our then existing debt  sell assets or borrow more money 
we might not be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on terms acceptable to us or at all 
in addition  the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives 
our failure to generate sufficient cash flow or to achieve any of these alternatives could materially adversely affect the value of the notes and our ability to pay the amounts due under the notes 

table of contents we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness that could further exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness 
we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
although the indenture governing the notes and the loan agreement governing our abl credit facility contain restrictions on our incurrence of additional debt  these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions that permit us to incur substantial additional indebtedness  including additional secured indebtedness 
if we incur additional debt  the risks described above under we have  on a consolidated basis  a substantial amount of debt  which could impact our ability to obtain future financing or pursue our growth strategy and payments on our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to meet our cash requirements and service our debt is impacted by many factors that are outside of our control would intensify 
our business may not develop in ways that we currently anticipate due to negative public reaction to outsourcing and recently proposed legislation 
we have based our growth strategy on certain assumptions regarding our industry  services and future demand in the market for our services 
however  the trend to outsource business processes may not continue and could reverse 
outsourcing is a politically sensitive topic in the united states and elsewhere due to a perceived association between outsourcing providers and the loss of jobs in the united states 
a variety of us federal and state legislation has been proposed that  if enacted  could restrict or discourage us companies from outsourcing services outside the united states 
for example  public figures  such as president obama  have supported legislation that they contend will generate new jobs in the united states  including limiting income tax benefits for companies that offshore american jobs 
because most of our clients are us companies headquartered in the united states  any expansion of existing laws or the enactment of new legislation restricting offshore outsourcing could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
it is possible that legislation could be adopted that would restrict us private sector companies that have federal or state government contracts from outsourcing their services to off shore service providers 
this would also negatively affect our ability to attract or retain clients that have these contracts 
in addition  many jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislation relating to the protection of sensitive customer data or other consumer protections that has resulted or may result in increases in our operational expenses 
current or prospective clients may elect to perform such services themselves or may be discouraged from transferring their services from onshore to off shore providers as a result of the perceived diminishment of operational efficiencies or cost savings 
any slowdown or reversal of existing industry trends towards off shore outsourcing would seriously harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that operate solely out of facilities located in the united states or canada 
we may be unable to cost effectively attract and retain qualified personnel  which could materially increase our costs 
our business is dependent on our ability to attract  retain and motivate key executives and also recruit  hire  train and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel  including individuals with significant experience in the industries that we have targeted 
the crm and bpo service industry is labor intensive and is normally characterized by high monthly employee turnover 
any increase in our employee turnover rate would increase our recruiting and training costs  decrease our operating effectiveness and productivity and delay or deter us from taking on additional business resulting in lower financial performance 
also  the introduction of significant new clients or the implementation of new large scale programs may require us to recruit  hire and train personnel at an accelerated rate 
in addition  some of our facilities are located in geographic areas with relatively low unemployment rates  thus potentially making it more difficult and costly to attract and retain qualified personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to hire  train and retain sufficient qualified personnel to adequately staff our business 

table of contents we may not be able to predict our future tax liabilities 
if we become subject to increased levels of taxation or if tax contingencies are resolved adversely  our results of operations and financial performance could be adversely affected 
due to the international nature of our operations  we are subject to the complex and varying tax laws and rules of several foreign jurisdictions 
we may not be able to predict the amount of future tax liabilities to which we may become subject due to some of these complexities if our positions are challenged by local tax authorities 
any increase in the amount of taxation incurred as a result of challenges to our tax filing positions or due to legislative or regulatory changes could result in a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are subject to tax audits  including issues related to transfer pricing  in the united states and other jurisdictions 
we have material tax related contingent liabilities that are difficult to predict or quantify 
while we believe that our current tax provisions are reasonable and appropriate  we cannot be assured that these items will be settled for the amounts accrued or that additional exposures will not be identified in the future or that additional tax reserves will not be provided for any such exposures 
our financial results may be impacted by significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
a substantial amount of our operating costs is incurred in foreign currencies 
in many cases  we bill our clients in us dollar  canadian dollar  euro and uk pound sterling denominated amounts and incur costs in the host country in local currency 
if the us dollar drops in value relative to other currencies  our cost of providing services outside the united states will increase accordingly when measured in us dollars 
in addition  a substantial amount of our revenue is denominated in foreign currencies 
if the us dollar increases in value relative to other currencies  the value of those revenues will decrease accordingly when measured in us dollars 
any continued significant fluctuations in the currency exchange rates between the us dollar  canadian dollar  euro and us pounds sterling and the currencies of countries in which we operate may affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
a substantial portion of our costs are incurred and paid in philippine pesos 
therefore  we are exposed to the risk of an increase in the value of the philippine peso relative to the us dollar  which would increase the value of those expenses when measured in us dollars 
in addition  a significant amount of our revenue is denominated in euro 
therefore  we are exposed to the risk of an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro  which would decrease the value of those revenues accordingly when measured in us dollars 
although we engage in hedging relating to the canadian dollar  the indian rupee and the philippine peso  our hedging strategy may not sufficiently protect us from further strengthening of these currencies against the us dollar 
as a result  our expenses could increase and harm our operating results 
in the converse  if the us dollar strengthens against the canadian dollar  the indian rupee or the philippine peso  our hedging strategy could reduce the potential benefits we would otherwise expect from a strengthening us dollar 
we are also doing business in latin america but do not yet hedge currencies from these countries 
our international operations and sales subject us to additional risks  including risks associated with unexpected events 
we conduct business in various countries outside of the united states  including canada  the netherlands  the united kingdom  italy  ireland  spain  sweden  france  germany  poland  denmark  bulgaria  india  the philippines  el salvador  egypt  tunisia  south africa  nicaragua  the dominican republic and costa rica 
a key component of our growth strategy is our entry into new markets or expansion of our existing markets  such as china 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully market  sell and deliver our services in these markets  or that we will be able to successfully expand our international operations 
the global reach of our business could cause us to be subject to unexpected  uncontrollable and rapidly changing events and circumstances 
the following factors  among others  could adversely affect our business and earnings failure to properly comply with foreign laws and regulations applicable to our foreign activities including  without limitation  employment law requirements  
table of contents compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting regulations in the countries where we operate now and in the future  including employment laws  intellectual property requirements  and the foreign corrupt practices act and other anti corruption laws  difficulties in managing foreign operations and attracting and retaining appropriate levels of senior management and staffing  longer cash collection cycles  seasonal reductions in business activities  particularly throughout europe  proper compliance with local tax laws which can be complex and may result in unintended adverse tax consequences  anti american sentiment due to american policies that may be unpopular in certain countries  difficulties in enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems  fluctuations in exchange rates that may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in us dollars of services we provide in foreign markets  where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency and revenues are earned in us dollars or other currency  changes in general economic conditions or political strife or upheaval in countries where we operate  the ability to efficiently repatriate cash to the united states and transfer cash between foreign jurisdictions  changes in transfer pricing policies for income tax purposes in countries where we operate  restrictions on downsizing operations and personnel in europe and other jurisdictions ie regulatory or works council restrictions and expenses and delays associated with any such activities  and changes to or elimination of the international tax holiday for our subsidiaries in india or the philippines 
as we continue to expand our business globally  our success will depend  in large part  on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations 
our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our global operations and reduce our global sales  adversely affecting our business and future financial performance 
countries where we do business have recently experienced political and economic instability and civil unrest and terrorism  which has and may continue to disrupt our operations and may cause our business to suffer 
certain countries where we do business  particularly egypt and tunisia  and less recently the philippines  india  and certain latin american countries  have experienced or are experiencing civil unrest  terrorism and political turmoil  resulting in temporary work stoppages and telecommunication or other technology outages 
if such civil unrest or political turmoil increases or such operational disruptions become prolonged  our existing and potential new clients may hesitate to keep or move their business into such locations 
in addition  we expect to enter into new markets in places such as china which may have similar risks 
these conditions could disrupt our operations and cause our business to suffer 
moreover  countries where we do business  and in particular the philippines  have experienced significant inflation  currency declines and shortages of foreign exchange 
we are exposed to the risk of cost increases due to inflation in the philippines  which has historically been at a much higher rate than in the united states 
current tax holidays in the philippines will expire within the next two years 
we currently benefit from income tax holiday incentives in the philippines pursuant to the registrations with the philippine economic zone authority  or peza  of our various projects and operations 
under such peza 
table of contents registrations  the income tax holiday of our various peza registered projects in the philippines expire at staggered dates through the expiration of these tax holidays will increase our effective income tax rate 
our revenues and costs are subject to quarterly variations that may adversely affect quarterly financial results 
we have experienced  and in the future could experience  quarterly variations in revenues as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control  including the timing of new client contracts  the timing of new service offerings or modifications in client strategies  our ability to attract and retain and increase sales to existing customers  the timing of acquisitions of businesses and products by us and our competitors  our ability to effectively build and start up new solution centers  product and price competition  our ability to build an integrated service offering on a common technology platform  changes in our operating expenses  software defects or other product quality problems  the ability to implement new technologies on a timely basis  the expiration or termination of existing contracts  the timing of increased expenses incurred to obtain and support new business  currency fluctuations  and changes in our revenue mix among our various service offerings 
in addition  our planned staffing levels  investments and other operating expenditures are based on revenue forecasts provided by our clients 
if actual revenues are below these forecasts or our own expectations in any given quarter  our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows would likely be materially adversely affected for that quarter and thereafter 
in addition  to the extent that we enter into mergers and acquisitions or new business ventures in the future  our quarterly or future results may be impacted 
our financial results may be adversely affected by increases in labor related costs 
because a significant portion of our operating costs relate to labor costs  an increase in us or foreign wages  costs of employee benefits or taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
for example  over the past several years  healthcare costs have increased at a rate much greater than that of general cost or price indices 
increases in our pricing may not fully compensate us for increases in labor and other costs incurred in providing services 
some of our facilities are located in jurisdictions  such as france  italy and germany  where it is difficult or expensive to temporarily or permanently lay off hourly workers due to both local laws and practices within these jurisdictions 
such laws will make it more expensive for us to respond to adverse economic conditions 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase our pricing or reduce our workforce to fully compensate for the increases in the costs to provide services 
we may need to increase the levels of employee compensation more rapidly than in the past to remain competitive in attracting and retaining the quality and number of employees that our business requires 
wage costs in india  the philippines and other offshore locations have historically been significantly lower than wage costs in the north america and europe for comparably skilled professionals  which has been one of stream s 
table of contents competitive advantages 
however  because of rapid economic growth in india and the philippines  increased demand for crm and bpo services and increased competition for skilled employees in offshore low cost locations like india and the philippines  wages for comparably skilled employees in such locations are increasing at a faster rate than in north america and europe  which may reduce this competitive advantage 
as additional outsourcing companies enter the market and expand their operations  we expect competition for skilled employees at the service professional and middle and upper management levels to increase which would affect the availability and the cost of our employees and increase our attrition rate 
wage increases in the long term may reduce our profit margins 
additionally  because substantially all of our employees based outside the united states are paid in local currency  while our revenues are collected in other currencies primarily in us dollars  the euro and uk pounds sterling  our employee costs as a percentage of revenues may increase or decrease significantly if the exchange rates between these currencies fluctuate significantly 
we have not experienced significant union activity or organized labor activity in the past 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience increased union organizing activity in the future 
such organization could increase our cost of labor  limit our ability to modify work schedules and cause work stoppage 
our profitability will be adversely affected if we do not maintain sufficient capacity utilization 
our profitability is influenced significantly by the capacity utilization of our service centers 
because a majority of our business consists of inbound contacts from end users  we have no control of when or how many end user customer contacts are made 
moreover  we have significantly higher utilization during peak week day periods than during off peak night and weekend periods and therefore we need to reserve capacity at our service centers to anticipate peak periods 
in the future  we may consolidate or close under performing service centers in order to maintain or improve targeted utilization and margins 
if we close service centers in the future due to insufficient customer demand  we may be required to record restructuring or impairment charges  which could adversely impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain optimal service center capacity utilization 
many of our existing or emerging competitors are better established and have significantly greater resources  which may make it difficult to attract and retain clients and grow revenues 
the market in which we compete is highly competitive and fragmented 
we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future 
our competitors include small firms offering specific applications  divisions of large entities  large independent firms and  most significantly  the in house operations of clients or potential clients 
because we compete with the in house operations of existing or potential clients  our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected if our existing clients decide to provide crm and other bpo solutions that currently are outsourced or if potential clients retain or increase their in house customer service and product support capabilities 
in addition  competitive pressures from current or future competitors or in house operations could cause our services to lose market acceptance or result in significant price erosion  which would have a material adverse effect upon our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
some of our clients may in the future seek to consolidate services that we provide  which may in turn reduce the amount of work we perform for them 
some of our existing and future competitors have greater financial  human and other resources  longer operating histories  greater technological expertise  more recognizable brand names and more established relationships than we do in the industries that we currently serve or may serve in the future 
some of our competitors may enter into merger  strategic or commercial relationships among themselves or with larger  more established companies in order to increase their ability to address client needs 
increased competition  pricing pressure or loss of market share could reduce our operating margin  which could harm our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 

table of contents we may engage in future acquisitions that could disrupt our business  cause dilution to our stockholders and harm our financial position and operating results 
we may pursue acquisitions of companies or assets in order to enhance our market position and or expand the types of services that we offer to our clients and may enter geographic markets where we do not currently conduct business 
we may also acquire minority interest in companies or enter into joint venture arrangements with other parties  which may include existing clients 
we may also pursue certain acquisitions on an unsolicited basis  which may cause management distractions and increased legal costs 
we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to consummate such acquisitions on favorable terms  if at all 
if we do complete acquisitions  we cannot be sure that they will ultimately strengthen our competitive position  or that our clients  employees or investors will not view them negatively 
acquisitions may disrupt our ongoing operations  divert management from day to day responsibilities  increase our indebtedness  liabilities  exposure to different legal regimes and or regulations  and expenses and harm our operating results or financial condition 
we may not be able to successfully integrate these acquisitions into our operations and may lose key clients  employees  members of management or not achieve the synergies and other benefits expected from the acquisition or investment 
future acquisitions may reduce our cash available for operations and other uses and could result in an increase in amortization expense  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt  which could harm our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
our business depends on uninterrupted service to our clients 
a system failure or labor shortage could cause delays or interruptions of service  which could cause us to lose clients 
our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our service centers  computer and telecommunications equipment and software systems against damage or interruption from fire  power loss  telecommunications interruption or failure  natural disaster  breaches in data and technology security integrity and other similar events in order to provide our clients with reliable services 
additionally  we depend on our employees to perform our services on behalf of our clients 
if we are unable to staff our service centers due to labor shortages  or employees miss work due to labor strikes or civil or political unrest  natural disasters and other similar events  our ability to provide our clients with reliable services will be hindered 
some of the events that could adversely affect our ability to deliver reliable service include physical damage to our network operations centers  disruptions  power surges or outages to our computer and telecommunications technologies which are beyond our control  sabotage or terrorist attacks and cyber attacks or data theft  software defects  fire or natural disasters such as typhoons  hurricanes  floods and earthquakes  civil unrest and political turmoil  and labor shortages or walk outs 
technology is a critical foundation in our service delivery 
we utilize and deploy internally developed and third party software solutions that is often customized by us across various hardware and software environments 
we operate an extensive internal voice and data network that links our global sites together in a multi hub model that enables the rerouting of call volumes 
we also rely on multiple public communication channels for connectivity to our clients 
maintenance of and investment in these foundational components are critical to our success 
if the reliability of technology or network operations fall below required service levels  or a systemic fault affects the organization broadly  business from our existing and potential clients may be jeopardized and cause our revenue to decrease 
if we experience a temporary or permanent interruption at one or more of our service centers and or data centers  through casualty  operating malfunction  labor shortage or otherwise  our business could be materially adversely affected and we may be required to pay contractual damages to affected clients or allow some clients to terminate or renegotiate their contracts with us 
although we maintain property  business interruption and general liability insurance  including coverage for errors and omissions  there can be no assurance that our existing coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in amounts sufficient to cover one or more large claims  or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim 
the occurrence of errors could result in a loss of data to us or our clients  which could cause a loss of revenues  failure to achieve 
table of contents product acceptance  increased insurance costs  product returns  legal claims  including product liability claims  against us  delays in payment to us by clients  increased service and warranty expenses or financial concessions  diversion of resources  injury to our reputation  or damages to our efforts to build brand awareness  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our market share and  in turn  our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we are subject to us and foreign jurisdiction laws relating to individually identifiable information  and failure to comply with those laws  whether or not inadvertent  could subject us to legal actions and negatively impact our operations 
we process  transmit and store information relating to identifiable individuals  both in our role as a service provider and as an employer 
as a result  we are subject to numerous us both federal and state and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations  such as the us health insurance portability and accountability act and the european union data protection directive ec  governing the protection and processing of individually identifiable information  including social security numbers  financial and health information 
failure to comply with these types of laws may subject us to  among other things  liability for monetary damages  fines and or criminal prosecution  unfavorable publicity  restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations  any of which may have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow 
unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential data could expose us to protracted and costly litigation and penalties and may cause us to lose clients 
we are dependent on information technology networks and systems to process  transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations and with our partners and clients 
security breaches of this infrastructure could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information 
we are also required at times to manage  utilize  record and store sensitive or confidential data 
as a result  we are subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations designed to protect this information 
if any person  including any of our employees  negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data  we could be subject to monetary damages  fines and or criminal prosecution 
unauthorized disclosure or recording of sensitive or confidential client or customer data  whether through system failure  employee negligence  fraud or misappropriation  could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients 
similarly  unauthorized access to or through our information systems  whether by our employees or third parties  could result in negative publicity  legal liability and damage to our reputation  business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we have a long selling cycle for our crm and bpo services that requires significant funds and management resources and a long implementation cycle that requires significant resource commitments 
we have a long selling cycle for our crm and bpo services for new clients  which requires significant investment of capital  resources and time by both our clients and us 
typically  before committing to use our services  potential clients require us to expend substantial time and resources educating them as to the value of our services and assessing the feasibility of integrating our systems and processes with theirs 
our clients then evaluate our services before deciding whether to use them 
therefore  our selling cycle  which generally ranges from six to twelve months  is subject to many risks and delays over which we have little or no control  including our clients decision to choose alternatives to our services such as other providers or in house offshore resources and the timing of our clients budget cycles and approval processes 
in addition  we may not be able to successfully conclude a contract after the selling cycle is complete 
implementing our services involves a significant commitment of resources over an extended period of time from both our clients and us 
our clients may also experience delays in obtaining internal approvals or delays 
table of contents associated with technology or system implementations  thereby delaying further the implementation process 
our clients and future clients may not be willing or able to invest the time and resources necessary to implement our services  and we may fail to close sales with potential clients to which we have devoted significant time and resources  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
once we are engaged by a client  it may take us several months before we start to recognize significant revenues 
when we are engaged by a client after the selling process for our crm and bpo services  it takes from four to six weeks to integrate the client s systems with ours and up to three months thereafter to ramp up our services and staff levels  including hiring and training qualified service professionals and technicians  to the client s requirements 
depending on the complexity of the processes being implemented  these time periods may be significantly longer 
implementing processes can be subject to potential delays similar to certain of those affecting the selling cycle 
therefore  we do not recognize significant revenues until after we have completed the implementation phase 
if we are unable to adjust our pricing terms or the mix of products and services we provide to meet the changing demands of our crm and bpo clients and potential crm and bpo clients  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
industry pricing models are evolving  and we anticipate that clients may increasingly request transaction based pricing 
this pricing model will place additional pressure on the efficiency of our service delivery so that we can maintain reasonable operating margins 
if we are unable to adapt our operations to evolving pricing protocols  our results of operations may be adversely affected or we may not be able to offer pricing that is attractive relative to our competitors 
in addition  the crm and bpo services we provide to our clients  and the revenues and income from those services  may decline or vary as the type and quantity of services we provide under those contracts changes over time  including as a result of a shift in the mix of products and services we provide 
furthermore  our clients  some of which have experienced rapid changes in their prospects  substantial price competition and pressures on their profitability  have in the past and may in the future demand price reductions  automate some or all of their processes or change their outsourcing strategy by moving more work in house or to other providers  any of which could reduce our profitability 
any significant reduction in or the elimination of the use of the services we provide to any of our clients  or any requirement to lower our prices  would harm our business 
we depend on third party technology that  if it should become unavailable  contain defects  or infringe on another party s intellectual property rights  could result in increased costs or delays in the production and improvement of our products or result in liability claims 
we license critical third party technology that we incorporate into our services on a non exclusive basis 
we customize the third party software in many cases to our specific needs and content requirements 
while we monitor our usage of third party technology and our compliance with our licenses to use such technology  we may inadvertently violate the terms of our license agreements  which could subject us to liability  including the termination of our rights to use such software or the imposition of additional license fees 
if our relations with any of these third party technology providers become impaired  or if the cost of licensing any of these third party technologies increases  our gross margin levels could significantly decrease and our business could be harmed 
the operation of our business would also be impaired if errors occur in the third party software that we utilize or the third party software infringes upon another party s intellectual property rights 
it may be more difficult for us to correct any defects or viruses in third party software because the software is not within our control 
if we are unable to correct such errors  our business could be adversely affected 
there can be no 
table of contents assurance that these third parties will continue to invest the appropriate resources in their products and services to maintain and enhance the capabilities of their software 
in addition  although we try to limit our exposure to potential claims and liabilities arising from third party infringement claims arising out of  and errors  defects or viruses in  such third party software  in the license agreements that we enter into with such third party software providers  such provisions may not effectively protect us against such claims in all cases and in all jurisdictions 
if we are unable to keep pace with technological changes  our business will be harmed 
our business is highly dependent on our computer and telecommunications equipment  infrastructure and software capabilities 
our failure to maintain the competitiveness of our technological capabilities or to respond effectively to technological changes could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our continued growth and future profitability will be highly dependent on a number of factors  including our ability to expand our existing solutions offerings  achieve cost efficiencies in our existing service center operations  introduce new solutions that leverage and respond to changing technological developments  and remain current with technology advances 
there can be no assurance that technologies  applications or services developed by our competitors or vendors will not render our products or services non competitive or obsolete  that we can successfully develop and market any new services or products  that any such new services or products will be commercially successful or that the integration of automated customer support capabilities will achieve intended cost reductions 
in addition  the inability of equipment vendors and service providers to supply equipment and services on a timely basis could harm our operations and financial condition 
defects or errors within our software could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
design defects or software errors may delay software introductions or reduce the satisfaction level of clients and may have a materially adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our software is highly complex and may  from time to time  contain design defects or software errors that may be difficult to detect and or correct 
since both our clients and we use our software to perform critical business functions  design defects  software errors or other potential problems within or outside of our control may arise from the use of our software 
it may also result in financial or other damages to our clients  for which we may be held responsible 
although our license agreements with our clients often contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential claims and liabilities arising from client problems  these provisions may not effectively protect us against such claims in all cases and in all jurisdictions 
claims and liabilities arising from client problems could result in monetary damages to us and could cause damage to our reputation  adversely affecting our business and results of operations 
failure to comply with internal control attestation requirements could lead to loss of public confidence in our financial statements 
any future acquisitions and other material changes in our operations likely will require us to expand and possibly revise our disclosure controls and procedures  internal controls over our financial reporting and related corporate governance policies 
in addition  the sarbanes oxley act of and associated regulations relating to effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity and  as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies 
if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations differ from the conduct intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities or varying interpretations of the law  we could be subject to regulatory sanctions  the public may lose confidence in our internal controls and the reliability of our financial statements  and our reputation may be harmed 

table of contents the industries in which we operate are continually evolving 
our services may become obsolete  and we may not be able to develop competitive services on a timely basis or at all 
the crm and bpo service industry is characterized by rapid technological change  competitive pricing  frequent new service introductions and evolving industry standards 
the success of our company will depend on our ability to anticipate and adapt to these challenges and to offer competitive services on a timely basis 
we face a number of difficulties and uncertainties associated with this reliance on technological development  such as competition from service providers using other means to deliver similar or alternative services  realizing economies of scale on a global basis  responding successfully to advances in competing technologies and network security in a timely and cost effective manner  and existing  proposed or undeveloped technologies that may render our services less profitable or obsolete 
if we fail to manage future growth effectively  we may be unable to execute our business plan  maintain high levels of service or address competitive challenges adequately 
we plan to expand our business 
we anticipate that this expansion will require substantial management effort and significant additional investment in infrastructure  service offerings and service center expansion 
in addition  we will be required to continue to improve our operational  financial and management controls and our reporting procedures 
future growth of our company will place a significant strain on managerial  administrative  operational  financial and other resources 
if we are unable to manage growth successfully  our business will be harmed 
government regulation of our industry and the industries we serve may increase our costs and restrict the operation and growth of our business 
both the us federal and various state governments regulate our business and the outsourced business services industry as a whole 
the federal telemarketing and consumer fraud and abuse prevention act of broadly authorizes the federal trade commission ftc to issue regulations restricting certain telemarketing practices and prohibiting misrepresentations in telephone sales 
the ftc regulations implementing this act are commonly referred to as the telemarketing sales rule 
our operations outside the united states are also subject to regulation 
in addition to current laws  rules and regulations that regulate our business  bills are frequently introduced in congress to regulate the use of credit information 
we cannot predict whether additional federal or state legislation that regulates our business will be enacted 
additional federal or state legislation could limit our activities or increase our cost of doing business  which could cause our operating results to suffer 
we could be subject to a variety of regulatory enforcement or private actions for our failure or the failure of our clients to comply with these regulations 
our results of operations could be adversely impacted if the effect of government regulation of the industries we serve is to reduce the demand for our services or expose us to potential liability 
we may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us 
we are currently  and from time to time in the future we may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business  including patent  software  commercial  product liability  employment  class action  whistleblower and other litigation and claims  and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings 
such matters can be time consuming  divert management s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses 
furthermore  because litigation is inherently unpredictable  there can be no assurance that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents an outbreak of a pandemic  flu or other disease  or the threat of a pandemic  flu or other disease  may adversely impact our ability to perform our services or may adversely impact client and consumer demand 
we have a large number of employees across the world in many different countries with different levels of healthcare monitoring 
most of these employees work in relatively close proximity to each other in our service centers 
a significant or widespread outbreak of a pandemic  such as the flu or other contagious illness  or even a perceived threat of such an outbreak  could cause significant disruptions to our employee base and could adversely impact our ability to provide our services and deliver our products 
this could have a significant impact on our business and our results of operations 
risks related to our equity securities there can be no assurance that nyse amex will continue to list our securities on its exchange  and any delisting could limit investors ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions 
our units  common stock and warrants are listed on nyse amex  a national securities exchange 
we cannot assure you that our securities will continue to be listed on nyse amex in the future 
if nyse amex delists our securities from trading on its exchange and we are unable to list our securities on another exchange  our securities could be quoted on the otc bulletin board  or pink sheets 
as a result  we could face significant adverse consequences  including but not limited to the following a limited availability of market quotations for our securities  a determination that our common stock is a penny stock which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities  a reduced liquidity for our securities  a decreased ability to obtain new financing or issue new securities on favorable terms in the future  a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future  and a decreased ability of our security holders to sell their securities in certain states 
the value of our units  common stock and warrants may be adversely affected by market volatility 
the market price of our units  shares and warrants has been highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
in addition  our financial sponsors hold a large percentage of our outstanding shares  which are subject to certain restrictions on resale  and our relatively low trading volume causes significant price variations to occur 
if the market prices of our units  shares and warrants decline significantly  you may be unable to resell your units  shares and warrants at or above your purchase price  if at all 
we cannot assure you that the market price of our units  shares and warrants will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future 
some of the factors that could negatively affect the price of our units  shares and warrants or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our units  shares and warrants include significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of comparable companies  actual or anticipated changes in our earnings or fluctuations in our operating results or in the expectations of securities analysts  the exercise of participation rights held by certain of our stockholders in connection with the exercise of our warrants  announcements of technological innovations  new products  strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors  
table of contents general economic conditions and trends  catastrophic events  or recruitment or departure of key personnel 
the control that our financial sponsors have over us and provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law might limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions  including a change in control  and  therefore  depress the trading price of our common stock 
our financial sponsors  ares corporate opportunities fund ii  lp  newbridge international investment ltd 
and egs dutchco bv  collectively own approximately of our common stock and are parties to a stockholders agreement that restricts our ability to undertake certain actions 
therefore  our financial sponsors collectively are able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval  are able to cause or prevent a change of control of our company or a change in the composition of our board of directors  and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of our company 
the market price of our shares could be adversely affected to the extent that this concentration of ownership and stockholders agreement  as well as provisions of our organizational documents  discourage or impede potential takeover attempts that our other stockholders may favor 
furthermore  our financial sponsors may  in the future  own businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us 
our financial sponsors may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business  and as a result  those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us 
provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law may also discourage  delay or prevent a merger  acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable  including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our common stock 
these provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management 
for example  our organizational documents require advance notice for proposals by stockholders and nominations  place limitations on convening stockholder meetings and authorize the issuance of preferred shares that could be issued by our board of directors to thwart a takeover attempt 
moreover  certain provisions of delaware law may delay or prevent a transaction that could cause a change in our control 
our outstanding warrants have been  and in the future may be  exercised and trigger the exercise of certain participation rights held by our major stockholders  which have increased  and in the future would increase  the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our stockholders 
this might have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
as of december    publicly traded warrants were outstanding  including  shares of common stock underlying warrants embedded in our units 
to the extent that additional warrants are exercised  additional shares of our common stock will be issued  which will result in further dilution to our stockholders and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market 
in addition  the exercise of any of our publicly traded warrants triggers contractual participation rights for ares  newbridge and dutchco collectively  the participating stockholders  pursuant to which they would have the right to purchase from us additional shares of common stock at per share for each of our publicly traded warrants that are exercised  up to a maximum of approximately  shares  which will cause further dilution to our stockholders 
in addition  sales in the public market of substantial numbers of shares acquired through either the exercise of these participation rights or the exercise of these warrants could adversely affect the market price of our shares 
we do not expect to pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 
you should not rely on an investment in our common stock to provide dividend income 
we do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future 
instead  we plan to retain any earnings to maintain and expand our existing operations 
in addition  we are restricted from paying dividends in certain circumstances under the terms of the indenture governing our notes and the abl 
table of contents credit facility 
accordingly  investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation  which may never occur  as the only way to realize any return on their investment 
as a result  investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock 
we may choose to redeem our outstanding warrants at a time that is disadvantageous to our warrant holders 
we may redeem the warrants issued as a part of our publicly traded units at any time in whole and not in part  at a price of per warrant  upon a minimum of days prior written notice of redemption  if and only if  the last sales price of our common stock equals or exceeds per share for any trading days within a trading day period ending three business days before we send the notice of redemption 
redemption of the warrants could force the warrant holders to exercise the warrants and pay the exercise price therefore at a time when it may be disadvantageous for the holders to do so  to sell the warrants at the then current market price when they might otherwise wish to hold the warrants or to accept the nominal redemption price which  at the time the warrants are called for redemption  is likely to be substantially less than the market value of the warrants

table of contents critical accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates including those related to derivatives and hedging activities  income taxes including the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  valuation of long lived assets  self insurance reserves  litigation and restructuring liabilities  and allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
equipment and fixtures equipment and fixtures are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
furniture and fixtures are generally depreciated over a five year life  software over a three to five year life and equipment generally over a three to five year life 
leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the remaining term of the associated lease 
assets held under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease 
amortization expense is computed using the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the period of the related lease and is recorded in depreciation and amortization expense 
repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
the carrying value of equipment and fixtures to be held and used is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with authoritative guidance 
an asset is considered to be impaired when the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition does not exceed its carrying amount 
the amount of the impairment loss  if any  is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value  which is generally determined based on appraisals or sales prices of comparable assets 
occasionally  we redeploy equipment and fixtures from underutilized centers to other locations to improve capacity utilization 
we estimate fair value of our asset retirement obligations  if any  associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets such as property and equipment when the long lived asset is acquired  constructed  developed or through normal operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the authoritative guidance goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate that an asset might be impaired 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
the impairment  if any  is measured based on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
we operate in one reporting unit  which is the basis for impairment testing of all goodwill 
intangible assets with a finite life are recorded at cost and amortized using their projected cash flows over their estimated useful life 
client lists and relationships are amortized over periods up to ten years  market adjustments related to facility leases are amortized over the term of the respective lease and developed software is amortized over five years 
brands and trademarks are not amortized as their life is indefinite 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance  indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate that an asset might be impaired 
the carrying value of finite lived intangibles is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with the authoritative 
table of contents guidance 
an asset is considered to be impaired when the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition does not exceed its carrying amount 
the amount of the impairment loss  if any  is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value  which is generally determined based on appraisals or sales prices of comparable assets 
stock based compensation for share based payments  the fair value of each grant under our stock based compensation plan for employees and directors  including both the time based grants and the performance based grants  is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option valuation model 
stock compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting term  net of an estimated future forfeiture rate 
income taxes we recognize income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance  which requires recognition of deferred assets and liabilities for the future income tax consequence of transactions that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes  and the amounts used for income tax  using the enacted tax rates for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we provide valuation allowances against deferred tax assets whenever we believe it is more likely than not  based on available evidence  that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
further we provide for the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements and the impact of a tax position in the financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained by the taxing authority 
contingencies we consider the likelihood of various loss contingencies  including non income tax and legal contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business  and our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued in accordance with the authoritative guidance  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
the guidance requires new disclosures on the transfers of assets and liabilities between level quoted prices in active market for identical assets or liabilities and level significant other observable inputs of the fair value measurement hierarchy  including the reasons and the timing of the transfers 
additionally  the guidance requires a roll forward of activities on purchases  sales  issuance  and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs level fair value measurements 
the guidance became effective for us with the reporting period beginning january   except for the requirement to separately disclose purchases  sales  issuances and settlements of recurring level fair value measurements which is effective january  other than requiring additional disclosures  adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued guidance on revenue recognition that will become effective for us beginning january   with earlier adoption permitted 
under the new guidance  when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for multi element deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined  a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
the new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
we believe adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements

in the us  where we operated at a loss for tax purposes  we recorded million income tax expense for the year ended december  primarily related to the finalization of purchase accounting 
we operate in a number of countries outside the us that are generally taxed at lower statutory rates than the us and also benefit from tax holidays 
liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs are for financing working capital associated with the expenses we incur in performing services under our client contracts and capital expenditures for the opening of new service centers  including the purchase of computers and related equipment 
we have in place a credit facility that consists of a revolving line of credit that allows us to manage our cash flows 
our ability to make payments on the credit facility  to replace our indebtedness if desired  and to fund working capital and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
we have secured our working capital facility through our accounts receivable and therefore  our ability to continue servicing debt is dependent upon the timely collection of those receivables 
we made capital expenditures of million in the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  we expect to continue to make capital expenditures to build new service centers  meet new contract requirements and maintain and upgrade our technology

the abl facility has a term of four years at an interest rate of wells fargo s base rate plus basis points or libor plus basis points at our discretion 
the abl facility has a fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenant that is operative when our availability under the facility is less than million 
at december   we had million available under the abl facility 
we were in compliance with the financial covenants as of december  
table of contents letters of credit 
we have certain standby letters of credit for the benefit of landlords of certain sites in the united states and canada 
as of december   we had approximately million of these letters of credit in place under our abl facility 
the obligations under the letters of credit decline annually as the underlying obligations are satisfied 
contractual obligations 
we have various contractual obligations that will affect our liquidity 
the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt obligations revolving debt obligations operating lease obligations capital lease obligations total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled million for the year ended december  which is a million increase compared to million for the year ended december  working capital increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for the year ended december   a million increase from the million used in the year ended december  non cash charges were million greater in the year ended december  than those generated in the period ended december  primarily as a result of the million increase for the depreciation and amortization of acquired assets related to the purchase of egs 
the increase in cash inflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities of million is primarily due to acquisition related cash outflows in related to the acquisition of egs 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million for the year ended december  which is a million decrease from the million provided by the period ended december  this is primarily attributable cash acquired in the acquisition of egs in we used million for additions to equipment and fixtures for the year ended december  as compared to million use of cash for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities totaled million for the year ended december   a million decrease from the million of cash provided by financing activities for the period ended december  our foreign exchange forward contracts require the exchange of foreign currencies for us dollars or vice versa  and generally mature in one to months 
we had outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts with aggregate notional amounts of million as of december  and million as of december  we believe that our cash generated from operations  existing cash and cash equivalents  and available credit will be sufficient to meet expected operating and capital expenditures for the next months 
off balance sheet arrangements with the exception of operating leases discussed above  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents seasonality we are exposed to seasonality in our revenues because of the nature of certain consumer based clients 
we may experience approximately increased volume associated with the peak processing needs in the fourth quarter coinciding with the holiday period and a somewhat seasonal overflow into the first quarter of the following calendar year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
our risk management strategy includes the use of derivative instruments to reduce the effects on our operating results and cash flows from fluctuations caused by volatility in currency exchange and interest rates 
in using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates we exposes ourselves to counterparty credit risk 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our debt facilities since some of those instruments  including capital leases  bear interest at variable rates 
at december   we had outstanding borrowings under variable debt agreements that totaled approximately million 
a hypothetical increase in the interest rate would have increased interest expense by approximately million and would have decreased annual cash flow by a comparable amount 
the carrying amount of our borrowings reflects fair value due to their short term and variable interest rate features 
there were no outstanding interest rate derivatives covering interest rate exposure at december  foreign currency exchange rate risk we serve many of our us based clients using our service centers in canada  india  the dominican republic  el salvador  egypt  the philippines  nicaragua and costa rica 
although the contracts with these clients are typically priced in us dollars  a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts are denominated in the local currency of the country in which the contracts are serviced which creates foreign exchange exposure 
we serve most of our emea based clients using our service centers in the netherlands  the united kingdom  italy  ireland  spain  sweden  france  germany  poland  denmark  bulgaria  egypt  tunisia and south africa 
we typically bill our emea based clients in euro or british pound sterling 
while a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts are denominated in euro  a part is also denominated in the local currency in which the contracts are serviced which creates foreign exchange exposure 
the expenses from these foreign operations create exposure to changes in exchange rates between the local currencies and the contractual currencies primarily the us dollar and euro 
as a result  we may experience foreign currency gains and losses  which may positively or negatively affect our results of operations attributed to these subsidiaries 
the majority of this exposure is related to work performed from call centers in canada  india and the philippines 
in order to manage the risk of these foreign currencies from strengthening against the currency used for billing  which thereby decreases the economic benefit of performing work in these countries  we may hedge a portion  though not  of these foreign currency exposures 
while our hedging strategy may protect us from adverse changes in foreign currency rates in the short term  an overall strengthening of the foreign currencies would adversely impact margins over the long term 

table of contents the following summarizes the relative weakening strengthening of the us dollar against the local currency during the years presented year ended december  us dollar vs 
canadian dollar us dollar vs 
euro us dollar vs 
indian rupee us dollar vs 
philippine peso us dollar vs 
s 
african rand us dollar vs 
us pound sterling cash flow hedging program substantially all of our subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency as a result of paying labor and operating costs in those local currencies 
certain of our subsidiaries in the philippines use the us dollar as their functional currency while paying their labor and operating cost in local currency 
conversely  revenue for most of these foreign subsidiaries is derived principally from client contracts that are invoiced and collected in us dollars and other foreign currencies 
to mitigate against the risk of principally a weaker us dollar  we purchase forward contracts to acquire the local currency of the foreign subsidiary at a fixed exchange rate at specific dates in the future 
we have designated and account for certain of these derivative instruments as cash flow hedges where applicable  as defined by the authoritative guidance 
given the significance of our foreign operations and the potential volatility of the certain of these currencies versus the us dollar  we use forward purchases of philippine peso  canadian dollars  euros  south african rand and indian rupees to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations 
as of december   we had entered into forward contracts with four financial institutions to acquire the following currencies currency notional value usd equivalent highest rate lowest rate philippine peso canadian dollar indian rupee euro south african rand while we have implemented certain strategies to mitigate risks related to the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates  we cannot ensure that we will not recognize gains or losses from international transactions  as this is part of transacting business in an international environment 
not every exposure is or can be hedged and  where hedges are put in place based on expected foreign exchange exposure  they are based on forecasts for which actual results may differ from the original estimate 
failure to successfully hedge or anticipate currency risks properly could affect our consolidated operating results 
market risk market risk is the sensitivity of income to changes in interest rates  foreign exchanges  commodity prices  equity prices  and other market driven rates or prices 
changes in market rates may impact the banks libor rate or prime rate 
for instance  if either the libor or prime rate were to increase or decrease by one percentage point  our annual interest expense would change by approximately million based upon our total credit facility
