overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of new oncology therapeutics for the treatment of hematologic and solid tumor cancers 
our efforts are currently focused primarily on the development of vosaroxin formerly voreloxin for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia  or aml 
we have built a highly experienced cancer drug development organization committed to advancing our lead product candidate  vosaroxin  in multiple indications to improve the lives of people with cancer 
vosaroxin is a first in class anti cancer quinolone derivative  or aqd a class of compounds that has not been used previously for the treatment of cancer 
quinolone derivatives have been shown to mediate anti tumor activity by targeting mammalian topoisomerase ii  an enzyme critical for cell replication 
we own worldwide development and commercialization rights to vosaroxin 
in december  we commenced enrollment of a phase  multi national  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  pivotal trial of vosaroxin in combination with cytarabine in patients with relapsed or refractory aml  or the valor trial 
the valor trial is designed to evaluate the effect of vosaroxin in combination with cytarabine  a widely used chemotherapy in aml  on overall survival as compared to placebo in combination with cytarabine 
the trial design is based on data from our phase clinical trial of vosaroxin in combination with cytarabine in first relapsed or primary refractory aml  together with guidance received from both us and european regulatory agencies 
with an anticipated evaluable patients  the trial is designed to have a probability of detecting a difference in overall survival 
the trial includes a single pre specified interim analysis by the independent data safety monitoring board  or dsmb  that may recommend a one time sample size adjustment of additional evaluable patients if deemed beneficial by the dsmb to maintain adequate power across a range of 
table of contents clinically meaningful and statistically significant survival outcomes 
in february  the fda granted fast track designation to vosaroxin for the potential treatment of relapsed or refractory aml in combination with cytarabine 
we are also in the survival follow up stage of two fully enrolled clinical trials of vosaroxin a the phase portion of a phase b trial of vosaroxin in combination with cytarabine for the treatment of patients with first relapsed or primary refractory aml  and b a phase trial known as reveal in previously untreated elderly patients with aml  which explored three different dose schedules 
in addition  we completed a phase single agent trial of vosaroxin in platinum resistant ovarian cancer patients in  which explored three different dose cohorts 
the most recent data from the aml studies were presented at the chemotherapy foundation symposium xxviii in november  and the most recent data from the ovarian cancer study were presented at the american society of clinical oncology annual meeting in june in  the us food and drug administration  or fda  granted orphan drug designation to vosaroxin for the treatment of aml 
in july  we announced that the european patent office  or epo  had granted us a patent covering combinations of vosaroxin with cytarabine 
the patent provides coverage to for such combination products in member states of the european patent convention 
in november  we announced that the us patent and trademark office had granted us a patent covering pharmaceutical compositions of vosaroxin  and in march  we announced that the epo had granted us a similar patent  which we are proceeding to validate in multiple epo member states 
these patents cover the formulation used in our valor trial and extend vosaroxin s patent life to related patent applications are pending in other major markets throughout the world  including japan  australia and canada 
recent financial history in march  we entered into a securities purchase agreement with accredited investors  including certain members of management  providing for the private placement of up to million of units consisting of series a convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock  and up to million in common stock  in three closings  or the private placement 
we completed the initial closing of million in april  resulting in net proceeds of million  and the second closing of million in october  for net proceeds of million 
in june  we completed the third and final closing of the private placement  issuing million shares of common stock to the investors at a purchase price of per share  for net proceeds of million 
in conjunction with this closing  each of the million outstanding shares of series a convertible preferred stock issued in the initial and second closings of the private placement was converted into shares of common stock  and as a result  million shares of common stock were issued in june in january  we entered into our first controlled equity offering sales agreement with cantor fitzgerald co  or cantor  pursuant to which we could issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million from time to time through cantor acting as agent and or principal  subject to certain conditions 
under this facility  we sold an aggregate of million shares of common stock in at an average price of per share for gross proceeds of million 
net proceeds were million after deducting cantor s commission and costs to set up the facility 
no further shares of common stock can be issued under this facility 
in april  we entered into a second controlled equity offering sales agreement with cantor  pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million from time to time through cantor acting as agent and or principal 
as of march   we had sold an aggregate of million shares of common stock at an average price of per share for gross proceeds of million 
net proceeds were million after deducting cantor s commission and costs to set up the facility 
as of march   million of common stock was available to be sold under this facility  subject to certain conditions as specified in the agreement 

table of contents in october  we completed an underwritten offering  pursuant to which we issued an aggregate of million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock  for aggregate gross proceeds of million  or the offering 
net proceeds from the sale were million  after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses 
the warrants are exercisable beginning six months after issuance at an exercise price of per share  and expire five years from the date of issuance 
on february   we effected a one for six reverse split of our capital stock  or the reverse split  as previously authorized and approved at our annual meeting of stockholders on june  as a result of the reverse split  every six shares of our capital stock were combined into one share of capital stock 
the reverse split affected all our common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the reverse split as well as the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under our equity incentive plans 
in addition  the reverse split effected a reduction in the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants 
immediately following the reverse split   shares of our common stock were outstanding 
all share and per share amounts in this annual report on form k have been adjusted to give effect to the reverse split 
we have incurred significant losses in each year since our inception 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million and an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future  as we continue the development of  and seek regulatory approvals for vosaroxin 
on march   we received a letter from the nasdaq listing qualifications staff  or the staff  notifying us that we did not comply with the minimum per share closing bid price requirement  or the bid price requirement  for a continued listing on the nasdaq capital market 
in accordance with nasdaq listing rules  we were given until september  to regain compliance 
on september   we received a second letter from the staff notifying us of its determination that we had failed to regain compliance with the bid price requirement by september   but that we met all other initial inclusion criteria for the nasdaq capital market set forth in nasdaq listing rule as a result  in accordance with nasdaq listing rules  we were granted an additional calendar days  or until march   to regain compliance 
to regain compliance  the bid price of our common stock needed to close at or above for at least consecutive business days at any time prior to march  our common stock began trading on the nasdaq capital market on a post reverse split basis on february  subsequently  the bid price of our common stock closed at or above for the consecutive business days ended march   and on march   we received a letter from nasdaq notifying us that we had regained compliance with the bid price requirement 
capital requirements while we believe that we currently have the resources available and accessible to fund our operations until the planned unblinding of the valor trial in  we will need to raise substantial additional capital to complete development and the potential commercialization of vosaroxin 
to the extent that the costs of the valor trial exceed our current estimates  unblinding does not occur within the currently anticipated timeframe or we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital through our controlled equity offering facility or otherwise  we will need to reduce operating expenses  enter into a collaboration or other similar arrangement with respect to development and or commercialization rights to vosaroxin  outlicense intellectual property rights to vosaroxin  sell assets  or a combination of the above 
we will also need to raise substantial additional capital if we expand the number of patients included in the trial based on the pre specified interim analysis of data from the trial by the dsmb 
in addition  we will need to raise substantial additional capital to complete the development and potential commercialization of vosaroxin 
we expect to finance our future cash needs primarily through equity issuances  debt arrangements  a possible license  collaboration or other similar arrangement with respect to development and or 
table of contents commercialization rights to vosaroxin  or a combination of the above 
however  we do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to raise substantial additional funding on acceptable terms or at all  we will be forced to delay or reduce the scope of our vosaroxin development program  potentially including the valor trial  and or limit or cease our operations 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes  including reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  as well as revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates  assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for equity financings the accounting for the initial and second closing of the sale of million and million of units  respectively  under our private placement  and subsequent revaluations of the related financial instruments  required fair values to be established at different dates  either individually or in aggregate  for the four primary components of the private placement a the series a convertible preferred stock  b the warrants to purchase common stock  c the option for the investors to participate in the second closing  or the second closing option  and d the option for the investors to participate in the common equity closing  or the common equity closing option 
the option pricing method  which utilizes the black scholes model  was selected to determine these fair values  which were calculated as a series of call options on the potential enterprise value of the company at different valuation points at which the claims of the different stakeholder groups on the enterprise value would change 
the results of the black scholes model were affected by the company s stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly subjective variables 
these variables included the expected term of the financial instruments and our expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and dividend rate over the expected term 
alternative models could have been selected to calculate these fair values  which may have produced significantly different results 
in october  we completed the offering  in which we sold our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of million 
due to the potential for the warrants to be settled in cash upon the occurrence of certain transactions specified in the warrant agreements  the warrants are being accounted for as a derivative liability as opposed to permanent equity 
outstanding warrants under this arrangement are revalued to their fair value each period end  with the change in fair value recorded to other income expense in the statement of operations 
the black scholes model was selected as the most appropriate method to estimate both the initial and subsequent fair values of the warrants 
the determination of initial and subsequent fair values is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables  as noted above 
changes in these input variables have  and will continue to  affect the income or expense recorded each period for the revaluation of outstanding warrants 
as a result  fluctuations in our stock price or other input variables may significantly affect our financial results 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are accounted for in accordance with financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification subtopic  multiple element arrangements  or asc under asc  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting based on whether certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered item has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their respective fair value  and the applicable revenue recognition is applied to each of the separate units 
non refundable fees where we have no continuing performance obligations are recognized as revenues when collection is reasonably assured 
in situations where continuing performance obligations exist  nonrefundable fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the projected performance period 
research funding from collaborations is recognized as revenue as the related research services are performed 
this funding is generally based on a specified amount per full time equivalent employee per year 
milestone payments which are substantive and at risk at the time of the execution of the collaboration agreement  are recognized upon completion of the applicable milestone event 
any future royalty revenue will be recognized based on reported product sales by third party licensees 
clinical trial accounting we record accruals for estimated clinical trial costs  which include payments for work performed by contract research organizations  or cros  and participating clinical trial sites 
these costs are generally a significant component of research and development expenses 
costs incurred for setting up clinical trial sites for participation in trials are generally non refundable  and are expensed immediately  with any refundable advances related to enrollment of the first patient recorded as prepayments and assessed for recoverability on a quarterly basis 
costs related to patient enrollment are accrued as patients progress through the clinical trial  including amortization of any first patient prepayments 
this amortization generally matches when the related services are rendered  however  these cost estimates may or may not match the actual costs incurred by the cros or clinical trial sites  and if we have incomplete or inaccurate information  our clinical trial accruals may not be accurate 
the difference between accrued expenses based on our estimates and actual expenses have not been material to date 
overview of revenues we have not generated any revenue from sales of commercial products and do not expect to generate any product revenue in the foreseeable future 
collaboration revenue over the past three years  we have generated revenue primarily through collaborations with biogen idec  j jprd and merck  consisting principally of research funding and milestones paid by our collaborators  substantially offsetting our related research and development expenses 
our collaborations with j jprd and merck terminated in january and june  respectively 
under our collaboration agreement with biogen idec  we may in the future receive pre commercialization milestone payments of up to million per target  as well as royalty payments depending on product sales 
potential total royalty payments may be increased if we exercise our option to co develop and co promote product candidates for up to two targets worldwide excluding japan and may be reduced if biogen idec is required to in license additional intellectual property related to certain technology jointly developed under the collaboration agreement in order to commercialize a collaboration product 

table of contents in november  biogen idec announced that it will seek to spin out or outlicense certain oncology assets  including this collaboration agreement 
we cannot predict the outcome of this strategic decision by biogen idec or its impact on future development activity under the collaboration agreement or on our prospects for the receipt of milestone or royalty payments under the collaboration agreement 
we expect that a phase clinical trial will be initiated in for the raf kinase inhibitor program 
license and other revenue in march  sarcode acquired our interest in all of its lfa patents and related know how for a total cash consideration of million  which was recorded as revenue in april in connection with the sale  the license agreement was terminated and we will not receive any future license fees  milestones or royalties under that license 
we still hold three secured convertible promissory notes issued under the original license agreement  with a total principal value of million  which are due in and are convertible into the preferred stock of sarcode at our option 
we have yet to record the amount represented by these notes as revenue  due to uncertainty of their collectibility 
overview of operating expenses research and development expense 
most of our operating expenses to date have been for research and development activities  and include costs incurred in the preparation and execution of clinical trials  including those for vosaroxin  in the discovery and development of novel small molecule therapeutics  in the development of novel fragment based drug discovery methods  in the development and use of in house research  preclinical study and development capabilities  in connection with in licensing activities  and in the conduct of activities related to strategic collaborations 
we expense all research and development costs as they are incurred 
we do not anticipate incurring any significant additional research expenses related to the discovery of additional product candidates  the development or application of our proprietary fragment based drug discovery methods  or the development of in house research capabilities 
in addition  we are no longer conducting any research activities in connection with our collaborations 
in december  we commenced enrollment of the valor trial 
payments to sites for start up costs and patient treatment are expected to increase in as sites are activated to enroll patients 
similarly  costs incurred by our contract research organization and other third party contractors  including the contract manufacturers of the vosaroxin api and fdp  in the execution of the trial are expected to increase in as a result  we expect research and development expense to be significantly higher in as compared to we are currently developing vosaroxin in aml 
based on results of translational research  clinical results  regulatory and competitive concerns and our overall financial resources  we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which indications to pursue and patient populations to treat in the future  and how much funding to direct to each indication on an ongoing basis 
this will affect our research and development expense going forward 

table of contents if we engage a development or commercialization partner for our vosaroxin program  or if  in the future  we acquire additional product candidates  our research and development expenses could be significantly affected 
we cannot predict whether future licensing or collaborative arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
as of december   we had incurred million of expenses in the development of vosaroxin since it was licensed from dainippon sumitomo pharma co  ltd  or dainippon  in october we expect to continue to incur significant expenses related to the development of vosaroxin in and future years 
due to the above uncertainties and other risks inherent in the development process  we are unable to estimate the significant costs we will incur in the vosaroxin development program 
under our collaboration agreement with biogen idec  we have the right to participate in the co development and co promotion of product candidates for up to two targets including  at our option  the raf kinase target  on a worldwide basis excluding japan 
if we were to exercise our option on one or more product candidates  our research and development expense would increase significantly 
in november  biogen idec announced that it will seek to spin out or outlicense certain oncology assets  including this collaboration agreement 
we cannot predict the outcome of this strategic decision by biogen idec or its impact on future development activity under the collaboration agreement 
we expect that a phase clinical trial will be initiated in for the raf kinase inhibitor program 
general and administrative expense 
our general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in finance  legal  marketing  information technology  administration and general management  as well as non cash stock based compensation 
other significant costs include fees paid to professional services providers and those related to facilities 
in  we expect general and administrative expense to be generally comparable to results of operations years ended december  and revenue 
total revenue decreased to  in from million in collaboration revenue of million in was primarily comprised of a million milestone earned from biogen idec s selection of a raf kinase inhibitor development candidate for the treatment of cancer 
license and other revenue of million in was primarily comprised of million from the sale to sarcode corporation of our interest in all patents and related know how that had previously been the subject of a license agreement with them 
research and development expense 
research and development expense increased to million in from million in  with substantially all of the expense in each period relating to the vosaroxin development program 
the increase in was primarily due to an increase in clinical expenses  primarily related to the launch of the valor trial  of million and the accrual of a million milestone payment due to dainippon as a result of the initiation of the valor trial in december  which we partially offset by a reduction in facility costs of million 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease in was primarily due to a restructuring plan initiated in march  or the restructuring  which resulted in a reduction of million in headcount related expenses  including million related to non cash stock compensation expense 
restructuring charges 
there were no restructuring charges in restructuring charges were million in  which included million for lease termination activities related to a corporate realignment initiated in june  or the restructuring  and million for employee severance and related benefit costs related to the restructuring 

table of contents other income expense  net 
other expense  net was million in as compared to million in the net expense in was primarily due to a non cash charge of million for the revaluation of warrants issued in the offering to their fair value as of december   partially offset by the receipt of a tax credit of million under the irs qualifying therapeutic discovery project program 
the net expense in was primarily due to non cash charges of million related to the accounting for the private placement  which consisted of million recorded upon the initial closing in april and million upon the revaluation in june of the second closing option and common equity closing option 
years ended december  and revenue 
total revenue decreased to million in from million in collaboration revenue decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to the completion of research funding and technology access fee amortization under the biogen idec collaboration in june  partially offset by an increase in milestone revenue in as a result of a million milestone from biogen idec  as described above 
license and other revenue increased to million in from million in  primarily due to the sale to sarcode of certain intellectual property  as described above 
research and development expense 
research and development expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to the restructuring  which resulted in decreases in headcount related expenses of million  allocated facility costs of million  clinical expenses of million and professional service costs of million 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to the restructuring and the restructuring  which together resulted in decreases in headcount related expenses of million  facility costs of million and a reduction in professional service costs of million 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges were million in as compared to million in the charges for are described above 
the charges were primarily comprised of million related to the restructuring  which consisted of million for employee severance and related benefit costs  including non cash stock based compensation of million  and million related to asset impairment and facility exit costs 
other income expense  net 
other expense  net was million in as compared to other income  net of million in the net expense in was primarily due to non cash charges of million related to the accounting for the private placement  as described above 
the net income in primarily related to interest income 
income taxes deferred tax assets or liabilities may arise from differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their basis for financial reporting 
deferred tax assets or liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
our policy is to recognize interest charges and penalties as other expense 
since inception  we have incurred operating losses and  accordingly  have not recorded a provision for income taxes for any of the periods presented 
as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards for federal and state income tax purposes of million and million  respectively 
we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carry forwards of million and million  respectively 
if not utilized  the federal net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards will expire at various dates beginning in and the state net operating loss will begin to expire in the state research and 
table of contents development tax credit carry forwards do not expire 
utilization of these net operating loss and tax credits carry forwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change rules under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code 
the limitations are applicable if an ownership change  as defined in the code  is deemed to have occurred or occurs in the future 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss and credit carry forwards before they can be utilized 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of common and preferred stock  the receipt of funds from our collaboration partners  and from debt financings 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million as of december   compared to million as of december  the increase of million was primarily due to net proceeds of million from sales of our common stock through cantor  million from the third closing of the private placement  and million from the offering  partially offset by million of net cash used in operating activities 
in january  we entered into our first controlled equity offering sales agreement with cantor  under which we sold an aggregate of million shares of common stock at an average price of per share for gross proceeds of million 
net proceeds were million after deducting cantor s commission and costs to set up the facility 
in april  we entered into a second controlled equity offering sales agreement with cantor  pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million from time to time through cantor acting as agent and or principal  subject to certain conditions 
cantor is entitled to a commission rate of the gross sales price per share of any common stock sold through cantor as agent under the sales agreement 
as of december   we had sold an aggregate of million shares of common stock at an average price of per share for gross proceeds of million 
net proceeds were million after deducting cantor s commission and costs to set up the facility  of which million was received upon settlement in january as of december   million of common stock was available to be sold under this facility  subject to certain conditions as specified in the agreement 
in june  we completed the third and final closing of the private placement  issuing million shares of common stock to the investors at a purchase price of per share  for gross proceeds of million and net proceeds of million 
in october  we completed the offering  pursuant to which we issued an aggregate of million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock  for aggregate gross proceeds of million 
net proceeds from the sale were million  after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses 
the warrants are exercisable beginning six months after issuance at an exercise price of per share  and expire five years from the date of issuance 
cash flows net cash used in operating activities was million in  compared to million used in and million in net cash used in resulted primarily from the net loss of million  partially offset by net adjustments for non cash items of million including million of charges related to the offering 
net cash used in resulted primarily from the net loss of million  and changes in operating assets and liabilities of million  partially offset by net adjustments for non cash items of million including million of charges related to the private placement and million of stock based 
table of contents compensation  partially offset by a million credit for deferred rent related to the restructuring 
net cash used in resulted primarily from the net loss of million  and changes in operating assets and liabilities of million including decreases of million in deferred revenue and million in accrued compensation  partially offset by adjustments for non cash items of million including million of restructuring charges  million of stock based compensation and million of depreciation and amortization 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to million and million provided by investing activities in and  respectively 
net cash used in consisted primarily of net outflows from marketable securities transactions 
net cash provided in consisted primarily of net proceeds from marketable securities transactions of million 
net cash provided in consisted primarily of net proceeds from marketable securities transactions of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared to million provided by financing activities in  and million used in financing activities in net cash provided in the period consisted primarily of net proceeds of million from the third closing of the private placement  million from sales of common stock under the two controlled equity offering sales agreements with cantor  and million from the offering 
net cash provided in consisted primarily of net proceeds from the initial and second closings of the private placement 
net cash used in consisted primarily of equipment loan repayments of million 
operating cash requirements we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses in the future 
we will not receive any product revenue until a product candidate has been approved by the fda or similar regulatory agencies in other countries  and has been successfully commercialized  if at all 
we need to raise substantial additional funding to complete the development and potential commercialization of vosaroxin 
additionally  we may evaluate in licensing and acquisition opportunities to gain access to new drugs or drug targets that would fit with our strategy 
any such transaction would likely increase our funding needs in the future 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials  including the valor trial in particular  the need for additional or expanded clinical trials including in particular potential expansion of the number of patients included in the valor trial based on the pre specified interim analysis of data from the trial by the dsmb  the timing and economic and other terms of any licensing  collaboration or other similar arrangement into which we may enter  the costs and timing of seeking and obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals  the extent of our other development activities  the costs associated with building or accessing commercialization and additional manufacturing capabilities and supplies  the costs of acquiring or investing in businesses  product candidates and technologies  if any  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  
table of contents the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the costs of supporting our collaboration with biogen idec  if any 
we believe that we currently have the resources available and accessible to fund our operations until the planned unblinding of the valor trial in to the extent that the costs of the valor trial exceed our current estimates  unblinding does not occur within the currently anticipated timeframe or we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital through our controlled equity offering facility or otherwise  we will need to reduce operating expenses  enter into a collaboration or other similar arrangement with respect to development and or commercialization rights to vosaroxin  outlicense intellectual property rights to vosaroxin  sell assets  or a combination of the above 
we will need to raise substantial additional capital if we expand the number of patients included in the valor trial based on the pre specified interim analysis of data from the trial by the dsmb 
in addition  we will need to raise substantial additional capital to complete the development and potential commercialization of vosaroxin 
we expect to finance our future cash needs primarily through equity issuances  debt arrangements  a possible license  collaboration or other similar arrangement with respect to development and or commercialization rights to vosaroxin  or a combination of the above 
until we can generate a sufficient amount of collaboration or product revenue to finance our cash requirements  which we may never do  we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through the above means 
however  we do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
our failure to raise significant additional capital in the future would force us to delay or reduce the scope of our vosaroxin development program  potentially including the valor trial  and or limit or cease our operations 
any one of the foregoing would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
contractual obligations our operating lease obligations as of december  relate solely to the lease of approximately  square feet of office space in a building at oyster point boulevard in south san francisco  california  which is currently our corporate headquarters 
the lease was entered into in december  and expires in april  subject to our option to extend the lease through february under our license agreement with dainippon  we are required to make certain milestone payments in the event we file new drug applications in the united states  europe or japan  and if we receive regulatory approvals in any of these regions  for cancer related indications 
if vosaroxin is approved for a non cancer indication  an additional milestone payment becomes payable to dainippon 
we also have agreements with cros  clinical sites and other third party contractors for the conduct of our clinical trials 
we generally make payments to these entities based upon the activities they perform related to the particular clinical trial 
there are generally no penalty clauses for cancellation of these agreements if notice is duly given and payment is made for work performed by the third party under the related agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements since our inception  we have not had any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities  which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes
