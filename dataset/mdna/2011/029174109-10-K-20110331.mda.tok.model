we will  from time to time  also enter into partnerships with various investors to acquire income producing properties or land and to sell interests in certain of our wholly owned properties 
when we sell assets  we may carry a portion of the sales price generally in the form of a short term  interest bearing seller financed note receivable 
we generate operating revenues primarily by leasing apartment units to residents  leasing office  retail and industrial space to commercial tenants  and renting hotel rooms to guests 
we have historically engaged in and may continue to engage in certain business transactions with related parties  including but not limited to asset acquisition and dispositions 
transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm s length basis due to the absence of free market forces that naturally exist in business dealings between two or more unrelated entities 
related party transactions may not always be favorable to our business and may include terms  conditions and agreements that are not necessarily beneficial to or in our best interest 
we are advised by prime under a contractual arrangement that is reviewed annually by our board of directors

we currently contract with third party companies to manage our apartment communities 
critical accounting policies we present our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb completed its accounting guidance codification project 
the fasb accounting standards codification asc became effective for our financial statements issued subsequent to september  and is the single source of 
table of contents authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap 
as of the effective date  we no longer refer to the authoritative guidance dictating our accounting methodologies under the previous accounting standards hierarchy 
instead  we refer to the asc guidance as the sole source of authoritative literature 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts  our subsidiaries  generally all of which are wholly owned  and all entities in which we have a controlling interest 
arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as a variable interest entity vie  in accordance with the provisions and guidance of asc topic consolidation  whereby we have determined that we are a primary beneficiary of the vie and meet certain criteria of a sole general partner or managing member as identified in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue  investor s accounting for an investment in a limited partnership when the investor is the sole general partner and the limited partners have certain rights eitf 
vies are generally entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without additional financial support from other parties or whose equity holders as a group lack adequate decision making ability  the obligation to absorb expected losses or residual returns of the entity  or have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests 
the primary beneficiary generally is the entity that provides financial support and bears a majority of the financial risks  authorizes certain capital transactions  or makes operating decisions that materially affect the entity s financial results 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a vie  we consider qualitative and quantitative factors  including  but not limited to the amount and characteristics of our investment  the obligation or likelihood for us or other investors to provide financial support  our and the other investors ability to control or significantly influence key decisions for the vie  and the similarity with and significance to the business activities of us and the other investors 
significant judgments related to these determinations include estimates about the current future fair values and performance of real estate held by these vies and general market conditions 
for entities in which we have less than a controlling financial interest or entities where we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary  the entities are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
accordingly  our share of the net earnings or losses of these entities are included in consolidated net income 
our investments in gruppa florentina  llc  lk four hickory  llc  and garden centura  lp are accounted for under the equity method 
real estate upon acquisitions of real estate  we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets  including land  buildings  tenant improvements  above market and below market leases  origination costs  acquired in place leases  other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with asc topic business combinations  and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities  including land at appraised value and buildings at replacement cost 
we assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and or capitalization rates  as well as available market information 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known and anticipated trends  and market and economic conditions 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant 
we also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles  including acquired in place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value  including but not limited to the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants  the tenants credit quality and expectations of lease renewals 
based on our acquisitions to date  our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial 

table of contents we record acquired above market and below market leases at their fair values using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired equal to the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease  measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases 
other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease 
factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  depending on local market conditions 
in estimating costs to execute similar leases  we consider leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses 
depreciation and impairment real estate is stated at depreciated cost 
the cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property  legal fees and other acquisition costs 
costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized 
capitalized development costs include interest  property taxes  insurance  and other project costs incurred during the period of development 
management reviews its long lived assets used in operations for impairment when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates impairment in value 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of its assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
if such impairment is present  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
if we determine that impairment has occurred  the affected assets must be reduced to their face value 
asc topic property  plant and equipment requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold  or otherwise qualify as held for sale  be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and we will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale 
the components of the property s net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain or loss upon the disposition of the property held for sale  operating results  depreciation and interest expense if the property is subject to a secured loan 
we generally consider assets to be held for sale when the transaction has been approved by our board of directors  or a committee thereof  and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale  such that the property sale within one year is considered probable 
following the classification of a property as held for sale  no further depreciation is recorded on the assets 
a variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition  development and leasing of properties 
after determination is made to capitalize a cost  it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited 
determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment 
our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by asc topic interest capitalization of interest and asc topic real estate general 
the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs 
the capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property  development costs  construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes  salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development 
we consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the receipt of certificates of occupancy  but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity 
we cease capitalization on the portion substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy  and we capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction 

table of contents investment in unconsolidated real estate ventures except for ownership interests in variable interest entities  we account for our investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures under the equity method of accounting because we exercise significant influence over  but do not control  these entities 
these investments are recorded initially at cost  as investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures  and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions 
any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on our balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures over the life of the related asset 
under the equity method of accounting  our net equity is reflected within the consolidated balance sheets  and our share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included within the consolidated statements of operations 
the joint venture agreements may designate different percentage allocations among investors for profits and losses  however  our recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint venture s distribution priorities  which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds 
for ownership interests in variable interest entities  we consolidate those in which we are the primary beneficiary 
recognition of rental income rental income for commercial property leases is recognized on a straight line basis over the respective lease terms 
in accordance with asc topic business combinations  we recognize rental revenue of acquired in place above market and below market leases at their fair values over the terms of the respective leases 
on our consolidated balance sheets  we include as a receivable the excess of rental income recognized over rental payments actually received pursuant to the terms of the individual commercial lease agreements 
reimbursements of operating costs  as allowed under most of our commercial tenant leases  consist of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance  real estate taxes and other recoverable costs  and are recognized as revenue in the period in which the recoverable expenses are incurred 
we record these reimbursements on a gross basis  since we generally are the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third party suppliers  have discretion in selecting the supplier and have the credit risk with respect to paying the supplier 
rental income for residential property leases is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as earned  which is not materially different than on a straight line basis as lease terms are generally for periods of one year or less 
for hotel properties  revenues for room sales and guest services are recognized as rooms are occupied and services are rendered 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for all past due rents and operating expense reimbursements considered to be uncollectible 
revenue recognition on the sale of real estate sales and the associated gains or losses of real estate are recognized in accordance with the provisions of asc topic  property  plant and equipment real estate sale 
the specific timing of a sale is measured against various criteria in asc related to the terms of the transaction and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties 
if the sales criteria for the full accrual method are not met  we defer some or all of the gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance  leasing  deposit  installment or cost recovery methods  as appropriate  until the sales criteria are met 
non performing notes receivable we consider a note receivable to be non performing when the maturity date has passed without principal repayment and the borrower is not making interest payments in accordance with the terms of the agreement 

table of contents interest recognition on notes receivable for notes other than surplus cash notes  we record interest income as earned in accordance with the terms of the related loan agreements 
on cash flow notes where payments are based upon surplus cash from operations  accrued but unpaid interest income is only recognized to the extent cash is received 
allowance for estimated losses we assess the collectability of notes receivable on a periodic basis  of which the assessment consists primarily of an evaluation of cash flow projections of the borrower to determine whether estimated cash flows are sufficient to repay principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the note 
we recognize impairments on notes receivable when it is probable that principal and interest will not be received in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan 
the amount of the impairment to be recognized generally is based on the fair value of the partnership s real estate that represents the primary source of loan repayment 
see note notes and interest receivable for details on our notes receivable 
fair value of financial instruments we apply the guidance in asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  to the valuation of real estate assets 
these provisions define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in a transaction between market participants at the measurement date  establish a hierarchy that prioritizes the information used in developing fair value estimates and require disclosure of fair value measurements by level within the fair value hierarchy 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets level measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable data level measurements  such as the reporting entity s own data 
the valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date and includes three levels defined as follows level unadjusted quoted prices for identical and unrestricted assets or liabilities in active markets 
level quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
level unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement 
a financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
results of operations the discussion of our results of operations is based on management s review of operations  which is based on our segments 
our segments consist of apartments  commercial buildings  hotels  land and other 
for discussion purposes  we break these segments down into the following sub categories  same property portfolio  acquired properties  and developed properties in the lease up phase 
the same property portfolio consists of properties that were held by us for the entire period for both years being compared 
the acquired property portfolio consists of properties that we acquired but have not held for the entire period for both periods being compared 
developed properties in the lease up phase consist of completed projects that are being leased up 
as we complete each phase of the project  we lease up that phase and include those revenues in our continued 
table of contents operations 
once a developed property becomes leased up or more and is held the entire period for both years under comparison  it is considered to be included in the same property portfolio 
income producing properties that we have sold during the year are reclassified to discontinuing operations for all periods presented 
the following discussion is based on our consolidated statements of operations for the twelve months ended december    and as included in part ii
