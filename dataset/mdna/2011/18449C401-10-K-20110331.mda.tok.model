item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition and  as a result  our company s the legal acquirer consolidated financial statements are now those of csi the accounting acquirer  with the assets and liabilities  and revenues and expenses  of cdti included effective from october   the date of the closing of the merger 
for information regarding cdti s financial condition and results of operations as well as cdti s financial statements and related notes thereto reflecting cdti s business as a stand alone company for periods prior to the merger  please see our annual report on form k for the year ended december  and our quarterly reports on form q for periods prior to the closing of the merger 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our annual consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  the accuracy of which involves risks and uncertainties  see cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  as a result of many important factors  including the consolidation of cdti for periods after october   as well as those set forth in the item a risk factors 
overview we are a vertically integrated global manufacturer and distributor of emissions control systems and products  focused in the heavy duty diesel and light duty vehicle markets 
our emissions control systems and products are designed to deliver high value to our customers while benefiting the global environment through air quality improvement  sustainability and energy efficiency 
in light of the merger  we now organize our operations in two business divisions the heavy duty diesel systems division and the catalyst division 
we have included all of the operations of cdti in our heavy duty diesel systems division effective from the date of the closing of the merger 
heavy duty diesel systems through our heavy duty diesel systems division we design and manufacture verified exhaust emissions control solutions 
our heavy duty diesel systems division offers a full range of products for the verified retrofit and original equipment manufacturer  or oem  markets through its distribution dealer network and direct sales 
these ecs and clean diesel technologies branded products  such as purifilter  purifier  aris and exhaust gas recirculation with selective catalytic reduction are used to reduce exhaust emissions created by on road  off road and stationary diesel and alternative fuel engines including propane and natural gas 
revenues from our heavy duty diesel systems division accounted for approximately and of total consolidated revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
catalyst through our catalyst division  we produce catalyst formulations for gasoline  diesel and natural gas induced emissions that are offered for multiple markets and a wide range of applications 
a family of unique high performance catalysts has been developed with base metals or low platinum group metal and zero platinum group metal content to provide increased catalytic function and value for technology driven automotive industry customers 
our technical and manufacturing competence in the light duty vehicle market is aimed at meeting auto makers most stringent requirements  and we have supplied over ten million parts to light duty vehicle customers since our catalyst division also provides catalyst formulations for our heavy duty diesel systems division 
revenues from our catalyst division accounted for approximately and of total consolidated revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
sources of revenues and expenses revenues we generate revenues primarily from the sale of our emission control systems and products 
we generally recognize revenues from the sale of our emission control systems and products upon shipment of these products to our customers 
however  for certain customers  where risk of loss transfers at the destination typically the customer s warehouse  revenue is recognized when the products are delivered to the destination which is generally within five days of the shipment 

table of contents cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of direct costs for the manufacture of emission control systems and products  including cost of raw materials  costs of leasing and operating manufacturing facilities and wages paid to personnel involved in production  manufacturing quality control  testing and supply chain management 
in addition  cost of revenues include normal scrap and shrinkage associated with the manufacturing process and a expense from write down of obsolete and slow moving inventory 
we include the direct material costs and factory labor as well as factory overhead expense in the cost of revenue 
indirect factory expense includes the costs of freight inbound and outbound for direct material and finished goods  purchasing and receiving  inspection  testing  warehousing  utilities and deprecation of facilities and equipment utilized in the production and distribution of products 
selling  general and administrative expenses in prior periods we presented selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses separately on our statement of operations 
beginning in the year ended december   we now combine these categories of expenses into selling  general and administrative expenses because there is considerable overlap between management functions pertaining to sales and marketing and general administrative duties  and as such  estimating allocation of expenses associated with these overlapping functions is not meaningful 
prior periods have been reclassified to reflect this change in presentation 
selling  general and administrative expenses consists of our selling and marketing expenses  as well as our general and administrative expenses 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation paid to sales and marketing personnel  and marketing expenses 
costs related to sales and marketing are expensed as they are incurred 
these expenses include the salary and benefits for the sales and marketing staff as well as travel  samples provided at no cost to customers and marketing materials 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation paid to administrative personnel  legal and professional fees  corporate expenses and regulatory  bad debt and other administrative expenses 
these expenses include the salary and benefits for management and administrative staff as well as travel 
also included is any depreciation related to assets utilized in the selling  marketing and general and administrative functions 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of costs associated with research related to new product development and product enhancement expenditures 
research and development costs also include costs associated with getting our heavy duty diesel systems verified and approved for sale by the epa  the carb and other regulatory authorities 
these expenses include the salary and benefits for the research and development staff as well as travel  research materials  testing and legal expense related to patenting intellectual property 
also included is any depreciation related to assets utilized in the development of new products 
recapitalization expenses recapitalization expense consists primarily of the expense for legal  accounting and other advisory professional services as a result of our efforts in the years ended december  and to explore strategic opportunities resulting in the merger 
total other income expense total other income expense primarily reflects interest expense  including amounts related to the beneficial conversion feature of the secured convertible notes issued by csi prior to the merger  and changes in the fair value of certain of our financial instrument liabilities related to such secured convertible notes and changes in fair value of our liability classified warrants 
it also includes interest income as well as our share of income and losses from our asian joint venture and income or losses from sale of fixed assets 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and 
table of contents expenses  and related disclosures in the financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and that have a material impact on financial condition or operating performance 
while we base our estimates and judgments on our experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements require significant judgments and estimates 
for additional information relating to these and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition we generally recognize revenue when products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
where installation services  if provided  are essential to the functionality of the equipment  we defer the portion of revenue for the sale attributable to installation until we have completed the installation 
when terms of sale include subjective customer acceptance criteria  we defer revenue until the acceptance criteria are met 
concurrent with the shipment of the product  we accrue estimated product return reserves and warranty expenses 
critical judgments include the determination of whether or not customer acceptance criteria are perfunctory or inconsequential 
the determination of whether or not the customer acceptance terms are perfunctory or inconsequential impacts the amount and timing of the revenue that we recognize 
critical judgments also include estimates of warranty reserves  which are established based on historical experience and knowledge of the product 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts involves estimates based on management s judgment  review of individual receivables and analysis of historical bad debts 
we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we also assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in difficulties in their ability to make payments as they become due  additional allowances could be required  which would have a negative effect on our earnings and working capital 
inventory valuation inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the first in  first out method 
we write down inventory for slow moving and obsolete inventory based on assessments of future demands  market conditions and customers who are expected to reduce purchasing requirements as a result of experiencing financial difficulties 
such assessments require the exercise of significant judgment by management 
if these factors were to become less favorable than those projected  additional inventory write downs could be required  which would have a negative effect on our earnings and working capital 
accounting for income taxes our income tax expense is dependent on the profitability of our various international subsidiaries including canada and sweden  and going forward  the united kingdom 
these subsidiaries are subject to income taxation based on local tax laws in these countries 
our us operations have continually incurred losses since inception 
our annual tax expense is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities 
significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties 
we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 
if these factors were to become less favorable than those projected  or if there are changes in the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate  there could be an increase in tax expense and a resulting decrease in our earnings and working capital 
deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years 
such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of 
table of contents assets and liabilities  as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources  including reversal of taxable temporary differences  forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies 
these sources of income inherently rely on estimates 
to provide insight  we use our historical experience and our short and long range business forecasts 
we believe it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred income tax assets may expire unused and have established a valuation allowance against them 
although realization is not assured for the remaining deferred income tax assets  primarily related to foreign tax jurisdictions  we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be fully recoverable within the applicable statutory expiration periods 
however  deferred tax assets could be reduced in the near term if our estimates of taxable income in certain jurisdictions are significantly reduced or available tax planning strategies are no longer viable 
business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting  we record the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
we record the excess of purchase price over the aggregate fair values as goodwill 
we engage third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
these valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions  particularly with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing purchased technology  customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect a marketplace participant would generate from the acquired assets 
if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values  we could experience impairment charges 
in addition  we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense 
if our estimates of the economic lives change  depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 
goodwill we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually using a two step process  and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain triggering events 
only our heavy duty diesel systems reporting unit has goodwill subject to impairment testing  which totalled million and million at december  and  respectively 
goodwill impairment testing requires us to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit 
the estimate of fair value is based on internally developed assumptions approximating those that a market participant would use in valuing the reporting unit 
we derived the estimated fair value of the heavy duty diesel systems reporting unit at december  primarily from a discounted cash flow model 
significant assumptions used in deriving the fair value of the reporting unit included annual revenue growth over the next six years ranging from to  long term revenue growth of and a discount rate of 
we deemed that estimating cash flows discretely for six years was the most appropriate for our heavy duty diesel systems division reporting unit  as this division s business growth is driven by changes in the regulation of diesel emissions 
we anticipate the changing regulation of diesel emission in various countries over this period as well as the number of vehicles that will need to have updated emission systems installed 
we believe that we have a reasonable estimate of the opportunities over this period 
these new emission regulations are a driver of business growth for our heavy duty diesel systems division 
in order to take into account the business implications of such regulations and the population of vehicles that must meet those regulations  we estimated revenues and cash flows to meet the demands of this marketplace for a six year time period 
the discount rate of was developed based on a weighted cost of capital wacc analysis 
within the wacc analysis  the cost of equity assumption was developed using the capital asset pricing model capm 
the inputs in both the capm and the cost of debt assumption utilized in the wacc were developed for our heavy duty diesel systems division reporting unit using data from comparable companies 
while the revenue growth rates used are consistent with our historical growth patterns and consider future growth potential identified by management  there is no assurance such growth will be achieved 
in addition  we considered the overall fair value of our reporting units as compared to our fair value 
because the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by  we determined that no goodwill impairment existed as of december  however  it is reasonably possible that future results may differ from the estimates made during and future impairment tests may result in a different conclusion for the goodwill of our heavy duty diesel systems division reporting unit 
in addition  the use of different estimates or assumptions by management could lead to different results 
our estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is sensitive to certain factors  including but not limited to the following movements in our share price  changes in discount rates and our cost of capital  growth of the reporting unit s revenue  cost structure of the reporting unit  successful completion of research and 
table of contents development  capital expenditures  customer acceptance of new products  competition  general economic conditions and approval of the reporting unit s product by regulatory agencies 
impairment of long lived assets other than goodwill we evaluate long lived assets  including intangible assets other than goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the assets 
if an impairment does exist  we measure the impairment loss and record it based on discounted estimated future cash flows 
in estimating future cash flows  we group assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of cash flows from other asset groups 
considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of the assets and  accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from such estimates 
our most significant estimates and judgments relating to the long lived asset impairments include the timing and amount of projected future cash flows 
these estimates and judgments are based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and growth rates and other factors  actual results of which may vary significantly 
in  we recorded a million impairment charge and wrote down the assets of our catalyst division to fair value 
in and again in  we considered whether any events or changes in circumstance indicated that the carrying amount of our catalyst division s long lived assets  totalling million at december   may not be recoverable 
with the disruption of sales described in factors affecting future results below  we conducted a recoverability test on the fixed assets of the catalyst division as of june  and concluded that the expected undiscounted cash flows associated with the assets substantially exceed their carrying value 
our analysis utilized two different scenarios over a five year period with a probability weighting 
one scenario assumed no additional program wins while the other scenario was based on a set of assumed program wins  resulting of revenue growth ranging from zero to over the next years 
each scenario also included a terminal value based upon an estimated value of intellectual property that could be sold off 
no events occurred during the second half of that significantly altered the assumptions made at june  and would necessitate further analysis 
for the remaining long lived assets  all of which are included in the heavy duty diesel systems reporting unit  we concluded the expected undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets substantially exceed their carrying value 
in the event that actual results differ from our forecasts or the future outlook diminishes  the future cash flows and fair value of these assets could potentially decrease in the future  requiring further impairment charges 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumption and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results 
to the extent additional events or changes in circumstances occur  we may conclude that a non cash impairment charge against earnings is required  which could have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 
fair value of embedded financial instruments the secured convertible notes issued to investors by csi prior to the merger see recent developments csi pre merger capital raise below contain two embedded financial instruments that require separate accounting at fair value the premium redemption feature and the contingent equity forward 
the estimate of fair value of such financial instruments involves the exercise of significant judgment and the use of estimates by management 
the premium redemption instrument represents the fair value of the additional penalty premium of two times x the outstanding principal amount plus the default interest that would have been due if the secured convertible notes were in default 
because the noteholders had the option of demanding payment or providing additional time extensions after august   this instrument was considered a put option 
we estimated the fair value of the premium redemption instrument by calculating the present value of million plus accrued interest  based on an assumed payment date eleven months after default date using a high yield discount rate of  multiplied by an estimated probability of its exercise 
because the secured convertible notes were converted into csi common stock immediately prior to the merger  the premium redemption instrument expired unexercised  resulting in gain of million 
this amount represents the difference between the initial proceeds allocated to the instrument and its ultimate fair value of zero 
the contingent equity forward represents the additional million that the investors committed to fund immediately prior to closing of the merger 
because the funding would only have occurred from the same events that caused the secured convertible notes to automatically convert to csi equity prior to the merger  we considered it a commitment to purchase equity 
we estimated its fair value based on the intrinsic value of the forward  
table of contents discounted at a risk free rate multiplied by the estimated probability that the forward will fund 
during the year ended december   we recognized a loss of million 
this reflects the difference between the intrinsic value on the settlement date of million and the initial proceeds allocated to the instrument of million 
stock based compensation expense we account for share based compensation using fair value recognition and record stock based compensation as a charge to earnings net of the estimated impact of forfeited awards 
as such  we recognize stock based compensation cost only for those stock based awards that are estimated to ultimately vest over their requisite service period  based on the vesting provisions of the individual grants 
the process of estimating the fair value of stock based compensation awards and recognizing stock based compensation cost over their requisite service period involves significant assumptions and judgments 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using a monte carlo univariate pricing model for awards with market conditions and the black scholes option valuation model for the remaining awards  which requires that we make certain assumptions regarding i the expected volatility in the market price of our common stock  ii dividend yield  iii risk free interest rates  and iv the period of time employees are expected to hold the award prior to exercise referred to as the expected holding period 
as a result  if we revise our assumptions and estimates  our stock based compensation expense could change materially for future grants 
warrant derivative liability in light of the terms of certain of our outstanding warrants  we have determined that we are required to carry them at fair value until exercised or expired  and record changes in their fair value recorded in our results of operations in each reporting period 
at december   we had a liability of million related to liability classified warrants 
for the year ended december   we recorded a non cash charge of million to other expense in our statement of operations to reflect the change in fair value of these liability classified warrants 
the determination of fair value requires the use of judgment and estimates by management 
for common stock warrants with market conditions  we use the monte carlo pricing model to determine fair value on the grant date 
for other common stock warrants  we use the black scholes option valuation model  which requires that we make certain assumptions regarding i the expected volatility in the market price of our common stock  ii dividend yield  iii risk free interest rates  and iv the contractual terms of the warrants 
these variables are projected based on our historical data  experience  and other factors 
changes in any of these variables could result in material adjustments to the expense recognized for changes in the valuation of the warrant derivative liability 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued guidance designed to improve disclosures about fair value measurements 
the guidance requires reporting entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements  including significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements  and provide information on purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level 
the guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for level reconciliation disclosures  which are effective for annual periods beginning after december  we have included such additional disclosures in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in december  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts asu to clarify when testing for goodwill impairment is required 
the modifications clarify that when the carrying amount of a reporting unit is zero or negative  an entity must assume that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  perform an additional test to determine whether goodwill has been impaired and calculate the amount of that impairment 
the modifications are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those years 
early adoption is not permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this accounting update to have an impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
the amendments in this update specify that if a public entity presents comparative 
table of contents financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures under asc topic to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
the amendments in this update are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  early adoption is permitted 
we will adopt this accounting update for acquisitions with acquisition dates on or after january   as required

recent developments new financing agreement with fgi  repayment of fifth third bank on february   we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into separate sale and security agreements with faunus group international  inc  or fgi  to provide for a million secured demand financing facility backed by our receivables and inventory 
on february   we used approximately million of proceeds from advances under this facility to pay in full the balance of our obligations under our credit facility with fifth third bank 
for more information relating to the fgi and fifth third facilities  see description of indebtedness below and notes and to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
loan from shareholder  repayment of settlement obligation on december   we executed a loan commitment letter with kanis sa  a shareholder of our company  pursuant to which kanis sa loaned us million

table of contents closing of merger on october   following receipt of necessary shareholder approvals  our wholly owned subsidiary  cdti merger sub  inc  merged with and into csi  with csi as the surviving corporation pursuant to the merger agreement 
csi is now our wholly owned subsidiary 
immediately prior to the merger  and as contemplated by the merger agreement  a one for six reverse stock split took effect 
pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement  each outstanding share of i csi class a common stock was converted into and became exchangeable for fully paid and non assessable shares of our common stock on a post split basis with any fractional shares to be paid in cash and warrants to acquire fully paid and non assessable shares of our common stock for per share on a post split basis merger warrants  and ii csi class b common stock was converted into and became exchangeable for fully paid and non assessable shares of our common stock on a post split basis with any fractional shares to be paid in cash 
accordingly  we issued  shares of common stock including  shares reserved for csi s outstanding in the money warrant and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock including  warrants reserved for issuance for csi s outstanding in the money warrants in exchange for all outstanding csi class a common stock and  shares of common stock in exchange for all outstanding csi class b common stock 
in connection with the merger and as contemplated by the merger agreement  we also issued  shares of our common stock on a post split basis and merger warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock on a post split basis to allen company llc  csi s financial advisor 
the merger warrants expire on the earlier of x october  the third anniversary of the effective time of the merger and y the date that is days after we give notice to the warrant holder that the market value of one share of our common stock has exceeded of the exercise price of the warrant for consecutive days 
accordingly  we issued or reserved for issuance pursuant to csi s outstanding in the money warrants  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock in connection with the merger  in each case reflecting the elimination of fractional shares that were cashed out in accordance with the merger agreement 
based on the closing price of per share of our common stock on the nasdaq capital market on october   the last trading day before the effectiveness of the reverse stock split and the closing of the merger  the aggregate value of our common stock issued in connection with the merger was approximately immediately prior the merger  the investors in csi s capital raise described below under csi pre merger capital raise acquired the remaining million principal amount of secured convertible notes  and all million of csi s secured convertible notes converted into csi s class b common stock  which was then exchanged for shares of our common stock at the effective time of the merger 
immediately prior the merger  csi also issued additional shares of common stock which was designated as class a common stock to its then non employee directors  which along with million in cash  as payment in full for accrued directors fees for periods prior to january  prior to the merger  cdti also completed its regulation s private placement  and sold units consisting of  shares of our common stock on a post split basis and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock on a post split basis for approximately million in cash before commissions and expenses 
the warrants issued in our regulation s private placement have an exercise price of on a post split basis on a pre split basis and expire on the earlier of i october  the third anniversary of the effective time of the merger and ii the date that is days after we give notice to the warrant holder that the market value of one share of our common stock has exceeded of the exercise price of the warrant for consecutive days 
we also issued  shares and warrants to purchase an additional  shares  each on a post split basis after eliminating fractional shares  as compensation for services rendered in connection with the merger and our regulation s offering 
the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition and  as a result  our the legal acquirer consolidated financial statements are now those of csi the accounting acquirer  with the assets and liabilities  and revenues and expenses  of cdti being included effective from october   the date of the closing of the merger 
csi pre merger capital raise on june   csi entered into agreements with a group of accredited investors providing for the sale of an aggregate million of secured convertible notes 
as provided in the agreements  million of the secured convertible notes were issued by csi in four equal installments  on each of june   june   
table of contents june  and july   with the remaining million issued on october  immediately prior to the merger 
the aggregate million of secured convertible notes was converted into newly created class b common stock immediately prior to the merger such that at the effective time of the merger  this group of accredited investors received approximately of the shares of clean diesel common stock but not warrants to purchase clean diesel common stock issued to csi s stockholders in the merger

catalyst division restructuring beginning in and continuing through  csi initiated a series of restructuring activities as a result of a strategic review of our catalyst division 
these activities included reducing workforce by approximately to eliminate excess capacity  consolidating certain functions to eliminate redundancies between engineering and manufacturing  focusing its marketing and product development strategies around heavy duty diesel catalysts and existing and selected new customers in the light duty vehicle market 
the overall objectives of the restructuring activities were to lower costs and position the catalyst division to break even at lower sales and to make this division profitable 
to date  these efforts have helped enhance our ability to reduce operating losses  retain and expand existing relationships with existing customers and attract new business 
the benefits of this cost reduction were realized partially in the year ended december  and the full effect of actions taken during was realized in the year ended december  the company estimates that these efforts have reduced the cost structure of this division by approximately million on an annualized basis 
in connection with these efforts  we incurred million of severance and recapitalization charges in the year ended december  these charges primarily included charges for severance payments for headcount reduction and fees for strategic advisors 
a reconciliation of accrued severance and related expenses are as follows in thousands accrued severance at december  accrued severance expense during paid severance expense during accrued severance at december  accrued severance expense during paid severance expense during accrued severance at december  we may utilize similar measures in the future to realign our operations to further increase our operating efficiencies  which may materially affect our future operating results 
our ability to implement corresponding 
table of contents significant reductions in our costs by making significant additional structural changes in our operations in the future may be limited 
factors affecting future results the recently completed merger described above under recent developments closing of merger will have an impact on our future results as we will consolidate cdti s results of operations for periods after the effective time of the merger 
the nature of our business and  in particular  our heavy duty diesel systems division  is heavily influenced by government funding of emissions control projects and increased diesel emission control regulations 
compliance with these regulatory initiatives drives demand for our products and the timing of implementation of emission reduction projects 
notably  the retrofit applications sold in the united states by the division are generally for funded one off projects  and typical end user customers include school districts  municipalities and other fleet operators 
for example  a major project to retrofit trucks in the san francisco area ports  was implemented in late and the first half of  resulting in growth in the retrofit systems business during the first half of in addition  following the passage of the american recovery and reinvestment act of commonly referred to as the stimulus bill  government spending both federal and state increased 
as such  our heavy duty diesel systems divisions had increased revenues due to this additional funding in notably  the draft us fiscal year budget proposes elimination of epa funding under the diesel emissions reduction act dera 
if passed in current form  it would potentially have an adverse effect on retrofit system sales in and beyond 
however  funding for diesel retrofit programs in is expected to continue to accrue from funds allocated under the stimulus bill and other sources such as the funding under california s proposition b and from funding provided by the us department of transportation under its congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program 
in addition  government mandates around the world are being used increasingly to combat diesel emissions 
for example  london  uk has mandated that several heavy duty diesel vehicles entering the london lez will be required to meet certain emission standards by january we believe that approximately  such vehicles will require a retrofit emission control device installed on the vehicle by year end in anticipation and preparation for sales in the london lez in  we will incur supplier accreditation  product verification and other expenditures relating to sales and marketing activities before we record orders and start shipping products 
while we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in gaining any particular level of sales from the various funding sources  emission programs and mandates  we expect to pursue these opportunities 
the timing of these sales is uncertain and could result in fluctuations in revenue from quarter to quarter during this year and beyond 
because the customers of our catalyst division are auto makers  our business is also affected by macroeconomic factors that impact the automotive industry generally  which can result in increased or decreased purchases of vehicles  and consequently demand for our products 
the global economic crisis in the latter half of that continued through and had a negative effect on our customers in the automotive industry 
as such demand for our products  which our auto maker customers incorporate into the vehicles they sell  decreased 
in the future  if similar macroeconomic factors or other factors affect our customer base  our revenues will be similarly affected 
in addition  two auto maker customers account for a significant portion of our catalyst division revenues see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in the second half of  one of these auto makers accelerated manufacture of a vehicle that requires a catalyst product meeting a higher regulatory standard than the product currently supplied to such auto maker by our catalyst division 
although we had already commenced the necessary testing and approval processes for our products under the higher regulatory standard  such processes are not yet complete 
in february  we were informed that there will be a further delay in the completion of tests 
accordingly  we now expect lower revenues in our catalyst division through most of although we expect that sales of our catalyst products to this auto maker will resume towards the end of once we have received the necessary regulatory approvals and customer qualifications  there is no guarantee that this will occur 
in january  we began shipment of catalyst to a new automobile manufacturer 
we expect to continue shipping catalyst to this new customer during demand from this customer has not yet been fully stabilized  as it represents catalyst for a new model of automobile 
we currently anticipate that sales to this customer will partially offset the loss of sales resulting from the delayed testing described above 
in addition  one of our auto maker customers is temporarily reducing production in light of the recent earthquake and resulting tsunami in japan 
although we expect sales to this auto maker customer to return to normal levels once it is able to address the effects of the natural disaster on its operations  at this time we do not yet know what the effects of this action will be on our revenues  however we anticipate that we will begin to see some negative effects in the second quarter of our strategy is to progressively utilize the products of our catalyst division in the products of our heavy duty diesel systems division 
we anticipate that following approval by the regulatory agencies sometime in the second quarter of  our intercompany sales of catalysts will increase compared to historical levels 
while this will not 
table of contents impact our reported sales  we believe that the manufacturing gross margin associated with these sales will improve the margins of our catalyst division and hence our total gross margin 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition and as a result  our company s the legal acquirer consolidated financial statements are now those of csi the accounting acquirer  with the assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses of cdti being included in our financial statements effective from october   the date of the closing of the merger 
as such  the amounts discussed below prior to the merger are those of csi and its consolidated subsidiaries with amounts of cdti included from the date of the merger 
revenues the table below and the tables in the discussion that follow are based upon the way we analyze our business 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for additional information about our divisions 
year ended december of total of total revenue revenue change change dollars in millions heavy duty diesel systems catalyst intercompany revenue total revenue total revenue for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  revenues for our heavy duty diesel systems division for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase was due largely to an expansion of our distributor channels in the united states as well as continued benefit from funding allocated to diesel emission control under the american recovery and reinvestment act of commonly referred to as the stimulus bill  which provided customers an incentive to acquire our emission control products 
in addition  revenues for the year ended december  were adversely impacted by the global economic slowdown and the california budget crisis  resulting in a favorable year over year comparison of the year ended december  compared to the same period in revenues for the year ended december  include million from cdti s business as a result of the merger 
revenues for our catalyst division for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  sales for this division decreased year over year as a result of an automaker accelerating the manufacture of a vehicle that requires a catalyst product meeting a higher regulatory standard than the product currently supplied to the automaker by our catalyst division 
we expect revenues in the catalyst division for the first quarter of to exceed the fourth quarter of due to the shipment of catalysts to a new automotive customer that commenced in january see factors affecting future results above 
we eliminate intercompany sales by the catalyst division to our heavy duty diesel systems division in consolidation 
cost of revenues cost of revenues decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the primary reason for the decrease in costs was lower product sales volume in our catalyst division  which was partially offset by higher product sales volume in our heavy duty diesel systems division

year ended december of of revenue revenue dollars in millions heavy duty diesel systems catalyst total gross profit division calculation based on division revenue 
total based on total revenue 
gross profit remained steady at million for both the year ended december  and december  gross margin increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in gross profit in our heavy duty diesel systems division  which resulted from increased sales  was offset by a decrease in gross profit in our catalyst division 
the gross profit in our catalyst division decreased due to lower sales  which decline was partially offset by reductions in manufacturing overhead costs as well as continued improvements in efficiency following restructuring efforts in and the decrease in gross margin for our heavy duty diesel systems division is a result of changes in overall product mix  reflecting a higher proportion of sales of a lower margin product  and higher proportion of sales through a distributor who has a preferred purchasing arrangement 
under this purchase arrangement  in exchange for higher volumes  the distributor receives a lower sales price  which results in lower profit to us 
we also experienced increases in platinum group metal prices during  leading to lower margins 
we anticipate that the gross margin in this business will remain at or around current levels until we are able to offset the platinum group metal price increases in and until we start selling higher margin products in the london lez 
see factors affecting future results above 
the increase in gross margin for our catalyst division is a result of the restructuring actions taken within the catalyst division 
we expect continued benefit in the future from the restructuring  however  we expect to have downward pressure on margins until the restart of the production for one auto manufacturer and until we increase the shipment of products of our catalyst division to our heavy duty diesel systems division 
see factors affecting future results above 
operating expenses the following table shows our operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated 
year ended december of of total total revenue revenue change change dollars in millions selling  general and administrative research and development recapitalization expenses gain on sale of intellectual property severance expense total operating expenses in prior periods we presented selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses separately on our statement of operations 
beginning in the year ended december   we now combine these categories of expenses into selling  general and administrative expenses because there is considerable overlap 
table of contents between management functions pertaining to sales and marketing and general administrative duties  and as such  estimating allocation of expenses associated with these overlapping functions is not meaningful 
prior periods have been reclassified to reflect this change in presentation 
for the year ended december   operating expenses decreased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  a significant reason for the decrease in operating expenses was the recognition of a million gain in the year ended december  compared to a million gain in the year ended december   which arose from the sale of specific three way catalyst technology and intellectual property to tkk  our asian joint venture partner as described above under recent developments asian joint venture  and to a lesser extent  continued improvements in expense management as a result of the cost reduction efforts implemented as part of the catalyst division restructuring 
included in operating expenses for the year ended december  were million related to cdti s business as a result of the merger 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the reduction is primarily due to the cost reduction efforts implemented in and as part of the catalyst division restructuring 
this was partially offset by selling  general and administrative expenses of million related to cdti s business as a result of the merger 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in due to the expenditures being incurred in preparation for sales in the london lez see factors affecting future results above 
we anticipate that these expense increases will be partially offset by a decrease in expenses occurring from the efficiencies realized from the merger 
research and development expenses for the year ended december   research and development expenses decreased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to the cost reduction efforts implemented in and as part of the catalyst division restructuring 
research and development expenses in the year ended december  include million related to cdti s business as a result of the merger 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses were in the year ended december   compared to in the year ended december  we expect the research and development expense  as a percent of anticipated revenue  to continue to be similar to the year ended december  research and development expenses are expected to increase in due to the product verification expenditures being incurred in preparation for sales in the london lez as well as planned sales of products of our catalyst division to our heavy duty diesel systems division see factors affecting future results above 
recapitalization expenses for the year ended december   recapitalization expenses increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  in  these expenses represent legal and professional fees paid directly related to the merger 
in  these expenses include fees for strategic advisors in connection with the restructuring of our catalyst division as well as fees for advisors hired to assist us in our strategic review and efforts to recapitalize our company 
severance expense during the year ended december   we incurred million of severance charges 
during the year ended december   we incurred million of severance expense primarily for headcount reduction in the catalyst division described above under recent developments catalyst division restructuring

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the revenue that we generate is not sufficient to fund our operating requirements and debt servicing needs 
notably  we have suffered recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception 
our primary sources of liquidity in recent years have been asset sales  credit facilities and other borrowings and equity sales 
such sources of liquidity  however  have not been sufficient to provide us with financing necessary to sufficiently capitalize our operations  and consequently  our working capital is severely limited 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million and a working capital deficit of million 
we had million in cash and cash equivalents at december  compared to million in cash and cash equivalents at december   and total current liabilities of million at december  compared to million at december  in light of the liquidity situation  in the first quarter of  csi retained allen company llc to act as a financial advisor to csi in exploring alternatives to recapitalize csi 
during  csi took several actions to improve its liquidity 
these actions included i reduction cash used in operations through cost reductions and improved working capital management  in particular as part of the restructuring of its catalyst division see recent developments catalyst division restructuring above  but also due to implementing policies restricting travel  improving inventory management  and overall reductions in spending  ii improved operating efficiencies in light of installation of a new erp system in which lowered capital expenditures in  iii capital expenditures have been reduced to necessary maintenance and targeted investments to improve processes or products  iv additional asset sales  including the sale of the assets of applied utility systems and sale of intellectual property  v repayment of debt  including pay off of cycad group  llc  and vi entering into forbearance agreements with fifth third bank to temporarily suspend its rights under the credit facility for a period of time see description of indebtedness fifth third bank below 
notwithstanding the foregoing actions  csi s access to working capital continued to be limited and its debt service obligations and projected operating costs for exceeded its cash balance at december  in the first half of  csi continued to work on its efforts to recapitalize its business and in may  entered into the merger agreement and in june undertook the million capital raise described above under recent developments csi s pre merger capital raise  and continued to seek forbearance from its lender fifth third bank 
also  on october   csi and cdti completed the merger 
the merger was initially anticipated to provide sufficient cash to the combined company  however  unforeseen delays in completing the merger led to significantly higher transactional costs for both cdti and csi 
in addition  the anticipated reduction in catalyst sales discussed above  has resulted in lower anticipated cash inflows 
thus  our post merger company has less cash than we need to incur sales  marketing and product verification expenditures in advance of realizing sales in the london lez and expenditures needed to complete verification of certain products of our catalyst division for use in the products of our heavy duty diesel systems division 
although in february we entered into the fgi financing facility and repaid fifth third bank  our access to working capital continues to be limited and our debt service obligations and projected operating costs for exceed our cash balance at december  as a result of the preceding factors  our auditors report for fiscal includes an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
although we are working diligently to secure additional sources of debt and or equity financing  at this time no assurances can be provided that we will have sufficient cash and credit to sustain operations or that we will be successful in obtaining additional funding 
the following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended december  and year ended december change change dollars in millions cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities 
table of contents cash provided by used in operating activities our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the sale of our products and services 
our primary uses of cash for operating activities are for purchasing inventory in support of the products that it sells  personnel related expenditures  facilities costs and payments for general operating matters 
cash used in operating activities in the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million from year ended december   when our operating activities used million of cash 
this improvement was partially due to a million decrease in net loss from continuing operations in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   after giving consideration to non cash operating items  including depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  amortization of deferred financing costs  deferred income taxes  gain on sale of intellectual property  among others for both periods and non cash interest and other expenses related to the secured convertible notes in and a gain on sale of unconsolidated subsidiary in the decrease in net loss from continuing operations was due to lower operating expenses in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   as discussed above 
the change in net operating assets and liabilities was million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december  there was a million decrease in cash used related to the change in accounts receivable due to lower revenues in the last two months of as compared to the same period of there was a decrease in revenues in the last two months of as compared to at our heavy duty diesel systems division of million  which had a significant project in process at the end of there was also a decrease of million at our catalyst division  which had no sales in the last two months of to a customer that discontinued purchases of our product pending verification of our products for newer emission standards 
this was partially offset by increases in cash used related to the change in inventories and accounts payable resulting from our overall reduced sales levels at the end of as compared to as well as an increase in cash used related to the change in income taxes payable 
cash provided by investing activities our cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to asset sales and acquisitions  our investment in the asian joint venture as well as capital expenditures and other assets to support our growth plans
