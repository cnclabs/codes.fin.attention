item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item selected consolidated financial data and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
as discussed in special note regarding forward looking and cautionary statements earlier in this report  this form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements  including as a result of the risks described in the cautionary statements in item a risk factors and elsewhere in this form k  in our other filings with the sec  and in material incorporated herein and therein by reference 
we undertake no duty to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
overview we are a leading supplier of analog and mixed signal semiconductor products and were incorporated in delaware in we design  produce and market a broad range of products that are sold principally into applications within the high end consumer  industrial  computing and communications end markets 
the high end consumer market includes handheld products  tablet computers  set top boxes  digital televisions  digital video recorders and other consumer equipment 
applications for the industrial market include automated meter reading  military and aerospace  medical  security systems  automotive  industrial and home automation  and other industrial equipment 
computing product markets include desktops  notebooks  servers  graphic boards  monitors  printers  and other computer peripherals 
communications market applications include base stations  optical networks  switches and routers  wireless lan  and other communication infrastructure equipment 
our end customers are primarily original equipment manufacturers and their suppliers  including alcatel  apple  cisco  compal electronics  finisar  huawei  hewlett packard  intel  lg electronics  motorola  nokia siemens networks  opnext  phonak  quanta computer  research in motion  samsung  sanyo  and sony 
we operate our business in one enterprise wide reportable segment 
most of our sales to customers are made on the basis of individual customer purchase orders 
many customers include liberal cancellation provisions in their purchase orders 
trends within the industry toward shorter lead times and just in time deliveries have resulted in our reduced ability to predict future shipments 
as a result  we rely on orders received and shipped within the same quarter for a significant portion of our sales 
sales made directly to customers during fiscal year were of net sales 
the remaining of net sales were made through independent distributors 
our business relies on foreign based entities 
most of our outside subcontractors and suppliers  including third party foundries that supply silicon wafers  are located in foreign countries  including china  taiwan  singapore  thailand  malaysia  the philippines  germany  israel and canada 
for the fiscal year ended january   approximately of our silicon  in terms of cost of wafers purchased  was manufactured in china 
foreign sales for fiscal year constituted approximately of our net sales 
approximately of foreign sales in fiscal year were to customers located in the asia pacific region 
the remaining foreign sales were primarily to customers in europe  canada  and mexico

table of contents net sales 
net sales for fiscal year were million  an increase of from million for fiscal year while fiscal year revenue increased significantly on strengthening demand across the majority of our product lines  revenues also benefited from the impact of the addition of the full year of smi acquisition related revenues  whereas fiscal year only reflected smi acquisition related revenues for the period of december  through january  fiscal year was also impacted by deteriorating global economic conditions that resulted in a significant reduction in orders of our component products during the first half of the fiscal year 
demand and orders increased during the second half of fiscal year as business conditions began to improve 
revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal year also benefited from an extra week in the fiscal quarter 
higher revenue in the communications end market was attributed to the impact of the addition of g communications infrastructure product revenues resulting from the smi acquisition in our advanced communications sensing product group and strengthening demand for our topsync products in the advanced communications sensing product line 
higher revenues in the high end consumer end market were driven by strengthening demand for protection products 
higher computing revenues were driven by strengthening demand for protection products offsetting a decline in revenues in our power management product group attributed to its strategic exit from lower margin segments of the computing segment 
within the industrial category  higher revenue was attributed to the addition of military revenues resulting from the smi acquisition in our microwave and high reliability product group and strengthening industrial medical and automated test equipment demand in the advanced communications sensing product group 
gross profit 
gross profit was million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
our gross margin was for fiscal year  up from in fiscal year gross profit margins for fiscal year were positively impacted by product revenue mix attributed to the higher mix of communications and industrial revenues and a lower mix of high end consumer and computing revenues relative to fiscal year the contribution of new product revenue from our power management product line also helped fiscal year gross margins

approximately million of transaction and integration expenses attributed to the acquisition of smi were recorded in fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal years and include approximately million and million net of insurance recoveries of million  respectively  for legal and other professional services incurred in connection with matters related to our historical stock option practices  including the government inquiries  the related litigation  and other associated matters 
on december   we entered into an agreement in principle to settle the class action lawsuit for million 
as a result of this agreement we recorded an additional charge of million in fiscal to increase our total accrued liability for this matter to million 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for additional information regarding expenses related to the class action lawsuit and historical stock option matters 
stock based compensation expense was million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the year over year increase in equity compensation was principally driven by the impact of inducement and replacement awards issued to employees that joined the company as a result of the smi acquisition  higher levels of anticipated vesting for performance awards and the impact of a higher stock price on awards accounted for as liabilities 
product development and engineering expenses product development and engineering expenses for fiscal years and were million and million  respectively or an increase of 
the increase in fiscal year is principally driven by the impact of the additional product development and engineering expenses resulting from the acquisition of smi and a million increase in stock based compensation expense which includes the impact of inducement and replacement awards issued to employees that joined the company as a result of the smi acquisition 

table of contents intangible amortization intangible amortization  which reflects amortization costs associated with acquired intangibles  increased by million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year as a result of the amortization of intangibles associated with our acquisition of smi in the fourth quarter of fiscal year interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net was  for fiscal year  down from million in fiscal year for fiscal years and  the primary source of income was interest from investments and secondarily  gain loss from foreign currency transactions  gain loss on sale of assets  and insurance proceeds recorded as other income 
interest income decreased in fiscal year as a result of the continued environment of low interest rates and the focus on protecting principal by limiting the investment of new and maturing funds to the higher quality yet lower yielding investments 
provision for taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year the effective tax rates for fiscal year and fiscal year were and  respectively 
the rate for fiscal year reflects the impact of favorable trends in our regional mix of income 
in addition to favorable trends in regional revenue distribution  other key drivers for our favorable regional mix of income in fiscal year were high levels of expense related to the class action lawsuit  including the additional million of expense that was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year to reflect the agreement in principle to settle the class action lawsuit and higher levels of equity compensation expense 
we expect our regional income trends to remain favorable 
however  certain items which occurred in fiscal year  including the expense activity related to the agreement to settle the class action lawsuit  are not expected to recur in fiscal year in fiscal year  our tax provision benefited from a net reduction to our valuation allowance of million 
this net reduction was primarily the result of changes to tax law enacted by the state of california in the third quarter of fiscal year the benefit of this reduction to our valuation allowance was partially offset by a  reduction to certain deferred tax assets to reflect lower anticipated future benefits as a result of these california tax law changes 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  in connection with the pending acquisition of smi  we changed our prior assertions regarding the amount of foreign subsidiary earnings that were considered to be permanently reinvested offshore 
this change in assertion resulted in a million increase in the tax provision for the period ended october  the impact of this change in assertion was partially offset by the release of million of valuation allowances 
the released valuation allowances were related to research and development credits that we did not expect to be able to utilize as a result of expectations of insufficient generation of domestic income 
with the anticipated repatriation of foreign subsidiary earnings  these utilization concerns were no longer applicable 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  an  adjustment was recorded to reflect higher expected tax benefits from stock based compensation

net sales for fiscal year were million  a decrease of from million for fiscal year while fiscal year revenue decreased modestly  revenue during the first half of fiscal year was million  down when compared to the first half of fiscal year deteriorating global economic conditions resulted in reduced demand for our customer s end products  which caused a severe reduction in orders of our component products during the first half of fiscal year demand and orders increased during the second half of fiscal year as business conditions began to improve 
revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal year also benefited from an extra week in the fiscal quarter and from million of revenue attributable to the acquisition of smi which was generated during the period december  through january  
table of contents higher revenue in the communications end market was driven by higher unit volumes of advanced communications sensing products  including the benefits from the unit volumes attributable to the acquired smi business  and power management products 
higher revenues in the high end consumer end market were driven by strengthening demand for protection products 
the reduction in computing revenues was attributed to the overall softness in the macro economy and the strategy to exit lower margin areas of the computing end market 
within the industrial category  lower revenue was attributed to the overall softness in the macro economy and the impact of a slowdown in military funding which impacted the microwave and high reliability product group

the year over year increase in equity compensation was principally driven by the impact of inducement and replacement awards issued to employees that joined the company as a result of the smi acquisition 
this was partially offset by a reduction in stock based compensation in fiscal year which benefited from the reversal of million of expense attributable to performance grants that are not expected to vest 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year includes approximately million of transaction and integration expenses attributed to the acquisition of smi 
selling  general administrative expenses were partially offset by an insurance recovery in the amount of approximately million related to the fire at our reynosa  mexico manufacturing facility in fiscal year these expenses were partially offset by reduced selling and marketing expenses

interest income decreased in fiscal year as a result of the continued environment of low interest rates and the focus on protecting principal by limiting the investment of new and maturing funds to the higher quality yet lower yielding investments 
the year over year decrease in interest income was partially mitigated by net gains related to foreign currency transactions and sale of assets and the receipt of insurance property claims recorded as other income 
provision for taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year the effective tax rates for fiscal year and fiscal year were and  respectively 
the dramatic increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year resulted from the change in management s assertions regarding the amount of foreign subsidiary earnings that are considered to be permanently reinvested offshore  in connection with the then pending acquisition of smi 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements depend on a variety of factors  including but not limited to  the rate of increase or decrease in our existing business base  the success  timing and amount of investment required to bring new products to market  revenue growth or decline  and potential acquisitions 
we believe that we have the financial resources necessary to meet business requirements for the next months  including funds needed for working capital requirements 
as of january   our total shareholders equity was million 
at that date we also had approximately million in cash and short term investments  as well as million in long term investments 
we have no outstanding debt 
our primary sources and uses of cash during the comparative fiscal years are presented below fiscal years ended in millions january  january  january  sources of cash operating activities  including working capital changes proceeds from exercise of compensatory stock plans  including tax benefits total sources of cash uses of cash capital expenditures  net of sale proceeds excluding land sale net increase decrease in investments acquisition  net of cash acquired stock repurchases repayment of long term debt total uses of cash net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents we incur significant expenditures in order to fund the development  design  and manufacture of new products 
we intend to continue to focus on those areas that have shown potential for viable and profitable market opportunities  which may require additional investment in equipment and will require continued  and perhaps additional  investment in design and application engineers aimed at developing new products 
certain of these expenditures  particularly the addition of design engineers  do not generate significant payback in the short term 
we plan to finance these expenditures with cash generated by our operations and our existing cash balances 
a meaningful portion of our capital resources  and the liquidity they represent  are held by our foreign subsidiaries 
as of january   our foreign subsidiaries held approximately million of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments compared to million at january  if we needed these funds for investment in domestic operations  any repatriation  such as that which occurred in fiscal year to partially fund the acquisition of smi  could result in increased tax liabilities 
one of our primary goals is to constantly improve the cash flows from our existing business activities 
our cash  cash equivalents and investments noted above  when combined with the lack of any outstanding debt obligations  give us the flexibility to leverage our free cash flow to return value to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases while also pursuing business improvement opportunities 

table of contents additionally  we will continue to seek to maintain and improve our existing business performance with necessary capital expenditures and  potentially  acquisitions that may further improve our base business with prospects of a proper return 
acquisitions might be made for either cash or stock consideration  or a combination of both 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to net income adjusted by non cash items plus fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities 
non cash adjustments include deferred income taxes  stock based compensation expense  depreciation  amortization of intangible assets  and tax benefits from stock based awards 
depreciation and amortization expense was million and million during fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase is primarily attributable to the increase in intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of smi and the significant increase in capital expenditures that were made in fiscal year to support the growth of the business 
stock based compensation was million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the million increase is attributable to mark to market adjustments for awards accounted for as liabilities  higher expected vesting levels for awards with performance vesting conditions and a full year of expense for inducement and replacement awards issued to employees that joined the company as a result of the acquisition of smi 
changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash on a net basis in fiscal year  driven primarily by the following accounts receivable increased by million due to higher revenue inventory increased by million to support increases in demand prepaid expenses and other assets increased by million primarily as a result of the payment of income taxes related to the integration of smi into our operating structure accrued liabilities increased by million primarily due to a million supplemental accrual related to the agreement in principle to settle the stock option litigation and an increase in the company s annual bonus program accrual due to higher headcount levels and higher achievement of performance goals accounts payable increased by million due to higher operating expenses and capital expenditures required to support the overall increase in revenue and related business activities as discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report  the company entered into an agreement in principle to settle all claims asserted against all defendants in the putative class action concerning the company s historical stock option accounting practices 
we expect to make a million payment related to this matter in the first or second quarter of fiscal year the million payment will be paid from domestic cash reserves 
we do not expect this payment to impair our ability to meet business requirements during the next months 
investing activities cash provided used in investing activities is primarily attributable to capital expenditures  purchases of investments  and proceeds from the sales maturities of investments 
capital expenditures were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year the increase in capital expenditures reflects our efforts to enhance and expand our test capacity  support engineering and manufacturing functions  and renovate our facilities 
in fiscal year  we expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately million to further enhance and expand our test and production capacity and engineering development efforts 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities is primarily attributable to the proceeds from stock option exercises offset by the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program  the payment of statutory tax withholding obligations related to the vesting of restricted stock  and stock repurchases 
for fiscal year  cash collected directly from grantee exercises of stock options was million compared with million in fiscal year we do not directly control the timing of the exercise of vested stock options by our grantees 
such exercises are decisions made by those grantees and are influenced most directly by the level of our stock price and  indirectly  by other considerations of those grantees 
such proceeds are difficult to forecast 
while the level of such cash inflow to us is subject to several factors which are not within our control  we believe that such proceeds will remain an important secondary source of cash after cash flow from operations 
we currently have in effect a stock repurchase program 
this program represents one of our principal efforts to return value to our shareholders 
in fiscal year  we repurchased  shares under this program for million 
in addition to the direct 
table of contents repurchase activity   shares valued at million were withheld in connection with the vesting of restricted stock to cover statutory tax withholding obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as those arrangements are defined by the sec  that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
we do not have any unconsolidated subsidiaries or affiliated entities 
we have no special purpose or limited purpose entities that provide off balance sheet financing  liquidity or market or credit risk support 
we do not engage in leasing  hedging  research and development services  or other relationships that expose us to liability that is not reflected on the face of the financial statements 
noted below under contractual obligations are various commitments we have associated with our business  such as lease commitments and open purchase obligations  which are not recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet because we have not yet received the related goods or services as of january  contractual obligations presented below is a summary of our contractual obligations as of january  payments due by period in thousands less than year years years after years total operating leases open capital purchase commitments other open purchase commitments other vendor commitments deferred compensation other long term liabilities total contractual cash obligations capital purchase commitments  other open purchase commitments and other vendor commitments are for the purchase of plant  equipment  raw material  supplies and services 
they are not recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet as of january   as we have not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property 
we maintain a deferred compensation plan for certain officers and key executives that allows participants to defer a portion of their compensation for future distribution at various times permitted by the plan 
our liability for deferred compensation under this plan was million as of january  and million as of january   and is included in accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities on the balance sheet and in the table above 
the plan provides for a discretionary company match up to a defined portion of the employee s deferral  with any match subject to a vesting period 
we have purchased whole life insurance on the lives of some of our current and former deferred compensation plan participants 
this company owned life insurance is held in a grantor trust and is intended to cover a majority of our costs of the deferred compensation plan 
the cash surrender value of our company owned life insurance was million as of january  and million as of january   and is included in other assets 
we have million of accrued taxes for uncertain tax positions 
we believe that it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately million within twelve months as a result of expiring statutes 
inflation inflationary factors have not had a significant effect on our performance over the past several years 
a significant increase in inflation would affect our future performance 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our financial statements  we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events  and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared 
on a regular basis  management reviews 
table of contents the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  included in item  of this report on form k 
we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
accounting for temporary and long term investments our temporary and long term investments consist of government  corporate obligations and bank time deposits 
temporary investments mature within twelve months of the balance sheet date 
long term investments have maturities in excess of one year from the date of the balance sheet 
we classify our investments as available for sale because we expect to possibly sell some securities prior to maturity 
we include any unrealized gain or loss  net of tax  in the comprehensive income portion of our consolidated statements of stockholders equity 
after determining the fair value of our available for sale investments  unrealized gains or losses on these investments are recorded to other comprehensive income  until either the investment is sold or we determine that a decline in value is other than temporary 
determining whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary requires management judgment based on the specific facts and circumstances of each investment 
for investments in debt instruments  these judgments primarily consider the financial condition and liquidity of the issuer  the issuer s credit rating  and any specific events that may cause us to believe that the debt instrument will not mature and be paid in full  and our ability and intent to hold the investment to maturity 
if management decides not to hold an investment until maturity  it may result in the recognition of an other than temporary impairment 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
if we are aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record an allowance to reduce the net receivable to the amount we reasonably believe we will be able to collect from the customer 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  the current business environment  the size and number of certain large accounts and our historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if economic conditions worsen  additional allowances may be required in the future 
revenue and cost of sales we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable 
product design and engineering revenue is recognized during the period in which services are performed 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
we base these estimates on historical sales returns and other known factors 
actual returns could be different from our estimates and current provisions for sales returns and allowances  resulting in future charges to earnings 
we defer revenue recognition on shipment of products to certain customers  principally distributors  under agreements which provide for limited pricing credits or product return privileges  until these products are sold through to end users or the return privileges lapse 
for sales subject to certain pricing credits or return privileges  the amount of future pricing credits or inventory returns cannot be reasonably estimated given the relatively long period in which a particular product may be held by the customer 
therefore  we have concluded that sales to customers under these agreements are not fixed and determinable at the date of the sale and revenue recognition has been deferred 
we estimate the deferred gross margin on these sales by applying an average gross profit margin to the actual gross sales 
the average gross profit margin is calculated for each category of material using current standard costs 
the deferred gross margin does not include any adjustments for sales returns 
the estimated deferred gross margin on these sales  where there are no outstanding receivables  is recorded on the balance sheet under the heading of deferred revenue 
there were no significant impairments of deferred cost of sales in fiscal year or fiscal year 
table of contents the following table summarizes the deferred net revenue balance deferred revenue in thousands january  january  deferred revenue deferred cost of revenue deferred revenue  net deferred product design and engineering revenue total deferred revenue inventory valuation our inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and consist of materials  labor and overhead 
we determine the cost of inventory by the first in  first out method 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analyses of sales levels by product and projections of future demand 
in order to state our inventory at lower of cost or market  we maintain specific reserves against our inventory which serve to write down our inventories to a new cost basis 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  a write down of inventory may be required  and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period the revision is made 
contingencies and litigation we are involved in various disputes and litigation matters as a claimant and as defendant 
we record any amounts recovered in these matters when collection is certain 
we record liabilities for claims against us when the losses are probable and reasonably estimable 
any amounts recorded are based on reviews by outside counsel  in house counsel and management 
actual results may differ from estimates 
stock based compensation we measure compensation cost for all share based payments including stock options at fair value using a valuation model  which considers  among other things  estimates and assumptions on the rate of forfeiture  expected life of options and stock price volatility 
if any of the assumptions used in the valuation model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period and actual results may differ from estimates 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets we test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
the value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  could be impacted by future adverse changes such as i any future declines in our operating results  ii a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks  including the valuation of our common stock  iii a significant slowdown in the worldwide economy and the semiconductor industry or iv any failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results 
our goodwill is assigned to the advanced communication and sensing products reporting unit 
for our annual impairment review  we primarily use a multi period excess earnings approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of the assets 
our assumptions incorporate judgments as to the price received to sell a reporting unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
considering the integration of our operations  we have assumed that the highest and best use of a reporting unit follows an in use valuation premise 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation 
the estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business 
it is possible  however  that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analysis  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur impairment charges in a future period 
upon completing step of our impairment test for goodwill  prepared in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we concluded that the fair value of the reporting unit was significantly above its carrying value 
our analysis included sensitivity analysis of key assumptions such as a increase in the weighted average cost of capital  a increase in the effective tax rate or a decline in our compound annual growth rate noting the fair value of the reporting unit would pass step we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment  such as reductions in demand or significant economic slowdowns in the semiconductor industry  are present 
reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying value of an asset is impaired  based on comparisons to undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if this comparison indicates that there is impairment  the impaired asset is written down to fair value  which is typically calculated using 
table of contents i quoted market prices and or ii discounted expected future cash flows utilizing a discount rate 
impairment is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
generally  to the extent we change a valuation allowance  the change is recorded through the tax provision in the statement of operations 
management periodically evaluates our deferred tax assets to assess whether it is likely that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is required  we consider projected taxable income 
the most significant assumptions used in preparing projections of taxable income include forecasting the levels of income by region and the amount of deductible stock based compensation 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant management estimates are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax impact is uncertain 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period of change 
although we believe the estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation  a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 
the income tax effects of share based payments are recognized for financial reporting purposes only if such awards are expected to result in a tax deduction 
we do not recognize a deferred tax asset for an excess tax benefit that is  a tax benefit that exceeds the amount of compensation cost recognized for the award for financial reporting purposes that has not been realized 
in determining when an excess tax benefit is realized  we have elected to follow the ordering provision of the tax law 
in addition to the risks to the effective tax rate discussed above  the effective tax rate reflected in forward looking statements is based on current enacted tax law 
significant changes in enacted tax law could materially affect these estimates 
in general  the amount of taxes we pay will differ from our reported tax provision as a result of differences between accounting for income under us gaap and accounting for taxable income 
typical book tax differences include expense related to equity compensation  deemed dividends  depreciation  litigation expense and amortization of intangible assets 
as a result of these book tax differences  our tax payments are expected to exceed our tax provision during the next three years 
for intra entity differences between the tax basis of an asset in the buyer s tax jurisdiction and their cost as reported in the consolidated financial statements  we do not recognize a deferred tax asset 
income taxes paid on intra entity profits on assets remaining within the group are accounted for as prepaid taxes

this asu will be effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved beginning in our second quarter of fiscal year we do not expect the adoption of this asu to have a significant effect to our consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to a variety of market risks  such as the foreign exchange and interest rate risks that are detailed below 
many of the factors that can impact our market risk are external to the company  and so we are unable to fully predict them 
market conditions current global economic conditions pose a risk to the overall economy as consumers and businesses may defer purchases in response to the uncertainty around tighter credit and negative financial news 
these conditions have historically resulted in periods where demand for our products is reduced 
in addition to risks associated with global economic conditions  demand for our products could be different from our expectations due to customer acceptance of our products  changes in customer order patterns  including order cancellations  and changes in the level of inventory held by vendors 
commodity risk we are subject to risk from fluctuating market prices of certain commodity raw materials  particularly gold  that are incorporated into our end products or used by our suppliers to process our end products 
increased commodity prices are passed on to us in the form of higher prices from our suppliers  either in the form of general price increases or a commodity surcharge 
although we generally deal with our suppliers on a purchase order basis rather than on a long term contract basis  we generally attempt to obtain firm pricing for volumes consistent with planned production 
our gross margins may decline if we are not able to increase selling prices of our products or obtain manufacturing efficiencies to offset the increased cost 
we do not enter into formal hedging arrangements to mitigate against commodity risk 
foreign currency risk as a global enterprise  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and we could experience foreign currency exchange gains or losses 
historically  we have not considered our foreign currency exposure to be material 
therefore  we have not utilized foreign currency hedging products to mitigate foreign currency risks 
our foreign currency exposures may increase over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows 
changes in the rates could have an adverse impact upon our financial results 
a relatively small amount of our monetary assets and liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies  principally the swiss franc  mexican peso  british pound sterling and the euro 
fluctuations in these currencies relative to the united states dollar will result in transaction gains or losses included in net earnings 
all of our foreign sales  which amounted to million in fiscal year  are denominated in united states dollars 
currency exchange rate fluctuations in foreign countries where we do business could harm our business by resulting in pricing that is not competitive with prices denominated in local currencies 
for fiscal year  we spent approximately million in british pound sterling  million in swiss francs  million in euros and million in mexican pesos for operating expenses 
in general  we purchase foreign currencies on a spot basis as needed to fund local operations 
as of january   we did not hold a significant amount of foreign currency 
if rates of these foreign currencies were to strengthen or weaken relative to the us dollar  we would realize gains or losses in converting these funds back into us dollars 
interest rate and market risk as of january   we had no long term debt outstanding 
we do not currently hedge any potential interest rate exposure 
interest rates affect our return on excess cash and investments 
as of january   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of temporary and long term investments 
a majority of our cash and cash equivalents and investments generate interest income based on prevailing interest rates 
investments and cash and cash equivalents generated interest income of million in fiscal year a significant change in interest rates would impact the amount of interest income generated from our cash and investments 
it would also impact the market value of our investments 
our investments are subject to market risks  primarily interest rate and credit risk 
our investments are managed by a limited number of outside professional managers following investment guidelines set by us 
such guidelines prescribe credit quality  permissible investments  diversification  and duration restrictions 
these restrictions are intended to limit risk by restricting our investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively short term durations 
our investment strategy limits investment of new funds and maturing securities to us treasury  federal agency securities  high quality money market funds and time deposits with our principal commercial banks
