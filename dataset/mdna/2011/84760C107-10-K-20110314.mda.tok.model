table of contents revenue and gross margin revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of as compared with million for the year ended december  this increase is mainly due to increased lead management lm disposables revenue and increased equipment rental revenue  offset by a decline in vascular intervention vi disposables revenue compared with the prior year 
our product mix remained stable year over year  with disposables products generating of revenue  service and other revenue generating and revenue from laser sales and rentals at of total revenue in both years 
vi revenue  which includes products used in both the peripheral and coronary vascular systems  decreased from to vi sales include three product categories atherectomy  which decreased  crossing solutions  which decreased  and thrombectomy  which decreased  all compared with the decline in atherectomy revenue was due primarily to a decrease in sales of our turbo elite products  as a result of a challenging economic environment  disruption associated with the elimination and realignment of certain sales territories in the second half of and ongoing competitive product pressures 
these declines were partially offset by sales of our turbo tandem product which was launched in march  which generated revenue of million in we believe the decrease in crossing solutions product sales is primarily due to the competitive environment  with the introduction by competitors of alternative crossing solutions products in late we believe the decline in thrombectomy revenue is partially due to ordering patterns adversely impacted as a result of the quickcat recall announced in july for our vi business  we have six anticipated growth drivers for and beyond i we intend to improve our sales execution  ii we intend to leverage the new reimbursement changes for  including the newly established reimbursement for office based procedures  iii we anticipate gaining product approval in japan for our turbo elite and quick cross family of products  iv we hope to gain fda approval in late for a product line extension to our turbo tandem  v we are pursuing a us indication for thromcat xt  our peripheral thrombectomy product we currently sell in europe  and vi we anticipate receiving fda approval to begin our excite in stent restenosis isr clinical trial 
lm revenue grew in as compared with we continue to believe our lm revenue is increasing primarily as a result of clinical data supporting the safety and efficacy of removing pacemaker and defibrillator leads  including results from the four year lead extraction in contemporary settings lexicon study published in the february  issue of the journal of the american college of cardiology  expanded guidelines set forth by the heart rhythm society for lead extractions  and our expanded sales organization  which was initially established in for our lead management business  we have five anticipated growth drivers in and beyond i we intend to support training and education to more comprehensively manage non functional or redundant pacemaker and defibrillator leads and scenarios where venous occlusion prevents implant of an additional lead  ii we intend to offer more simulation events in to meet a growing demand  as simulation is proving to be an excellent training platform  iii we intend to continue to build our fellows program  iv we anticipate product approval for our new  advanced laser sheath in late in europe  and v we anticipate approval for our lld product in japan 
laser equipment revenue was million and million for and  respectively 
rental revenue increased in as compared with the prior year 
this increase is due primarily to the increase in our installed rental base of laser systems  which increased to at december  from at december   as well as our focus on converting under performing cap free fee per procedure lasers to straight rentals 
equipment sales revenue  which is included in laser equipment revenue  decreased from we sold laser systems in each of and  however  our average sales price of laser systems decreased slightly in compared with the prior year primarily due to the mix of new vs 
remanufactured systems sales 
service and other 
table of contents revenue increased  to million in from million in  due primarily to our increased installed base of laser systems 
we placed laser systems with new customers during compared with during the prior year 
of those new laser placements  laser systems were transfers from the existing installed base in compared with transfers in in the past two years  we have placed more focus on redeploying laser systems from hospitals with low laser based catheter utilization to hospitals where we believe utilization will be higher  in order to increase productivity per laser system 
both our focus on redeploying laser systems and our emphasis on increasing sales to existing accounts have resulted in fewer net new placements as compared with year ago periods  which was anticipated 
this brings our worldwide installed base of laser systems to in the us at december  on a geographic basis  revenue in the united states was million in  an increase of from the prior year 
international revenue totaled million  a decrease of from  due in part to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
gross margin in and was 
gross margin was favorably impacted by the year over year change in product mix  as the year over year revenue increase was primarily in higher margin disposable products 
laser margins in were also slightly higher than laser margins in the prior year  due primarily to an increase in straight rentals and a decrease in cap free fee per procedure programs 
however  these improvements in gross margin were offset by the impact of the voluntary product recall and related expenses for product replacement of the quickcat catheter 
cost of products sold included a million charge related to the recall  of which million was related to the costs associated with the return and replacement of product and million was related to the disposal and write off of inventory 
operating expenses operating expenses of million in decreased from million in operating expenses in and include a number of special items which are separately disclosed components within operating expenses in our statement of operations 
in  these special items totaled million  compared with million in  and they are further described below 
in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  and research  development and other technology decreased as compared with the prior year 
operating expenses represented of total revenue in as compared with of total revenue in over the past twelve months  our focus on productivity and expense management activities  along with the elimination of certain positions within the company to streamline operations  have contributed to the reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue as compared with the prior year 
selling  general and administrative 
year over year fluctuations in selling  general and administrative expenses included marketing and selling expenses decreased year over year  with decreases in us field sales and marketing costs offset by increases in international sales and marketing  due to an increase in staffing within our international sales organization 
general and administrative expenses decreased  with year over year decreases in regulatory compliance outside consulting costs partially offset by increases in personnel and other miscellaneous expenses 
research and development 
research  development and other technology expenses of approximately million in decreased compared with  and in and represented of revenue 
we believe research and development investments are critical to increasing our revenue growth rate 
as a result  we plan 
table of contents to increase our activities in this area which will likely result in increased research and development investments as a percentage of revenue 
costs included within research  development and other technology expenses are product costs  clinical studies costs and royalty costs associated with various license agreements with third party licensors 
fluctuations in these costs are as follows product development and related regulatory costs increased approximately million compared with primarily related to an increase in outside consulting costs to support our regulatory affairs activities 
clinical studies expense decreased by approximately million due to the conclusion of several studies that were ongoing in the prior year 
we expect these costs to increase in upon initiation of excite isr  the randomized clinical trial related to the treatment of isr  which is subject to approval by the fda and which we anticipate starting in the second quarter 
royalty expenses increased by approximately million due to higher sales of products incorporating technology that we license 
federal investigation legal and accrued indemnification costs 
in the third quarter of  three former employees with whom we have indemnification obligations were indicted on charges related to the subjects of a federal investigation  which significantly increased the likelihood that the former employees future defense costs will be substantial and ongoing  and that our indemnification obligations to these employees will exceed the limits of our insurance coverage 
therefore  at september   we recorded a million charge to accrue the low end of our estimate of the range of our contingent liability under the indemnification obligations 
we currently estimate that the legal fees in this matter for the federal district court stage of these proceedings could range from million to million through trial and that these costs would be paid over the course of the court proceedings 
we developed the estimate with the assistance of outside legal counsel familiar with court proceedings similar in nature to the proceedings related to our indemnification obligations 
the actual expenses may be higher or lower than the estimate depending upon final resolution of the matter 
as of december   we have received invoices for such legal fees and related costs of million related to the former employees defense 
see note  commitments and contingencies  of the consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report for further discussion of this matter 
in addition  we incurred approximately million of legal costs related to the conclusion of the federal investigation in legal and other expenses related to the federal investigation were approximately million in federal investigation settlement 
in december  we reached a resolution with the federal government regarding the previously disclosed federal investigation 
as part of the resolution  we entered into a non prosecution agreement with the department of justice doj and we agreed to a forfeiture of  and the doj has agreed not to prosecute the company in return for compliance with the terms of the agreement 
in addition  we entered into a civil settlement agreement with the doj and the office of inspector general oig of the united states department of health and human services  pursuant to which we settled civil and administrative claims related to the federal investigation for a cash payment to the united states government of million  without any admission of wrongdoing by the company 
see further discussion of this matter in note  commitments and contingencies  of the consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report 
employee termination and lease abandonment costs 
in the third quarter of  we terminated employees  primarily within the vascular intervention sales organization  as a result of a strategic re alignment of certain sales territories designed to improve sales productivity 
as a result  we recorded severance obligations totaling million in the third quarter of effective november   mr 
geisenheimer retired from his positions as chairman  president  and chief executive officer 
in connection with mr 
geisenheimer s retirement 
table of contents and release of claims  the company paid to mr 
geisenheimer a lump sum payment of million  equal to one year s salary  which represents the amount payable under mr 
geisenheimer s employment agreement in connection with his termination of employment 
in addition  outstanding stock options held by mr 
geisenheimer covering  shares of the company s common stock became fully vested in accordance with their terms  resulting in non cash stock compensation expense of million 
these amounts  along with certain health insurance premiums  were recorded in the three months ended december  in the second and third quarters of  we eliminated certain positions in order to streamline operations 
as a result  we recorded severance obligations totaling  for the year ended december  in addition  we recorded a charge for remaining lease obligations in the amount of  for a portion of a leased facility that is no longer being utilized 
asset impairment charge 
in the third quarter of  we wrote off a capital project in process which is now no longer expected to be completed and utilized  due to a recent epa ruling which effectively limited the useful life of the asset 
litigation settlement 
the million included in this line item in represent royalties related to a patent license agreement  which was executed and paid in december discontinuation costs safe cross product line 
in the third quarter of  we discontinued the marketing and sales of the safe cross product line  which was acquired from knc in may the million charge includes a patent impairment charge in the amount of million  impairment of long lived assets in the amount of million  inventory write offs of million and an amount in consideration of estimated remaining obligations to knc and customers of million 
other income expense interest income  net 
interest income decreased to million in from million in the decrease in interest income in is due primarily to lower interest rates on our invested balances and a lower investment portfolio balance 
loss on sale of auction rate securities 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold two of our auction rate securities at and of par  respectively 
the amounts recorded represent the realized loss on the sale of these securities  which were recorded on our balance sheet at of par at the date of sale 
other than temporary impairment of auction rate securities 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that our remaining auction rate securities were other than temporarily impaired  due to a change by management regarding our intent to hold such investments until a full recovery of their par value 
the million recorded represents the impairment calculated by an independent consultant 
see further discussion of our auction rate securities in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report 
loss before income taxes pre tax loss for the year ended december  was million  compared with a pre tax loss of million for the year ended december  the current year results included million of special items and the prior year results included million of special items  in addition to million of losses related to our auction rate securities  as described above 

table of contents income tax expense for the year ended december   we increased to our valuation allowance against our us deferred tax asset 
the effect of the valuation allowance adjustment was to increase the company s provision for income taxes by million for the year ended december  recent events  primarily the third quarter indictment of former employees  the related million accrual for indemnification costs for these employees  and the possibility that such costs could exceed the estimated accrual  caused us to conclude that we no longer meet the accounting criteria for recognizing a portion of our deferred tax asset 
see note  income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion

table of contents revenue and gross margin revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of as compared with million for the year ended december  this increase was mainly attributable to a increase in disposable products revenue  which consists of single use catheter products  and a increase in service and other revenue  partially offset by a decrease in laser revenue 
our product mix changed slightly year over year  with of revenue coming from disposables in compared with from disposables in service and other revenue represented of total revenue in as compared with of revenue in revenue from laser sales and rentals decreased to of total revenue in from of total revenue in we separate our disposable products revenue into two separate categories vascular intervention vi and lead management lm 
for the year ended december   our vi revenue totaled million of our disposable products revenue and our lm revenue totaled million of our disposable products revenue 
for  our vi revenue totaled million of our disposable products revenue and our lm revenue totaled million of our disposable products revenue 
vi revenue  which includes products used in both the peripheral and coronary vascular systems  grew from to the increased vi revenue is due to unit volume increases in addition to price increases 
approximately one half of the increase was due to price increases implemented at the beginning of vi sales include three product categories atherectomy  which decreased  crossing solutions  which increased  and thrombectomy  which increased  all compared with we believe the decrease in atherectomy product sales is primarily due to the current competitive environment in peripheral atherectomy procedures  particularly those performed below the knee 
the increase in thrombectomy was primarily due to the first full year of revenue from the endovascular product lines acquired from kensey nash corporation in may  which totaled million in compared with million from may to december  lm revenue grew in as compared with we believe our lm revenue increased primarily as a result of our expanded sales organization  which was initially established in  clinical data supporting the safety and efficacy of removing pacemaker and defibrillator leads  including results from the four year lead extraction in contemporary settings lexicon study published in the february  issue of the journal of the american college of cardiology  and expanded guidelines set forth by the heart rhythm society for lead extractions 
laser revenue was million and million for and  respectively 
equipment sales revenue  which is included in laser revenue  decreased from we sold fourteen laser systems in twelve from inventory  two rental conversions as compared with thirty two laser systems twenty six from inventory  six rental conversions in the prior year 
we believe the decline in laser sales was due primarily to reduced capital budgets at hospitals in light of current economic conditions 
rental revenue increased in as compared with the prior year 
this increase is due primarily to the increase in our installed rental base of laser systems  which increased from at december  to at december   as well as our focus on converting under performing cap free lasers to straight rentals 
service and other revenue increased  to million in from million in  due primarily to our increased installed base of laser systems 
we placed laser systems with new customers during compared with during the prior year 
of those new laser placements  laser systems were transfers from the existing installed base in compared with transfers in in recent quarters  we have placed more focus on redeploying laser systems from hospitals with low laser based catheter utilization to hospitals where we believe utilization will be higher  in order to increase productivity per laser system 
both our focus on redeploying laser systems and our emphasis on increasing sales to existing accounts have resulted in fewer net new placements as compared with year ago periods  which was anticipated 
this brings our worldwide installed base of laser systems to in the us at december  
table of contents on a geographic basis  revenue in the united states was million in  an increase of from the prior year 
international revenue totaled million  an increase of from in europe and the middle east emea  the increase in international revenue was led by sales of thrombectomy products acquired in may  which increased to million in from million in the period from may to december  as well as an increase in both vi and lm product sales 
in addition  sales to the asia pacific latin america sector apla increased year over year  with increases across all product lines  particularly in laser sales 
gross margin in was  a decrease of less than one percentage point as compared with in the gross margin decline was due primarily to a less favorable margin mix of product revenues within vi disposable product sales 
in  as compared with  we experienced growth in our non laser disposables  including support catheters and thrombectomy products  which carry lower gross margins than our laser based catheters 
additionally  laser margins were lower than in the previous year due primarily to fewer laser sales  which carry higher margins than laser rentals  as compared with the year ago period

these costs include salaries and related taxes  recruiting  and travel costs 
increased incentive compensation of approximately million  which is mainly due to the increase in revenues and additional employees 
increased marketing expenses of approximately million  due primarily to new product launches and anticipated new product launches 
approximately million in increased sales related costs for our international operations  due primarily to incremental expenses for sales and marketing activities related to the acquired kensey nash products in europe  acquired in may  in addition to higher sales and commissions expense due to the increase in revenues

fluctuations in these costs are as follows personnel related costs and outside contractor services increased by million due primarily to a year over year increase in headcount of three employees 
these costs include salaries and related taxes  recruiting  and travel costs 
clinical studies expenses decreased approximately million as compared with the prior year  due in part to the timing of completion of certain clinical studies 
product development costs increased by approximately million compared with related to the design of the turbo tandem and other development projects

the value assigned to acquired in process technology was determined by identifying products under research in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established  including technology relating to products that have not received fda approval and which has no alternative future use 
during the remainder of and  there was no material change in the status of the project that provided the basis for the value assigned to acquired in process technology

interest income 
interest income decreased to million in from million in the decrease in interest income in is due primarily to lower interest rates on our invested balances and a lower investment portfolio balance 
loss before income taxes pre tax loss for the year ended december  was million  compared with a pre tax loss of million for the year ended december  the current period results included million of special items  in addition to million of losses related to our auction rate securities 
the prior year results included million of special items  as described above 
income tax expense for the year ended december   we recorded income tax expense of million comprised of state and foreign income taxes payable 
we did not recognize any deferred tax benefit during the year  as we recorded an additional valuation allowance to fully reserve the deferred tax benefits arising from our pretax loss for  based on our analysis of the realizability of our deferred tax asset 
this determination was based primarily on our forecast of available taxable income in future years 
based on our analysis  we expect that it is more likely than not that we will realize the deferred tax asset  net of valuation allowance  recorded on the balance sheet as of december  net loss we recorded a net loss for year ended december  of million  or per fully diluted share  compared with a net loss of million  or per fully diluted share  in functional currency the functional currency of spectranetics international bv and spectranetics deutschland gmbh is the euro

we also have tax loss carryforwards in the netherlands  which expire in  of approximately million available to offset future taxable income  if any  in the netherlands 
in germany  we pay income taxes of of our german statutory income 
an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of approximately million is available to offset future regular tax liabilities and has no expiration date 
for alternative minimum tax purposes  we have net operating loss carryforwards for united states federal income tax purposes of approximately million 
we also have research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes at december  of approximately million  which are available to reduce future federal income taxes  if any  and expire at varying dates through at december   we increased to our valuation allowance against our us deferred tax asset 
recent events  primarily the third quarter indictment of former employees  the related million accrual for indemnification costs for these employees  and the possibility that such costs could exceed the estimated accrual  caused us to conclude that we no longer meet the accounting criteria for recognizing a portion of our deferred tax asset 
see note  income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and current investment securities available for sale of million  up million from december  as of december   our current investment securities included million of auction rate securities ars which we liquidated in the first quarter of at to of par 
at december   our ars totaled million and were classified as long term investment securities  as we considered them illiquid 
see further discussion of our ars in note  investment securities  to our consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report 
in may  we completed the acquisition of the endovascular business of kensey nash corporation knc for million in cash 
we agreed to pay knc an additional million based on product development  regulatory and sales milestones 
of the million  up to million is payable based on various product development and regulatory milestones associated with the acquired products 
as of december   we have paid million of the product development and regulatory milestones 
most of the remaining product development and regulatory milestone payments will be payable over the next one to two years subject to completion of product development milestones by knc and fda approvals for the thromcat device 
the sales milestone payment of million is payable once cumulative sales of the acquired products reach million 
as of december   cumulative sales of the acquired products totaled million 
we expect to make the million payment in late in august  three former employees with whom we have indemnification obligations were indicted on charges related to the subjects of a federal investigation 
the indictments significantly increased the likelihood that the former employees future defense costs will be substantial and ongoing  and that our indemnification obligations to these employees will exceed the limits of our insurance coverage 
therefore  in the third quarter of  we accrued a million charge reflecting the low end of our estimate of the range of our contingent liability under the indemnification obligations 
we currently estimate that the legal fees in this matter for the federal district court stage of these proceedings could range from million to million through trial and that these costs are expected to be paid over the course of the court proceedings 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  anticipated funds from operations and other sources of liquidity  including potential borrowings under our revolving line of credit with wells fargo bank  national association  described below  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next twelve months 
however  there is no assurance that additional funding will not be needed or sought prior to such time 
in the event that we require additional working capital to fund future operations and any future acquisitions  we may enter into credit and financing arrangements with one or more independent institutional lenders  sell shares of our common stock or other equity securities  or sell debt securities 
there is no assurance that any financing transaction will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all  or that any financing transaction will not be dilutive to our current stockholders 

table of contents operating activities 
for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities totaled million 
the primary sources and uses of cash were the following excluding approximately million of non cash expenses and the million of accrued indemnification costs which did not impact cash in  our net loss of million yielded million of cash from our operating results  prior to changes in our working capital 
non cash expenses included million of depreciation and amortization  million of stock based compensation  million of provision for excess and obsolete inventories  million of asset impairment charge and million of an increase in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
the net decrease in operating assets and liabilities of approximately million was due primarily to the following an increase in equipment held for rental or loan of million as a result of placement activity of our laser systems through our rental and evaluation programs  a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities excluding the accrued indemnification costs of million  due primarily to the payment of year end accrued commissions and bonuses and the timing of vendor payments 
these uses of cash were partially offset by a decrease in trade accounts receivable of approximately million  due primarily to an decrease in days sales outstanding compared to the prior year  a decrease in inventory of approximately million  largely in disposables inventory  due primarily to a reduction in days on hand  a decrease in prepaid expenses of million  due primarily to a decrease in prepaid insurance 
the table below presents the change in receivables and inventory in relative terms  through the presentation of financial ratios 
days sales outstanding are calculated by dividing the ending accounts receivable balance  net of reserves for sales returns and doubtful accounts  by the average daily sales for the quarter 
inventory turns are calculated by dividing annualized cost of sales for the quarter by ending inventory

table of contents line of credit on february   we entered into a credit and security agreement credit agreement with wells fargo bank  national association wells fargo  acting through its wells fargo business credit wfbc operating division  for a three year million revolving line of credit 
pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement  we may borrow under the revolving line of credit subject to borrowing base limitations 
these limitations allow us to borrow  subject to specified reserves  up to of eligible domestic accounts receivable  defined as receivables aged less than days from the invoice date along with specific exclusions for contra accounts  concentrations  and other accounts otherwise deemed ineligible by wfbc 
borrowings under the revolving line bear interest at a variable rate equal to the lesser of the wells fargo prime rate plus or the daily three month libor plus 
the margins on the base interest rates are subject to reduction if we achieve certain annual net income levels 
accrued interest on any outstanding balance under the revolving line is payable monthly in arrears 
although we have no immediate plans to access the line of credit  we expect that when utilized  it will be for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the revolving line of credit is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets 
the credit agreement requires us to maintain a minimum of million cash and investments at wells fargo and requires a lockbox arrangement  which provides for all receipts to be swept daily to reduce borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
we are required to pay customary fees with respect to the facility  including a fee on the average unused portion of the revolving line 
if there are borrowings under the revolving line of credit  we will be subject to certain financial covenants including rolling month adjusted ebitda and minimum book net worth covenants 
the credit agreement contains customary events of default  including the failure to make required payments  the failure to comply wither certain covenants or other agreements  the occurrence of a material adverse change  failure to pay certain other indebtedness and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency 
upon the occurrence and continuation of an event of default  amounts due under the credit agreement may be accelerated 
the foregoing description of the credit agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the credit agreement  a copy of which is filed as exhibit to our current report on form k filed with the sec on march  as of the date of this report  we had no borrowings under the revolving line of credit 
capital resources during the years ended december  and  we purchased approximately million and million  respectively  of property and equipment for cash 
during and we also invested approximately million and million  respectively  in laser equipment held for rental or loan under our rental and evaluation programs these amounts are included in cash flows from operating activities 
we expect to fund any capital expenditures in from cash and cash equivalents 

table of contents contractual obligations the company leases office space  furniture  vehicles and equipment under noncancelable operating leases with initial terms that expire at various dates through purchase obligations consist of purchase orders issued primarily for inventory 
royalty obligations represent the minimum royalties due under license agreements 
the future minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases  purchase obligations and royalty obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands total one year or less years years more than years operating leases purchase obligations royalty obligations total off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or that are reasonably likely to have  a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
our most significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report 
below is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and their impact on the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those relating to the carrying amount of our investments in auction rate securities  the carrying amount of property and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets  valuation allowances and reserves for receivables  inventories and deferred income tax assets  stock based compensation  contingencies  indemnification costs and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these judgments and estimates form the basis for the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not objectively available from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and the carrying values of these assets and liabilities may differ under different assumptions or conditions 
accrued indemnification costs 
as discussed above under liquidity and capital resources  in august  three former employees with whom we have indemnification obligations were indicted on charges related to the subjects of a federal investigation 
we currently estimate that the legal fees in this matter for the federal district court stage of these proceedings could range from million to million through trial 
therefore  in the third quarter of  we accrued a million charge reflecting the low end of our estimate of the range of our contingent liability under indemnification obligations 
we developed the estimate with the assistance of outside legal counsel familiar with court proceedings similar in nature to the proceedings related to our indemnification obligations 
the actual expenses may be higher or lower than the estimate depending upon final resolution of the matter 
factors that would cause us to determine that the million accrual needed to be increased would include  
table of contents but not be limited to i whether the trial date is extended into  ii whether the defendants are granted separate trials  and iii the length of an appeals process  if any 
as of december   we had received invoices for such legal fees and costs of million  of which million was paid 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of our disposable products is recognized when products are shipped to the customer and title transfers 
in general  customers do not have a right of return for credit or refund 
however  we allow returns under certain circumstances and record a provision for sales returns based on historical returns experience 
revenue from the sale of excimer laser systems is recognized after completion of contractual obligations  which generally include delivery and installation of the systems 
our field service engineers are responsible for installation of each laser 
we generally provide a one year warranty on laser sales  which includes parts  labor and replacement gas 
upon expiration of the warranty period  we offer similar service to our customers under service contracts or on a fee for service basis 
we recognize revenue from fee for service arrangements upon completion of the related service 
we account for service provided during the one year warranty or service contract period as a separate unit of accounting in accordance with us gaap 
as such  we defer the fair value of this service and recognize it as revenue on a straight line basis over the related warranty or service contract period and warranty and service costs are expensed in the period they are incurred 
revenue allocated to the laser element is recognized upon completion of all contractual obligations in the sales contract  which generally include delivery and installation of the laser system 
in addition to the sale of laser systems  we also offer laser system placement programs  including flat rate rentals and variable depending on catheter purchases rentals for which we invoice the customer and recognize revenue on a monthly or quarterly basis 
we also offer a cap free program under which the customer does not pay a rental fee  but agrees to a catheter price list that includes a per unit surcharge 
we recognize the total surcharge as rental revenue upon shipment of the catheters  believing it to be the best measurement of revenue associated with the customers use of the laser system each month 
under the laser system placement programs  the laser system is transferred to the equipment held for rental or loan account upon shipment  and the depreciation expense related to the system is included in cost of revenue based upon a five year expected life of the laser system 
costs to maintain the equipment are expensed as incurred 
we sell to end users in the united states and internationally as well as to certain international distributors 
sales to international distributors represented approximately of our worldwide sales in and distributor agreements are in place with each distributor  which outline the significant terms of the transactions between the distributor and the company 
the terms and conditions of sales to our international distributors do not differ materially from the terms and conditions of sales to our domestic and international end user customers 
sales to distributors are recognized either at shipment or a later date in accordance with the agreed upon contract terms with distributors  provided that we have received an order  the price is fixed or determinable  collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  all contractual obligations have been met and we can reasonably estimate returns 
we provide products to our distributors at agreed wholesale prices and do not typically provide any special right of return or exchange  discounts  significant sales incentives  price protection or stock rotation rights to any of our distributors 
allowance for sales returns 
we estimate product sales returns based upon an analysis of revenue transactions and historical experience of sales returns and price adjustments 
the provision for sales returns is recorded as a reduction of revenue based on our estimates 
actual sales returns may vary depending on customer inventory levels  new product introductions and other factors 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable based on facts in existence at the time of estimation  these facts are subject to change 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
we use judgment in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon an aging of accounts receivable  historical experience and the overall quality of the receivables 
we review individual accounts receivable balances for collectibility 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is remote 
we believe our estimates regarding the collectibility of our accounts receivable are reasonable  however  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  significant additional allowances could be required 
inventory reserves 
we calculate an inventory reserve for estimated obsolescence or excess inventory based on historical usage and sales  as well as assumptions about future demand for our products 
we review and update our estimates for excess and obsolete inventory on a quarterly basis 
the estimates we use for product demand are consistent with our sales forecasts and are also used for near term production planning and inventory purchasing 
increases in the inventory reserves result in a corresponding expense which is generally recorded to cost of goods sold 
we believe that our estimates for obsolete and excess inventory are reasonable based on facts in existence at the time of estimation 
however  other factors  such as future product introductions  the introduction of competing technologies or changes in market demand  may require additional reserves  which could have a material effect on gross margins in any given period 
royalty liability 
we license certain patents from various licensors pursuant to license agreements 
royalty expense is calculated pursuant to the terms of the license agreements and is included in research  development and other technology in the accompanying financial statements 
we have established liabilities for royalty payment obligations based on these calculations  which may involve management estimates that require judgment 
although we believe the estimates to be reasonable based on facts in existence at the time of estimation  the estimates are subject to change based on changes in the underlying facts and assumptions used to develop these estimates 
stock based compensation 
we measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in our consolidated financial statements 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using either the black scholes options pricing model or a trinomial lattice model  both of which require management s estimates and assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables including volatility  expected term of the options  and other inputs 
in recognizing stock based compensation expense  we also estimate future forfeitures based on historical forfeiture data 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current and prior periods and could materially affect our results of operations 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
stock based compensation expense recognized for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided to the extent it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
as of december   we have a net deferred tax asset of million  which represents the amount related to net operating losses in the netherlands that we expect to utilize against taxable income in the netherlands prior to their expiration at the end of based primarily on our projections of future taxable income  we believe that it is more likely than not that this net deferred tax asset will be realized  but there can be no assurances that our estimates are accurate or that our assumptions will not change 

table of contents valuation of purchased in process research and development iprd 
when we acquired the kensey nash endovascular product line in the second quarter of  the purchase price was allocated based upon the fair value of tangible assets  iprd  goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with us gaap applicable at that time 
we recognized million of iprd for the portion of the purchase price allocated to the appraised value of in process technologies  defined as those technologies relating to products that had not received fda approval and had no alternative future use 
such valuations require the use of significant estimates 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to iprd was determined by estimating future cash flows of the technology and discounting net cash flows back to present values 
we considered  among other things  the project s stage of completion  complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date  costs already incurred  projected costs to complete  contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets  expected introduction date and the estimated useful life of the technology 
the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition was based on the time value of money and medical technology investment risk 
subsequent to the purchase price allocation  through december   there has been no material change in the status of the project that provided the basis for the value assigned to acquired in process technology 
we have commercialized the next generation thromcat in europe and are in the process of determining the fda regulatory pathway for the next generation thromcat in the us goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
we amortize intangible assets with estimable useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and we review them for impairment annually  or whenever events or circumstances indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we amortize our intangible assets  which consist primarily of patents  using the straight line method over periods which currently range from to years 
management must use significant estimates and assumptions in evaluating whether or not impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets has occurred  and in evaluating the useful lives of amortized intangible assets 
significant changes in these estimates and management s assumptions may reduce the carrying amount of these intangible assets 
valuation of auction rate securities ars 
the fair value for our ars at december  is based on a third party pricing model and is classified as a level pricing category in accordance with the accounting rules for fair value measurements 
we utilized a discounted cash flow model to estimate the current fair market value for each of the securities we owned as there was little recent activity in the secondary markets in these types of securities 
this model used unique inputs for each security including discount rate  interest rate currently being paid and estimated date to liquidation 
the discount rates ranged from to 
in order to calculate the discount rate  we estimated the expected yield on an average high grade municipal bond 
in our view  high grade municipal bonds are the most closely comparable security to the auction rate securities contained in our portfolio because they have similar credit quality and are government backed  as is the substantial portion of our ars portfolio through the ffelp program 
we utilized forecasts for the month libor based on the forecasted data from wolters kluwer blue chip financial forecasts  then estimated the spread between the month libor and a high grade municipal bond to be basis points  based on current and historical market data 
because we are currently unable to withdraw from the securities  we also added a basis points illiquidity premium to the discount rate 
the estimated liquidation dates used in the valuation analysis were years from december  at december   we also performed a sensitivity analysis in the valuation of our ars using an estimated date to liquidation of plus or minus one year and a discount rate of plus or minus basis points 
the sensitivity analysis with these parameters calculated a valuation ranging from to of par 
we believe that our current valuation of of par is a reasonable measure of fair value of the securities 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable based on facts in existence at the time of estimation  these facts and our estimates are subject to change 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements in october  an update was made to asc  revenue recognition multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this update establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
it also replaces references to fair value with selling price to distinguish from the fair value measurements required under the fair value measurements and disclosures guidance  eliminates the use of the residual method for allocation  and expands the ongoing disclosure requirements 
this update is effective for us beginning january   and can be applied prospectively or retrospectively 
the adoption of this accounting guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued guidance that requires reporting entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements including significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements and information on purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
the guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for level reconciliation disclosures that are effective for annual periods beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our investments and our cash equivalents  which consist primarily of money market funds  and foreign currency fluctuations 
investment securities are classified as available for sale  and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with temporary unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component in stockholders equity  net of applicable taxes 
at any time  sharp changes in interest rates can affect the value of our investment portfolio and its interest earnings 
currently  we do not hedge these interest rate exposures 
we held million in auction rate securities ars  classified as current assets on our balance sheet as of december  in the first quarter of  we sold our remaining ars positions at to of par 
our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is primarily related to sales of our products in europe  which are denominated primarily in the euro 
changes in the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar could adversely affect our revenue and net income 
exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk may increase over time as our business evolves and our products continue to be introduced into international markets 
currently  we do not hedge against any foreign currencies and  as a result  could incur gains or losses 
for the year ended december   approximately million of decreased revenue and million of decreased operating expenses were the result of exchange rate fluctuations of the us dollar in relation to the euro and other european currencies as compared to the prior year 
accordingly  the net impact of exchange rate fluctuations on consolidated net income for the year ended december  was a decrease in net income of million as compared to the prior year
