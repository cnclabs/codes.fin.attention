table of contents other matters contingencies in the normal course of business the company and its subsidiaries are parties to various commercial and legal claims  actions and complaints  including matters involving warranty claims  intellectual property claims  general liability and various other risks 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
it is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the company and its subsidiaries will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or  if not  what the impact might be 
the company s environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed separately below 
the company s management does not expect that the results in any of these commercial and legal claims  actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
litigation in january  dtp  a subsidiary of the company  filed a declaratory judgment action in united states district court  southern district of indiana indianapolis division against the united automobile  aerospace  and agricultural implements workers of america uaw local no 
and gerald poor  individually and as the representative of a defendant class 
dtp sought the court s affirmation that dtp did not violate the labor management relations act or the employee retirement income security act erisa by unilaterally amending certain medical plans effective april  and october   prior to the expiration of the then current collective bargaining agreements 
on september   the court found that dtp s reservation of the right to make such amendments reducing the level of benefits provided to retirees was limited by its collectively bargained health insurance agreement with the uaw  which did not expire until april  thus  the amendments were untimely 
in the company recorded a charge of million as a result of the court s decision 
dtp filed a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court  southern district of indiana indianapolis division against the uaw local no 
and jim barrett and others  individually and as representatives of a defendant class  on february  again seeking the court s affirmation that dtp will not violate the labor management relations act or erisa by modifying the level of benefits provided retirees to make them comparable to other company retiree benefit plans after april  certain retirees  on behalf of themselves and others  filed a mirror image action in the united states district court  eastern district of michigan southern division on march   for which a class has been certified 
during the last quarter of the action pending in indiana was dismissed  while the action in michigan is continuing and in the discovery phase 
the company is vigorously defending against the suit 
this contingency is subject to many uncertainties  therefore based on the information available to date  the company cannot estimate the amount or the range of potential loss  if any 
environmental the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors  subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties prps at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act superfund and equivalent state laws and  as such  may presently be liable for the cost of clean up and other remedial activities at such sites 
responsibility for clean up and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula 
the company believes that none of these matters  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
generally  this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not material or the liability will be shared with other prps  although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter 
based on information available to the company which in most cases includes an estimate of allocation of liability among prps  the probability that other prps  many of whom are large  solvent public companies  
table of contents will fully pay the cost apportioned to them  currently available information from prps and or federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs  remediation alternatives  and estimated legal fees  the company has an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities with a balance at december  of million 
the company has accrued amounts that do not exceed million related to any individual site except for the crystal springs site discussed below  and we do not believe that the costs related to any of these sites will have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
the company expects to pay out substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental liability over the next three to five years 
in connection with the sale of kuhlman electric corporation  the company agreed to indemnify the buyer and kuhlman electric for certain environmental liabilities  then unknown to the company  relating to certain operations of kuhlman electric that pre date the company s acquisition of kuhlman electric 
during  kuhlman electric notified the company that it discovered potential environmental contamination at its crystal springs  mississippi plant while undertaking an expansion of the plant 
the company is continuing to work with the mississippi department of environmental quality and kuhlman electric to investigate and remediate to the extent necessary  historical contamination at the plant and surrounding area 
kuhlman electric and others  including the company  were sued in numerous related lawsuits  in which multiple claimants alleged personal injury and property damage relating to the alleged environmental contamination 
in  the company and other defendants entered into settlements that resolved approximately of those claims and the remainder of them have since been dismissed 
in and  four additional lawsuits were filed against kuhlman electric and others  including the company  on behalf of approximately plaintiffs  alleging personal injury relating to the alleged environmental contamination 
one of the lawsuits  involving a single plaintiff  was dismissed by the trial court in april and the plaintiff s appeal of that decision was dismissed by the appellate court in august the company entered into a settlement in july regarding the personal injury claims of the plaintiffs in the other three lawsuits and those of approximately  unfiled claimants represented by those plaintiffs attorneys 
in exchange for  among other things  the dismissal with prejudice of these lawsuits and the release of claims by the unfiled claimants  the company agreed to pay up to million in settlement funds  which was expensed in the second quarter of in november the company paid million related to this settlement 
the remaining payment of approximately million is expected to be paid in february conditional asset retirement obligations in march  asc topic  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  which requires the company to recognize legal obligations to perform asset retirements in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
certain government regulations require the removal and disposal of asbestos from an existing facility at the time the facility undergoes major renovations or is demolished 
the liability exists because the facility will not last forever  but it is conditional on future renovations even if there are no immediate plans to remove the materials  which pose no health or safety hazard in their current condition 
similarly  government regulations require the removal or closure of underground storage tanks and above ground storage tanks when their use ceases  the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyl transformers and capacitors when their use ceases  and the disposal of used furnace bricks and liners  and lead based paint in conjunction with facility renovations or demolition 
the company currently has manufacturing locations that have been identified as containing these items 
the fair value to remove and dispose of this material has been estimated and recorded at million as of december  and million at december  product liability like many other industrial companies who have historically operated in the us  the company or parties the company is obligated to indemnify continues to be named as one of many defendants in asbestos related personal injury actions 
we believe that the company s involvement is limited because  in general  these claims relate to a few types of automotive friction products that were manufactured many years ago and contained encapsulated asbestos 
the nature of the fibers  the encapsulation and the manner of use lead the 
table of contents company to believe that these products are highly unlikely to cause harm 
as of december  and december  the company had approximately  and  pending asbestos related product liability claims  respectively 
of the  outstanding claims at december   approximately  were pending in just three jurisdictions  where significant tort and judicial reform activities are underway 
the company s policy is to vigorously defend against these lawsuits and the company has been successful in obtaining dismissal of many claims without any payment 
the company expects that the vast majority of the pending asbestos related product liability claims where it is a defendant or has an obligation to indemnify a defendant will result in no payment being made by the company or its insurers 
in  of the approximately  claims resolved  resulted in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the company 
in the full year of  of the approximately  claims resolved  only resulted in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the company 
prior to june  the settlement and defense costs associated with all claims were covered by the company s primary layer insurance coverage  and these carriers administered  defended  settled and paid all claims under a funding arrangement 
in addition to the primary insurance available for asbestos related claims  the company has substantial additional layers of insurance available for potential future asbestos related product claims 
as such  the company continues to believe that its coverage is sufficient to meet foreseeable liabilities 
in june  primary layer insurance carriers notified the company of the alleged exhaustion of their policy limits 
this led the company to access the next available layer of insurance coverage 
since june  secondary layer insurers have been responsible for asbestos related litigation defense and settlement expenses pursuant to a funding arrangement 
a declaratory judgment action was filed in january in the circuit court of cook county  illinois by continental casualty company and related companies cna against the company and certain of its other historical general liability insurers 
cna provided the company with both primary and additional layer insurance  and  in conjunction with other insurers  is currently defending and indemnifying the company in its pending asbestos related product liability claims 
the lawsuit seeks to determine the extent of insurance coverage available to the company including whether the available limits exhaust on a per occurrence or an aggregate basis  and to determine how the applicable coverage responsibilities should be apportioned 
on august   the court issued an interim order regarding the apportionment matter 
the interim order has the effect of making insurers responsible for all defense and settlement costs pro rata to time on the risk  with the pro ration method to hold the insured harmless for periods of bankrupt or unavailable coverage 
appeals of the interim order were denied 
however  the issue is reserved for appellate review at the end of the action 
although it is impossible to predict the outcome of pending or future claims or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the state or federal levels  due to the encapsulated nature of the products  the company s experiences in vigorously defending and resolving claims in the past  and the company s significant insurance coverage with solvent carriers as of the date of this filing  management does not believe that asbestos related product liability claims are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial condition

critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
these policies require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes 
management makes estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain  relating to the reporting of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our most critical accounting policies are discussed below 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
depreciation the automotive industry experienced unprecedented declines in production in the fourth quarter of and projected continued declines for the full year of according to accounting standards codification asc  future depreciation expense should be revised due to a change in the estimated future benefits inherent in an asset  the pattern of consumption of those benefits  or the information available to the entity about those benefits 
as a result of the and unprecedented declines in production activity  the

although the company may enter into long term supply agreements with its major customers  each shipment of goods is treated as a separate sale and the prices are not fixed over the life of the agreements 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with asc topic  the company periodically reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets  whether held for use or disposal  including other intangible assets  when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
such events and circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in market volumes  or project life  or a loss of a major customer application ie  a triggering event 
the company s impairment review is performed at each manufacturing  assembly  and technical site using data that is the basis for the company s annual budget or forecast on an interim basis and long range plan lrp 
the annual budget and lrp include a five year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments 
if a triggering event has occurred  the assets are identified by the operating location and management as potentially impaired and a recoverability review is performed by management 
the review will determine if a current or future alternative use exists for additional customer applications or if redeployment of the assets to any of the company s other operating sites around the world is justified 
the recoverability test compares projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of a product line or a specific customer application or asset grouping  as applicable 
if the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment  management will perform a fair value analysis 
management determines fair value under asc topic using the appropriate valuation technique of market  income or cost approach 
management believes that the estimates and assumptions are reasonable however  changes in assumptions with respect to future volumes  program project life or future asset use  in addition to future cash flows underlying these estimates could affect the company s fair value evaluations 
due to the sudden decline in the global automotive markets in and  the company reviewed the carrying value of its long lived assets 
as a result of these reviews  the company recognized million and million in impairment of long lived assets ie  plant and equipment as part of restructuring

goodwill the company annually reviews its goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year for all of its reporting units  or more often when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
the company s goodwill impairment review  under asc topic  requires the company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows  discount rates and growth rates 
the basis of our goodwill impairment analysis is the company s annual budget and long range plan lrp 
the annual budget and lrp include a five year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments 
as part of the projection  we assumed the last year of the lrp data is a fair indication of the future performance  including fundamental industry growth for the business beyond the five year period into perpetuity 
as the lrp is estimated over a significant future period of time  those estimates and assumptions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty 
we also utilize market valuation models and other financial ratios  which require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to our assets and businesses 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are reasonable 
different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value 
the primary assumptions affecting the company s december  goodwill impairment review are as follows discount rate the company used a weighted average cost of capital wacc as the discount rate for future cash flows 
the wacc is intended to represent a rate of return that would be expected by a market participant 
operating income margin the company utilized historical and expected operating income margins  which varied based on the projections of each reporting unit being evaluated 
in addition to the above significant assumptions  the company notes the following risk to volume assumptions that could have an impact on the discounted cash flow model our industry is cyclical and our results of operations will be adversely affected by industry downturns 
we are dependent on market segments that use our key products and would be affected by decreasing demand in those segments 
we are subject to risks related to our international operations 
while the company believes that these assumptions are appropriate  significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the company s analysis related to one of its reporting units in the engine operating segment  whose estimated fair value is of its carrying value 
based on our sensitivity analysis  a increase in the discount rate or a decrease in the operating margin assumptions would result in the carrying value exceeding the estimated fair value of one reporting unit tested within the engine operating segment 
this would require further evaluation of the reporting unit s 
table of contents goodwill  under a step two impairment test 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to the estimated fair value of that reporting unit 
millions of dollars impact percentage point increase in discount rate percentage point decrease in operating margin in the company recorded impairment charges totaling million to adjust beru s goodwill to its estimated fair value 
the impairment charge is attributable to a decrease in the operating unit s estimated fair value based primarily upon the effect of the decline in european market conditions on current and projected operating results 
the impairment charge was also impacted by the recognition of additional goodwill in the second quarter of  which was based on the court determined buy out value of per share related to the domination and profit transfer agreement 
any differences in future results compared to management s estimates could result in fair values different from estimated fair values  which could materially impact the company s future results of operations and financial condition 
see note  recent transactions  for further discussion on the beru domination and profit transfer agreement 
the impairment tests completed in the fourth quarter of and indicated no impairment for either year  and estimated fair value to be approximately and for the company s carrying value in and  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding goodwill 
environmental accrual we work with outside experts to determine a range of potential liability for environmental sites 
the ranges for each individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the total accrued liability 
management s estimate of the loss range for environmental liability  including conditional asset retirement obligations  for is between approximately million and million 
we record an accrual at the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be determined  in which case we record the accrual at the low end of the range 
at the end of  our total accrued environmental liability was million  which includes our conditional asset retirement obligation under asc topic of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding environmental accrual 
product warranty the company provides warranties on some of its products 
the warranty terms are typically from one to three years 
provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold 
these estimates are established using historical information about the nature  frequency  and average cost of warranty claim settlements  as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties 
management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims 
management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate  however  actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to the accrual 
our warranty provision over the last three years  and as a percentage of net sales  has trended as follows millions of dollars net sales warranty provision warranty provision as a percentage of net sales 
table of contents the following table illustrates the sensitivity of a basis point change as a percentage of sales in the assumed warranty trend on the company s accrued warranty liability income expense millions of dollars basis point decrease basis point increase at the end of  our total accrued warranty liability was million 
the accrual is represented as million in current liabilities and million in non current liabilities on our balance sheet 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding product warranty 
other loss accruals and valuation allowances the company has numerous other loss exposures  such as customer claims  workers compensation claims  litigation  and recoverability of assets 
establishing loss accruals or valuation allowances for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and ultimate realization 
we estimate losses under the programs using consistent and appropriate methods  however  changes to our assumptions could materially affect our recorded accrued liabilities for loss or asset valuation allowances 
pension and other post employment defined benefits the company provides post employment defined benefits to a number of its current and former employees
