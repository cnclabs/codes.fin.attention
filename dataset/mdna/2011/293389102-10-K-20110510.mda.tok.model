overview the company we are one of the largest providers of business forms to independent distributors in the united states and are also one of the largest providers of blank t shirts in north america to the activewear market 
we operate in two reportable segments print and apparel 
our print business challenges in our print segment  we are engaged in an industry undergoing significant changes 
technology advances have made electronic distribution of documents  internet hosting  digital printing and print on demand valid  cost effective alternatives to traditional custom printed documents and customer communications 
in addition  the downturn in the economy and turmoil in the credit markets in and have created highly competitive conditions in an already over supplied  price competitive industry 
thus  we believe we are facing the following challenges in the print segment of our business transformation of our portfolio of products excess production capacity and price competition within our industry economic uncertainties the following is a discussion of these business challenges and our strategy for managing their effect on our print business 

table of contents transformation of our portfolio of products traditional business documents are essential in order to conduct business 
however  many are being replaced or devalued with advances in digital technologies  causing steady declines in demand for a large portion of our current product line 
the same digital advances also introduce potential new opportunities for growth for us  such as print on demand services and product offerings that assist customers in their transition to digital business environments 
we currently have many innovative products  such as our recently introduced healthcare wristbands  secure document solutions  and innovative in mold label offerings  which address important business needs  and we feel are positioned for growth 
in addition  we will continue to look for new market opportunities and niches  such as our addition of our envelope offerings  that provide us with an opportunity for growth and differentiate us from our competition 
transforming our product offerings to continue to provide innovative  valuable solutions to our customers on a proactive basis will require us to make investments in new and existing technology and to develop key strategic business relationships 
excess production capacity and price competition within our industry paper mills continue to adjust production capacity through downtime and closures to attempt to keep supply in line with demand 
due to the limited number of paper mills  paper prices have been and are expected to remain fairly volatile 
in  we saw our material prices stabilize due to the depressed economic conditions 
however  during fiscal year  with the improving economy  paper mills  as expected  returned to their past practices of increasing paper prices 
despite a continued competitive marketplace  we have generally been able to pass through increased paper costs  although it can often take several quarters to push these through due to the custom nature of our products and or contractual relationships with some of our customers 
we expect this trend to continue  however  any downturn in the economy may limit our ability to recover all these costs 
as such  we will continue to focus our efforts on effectively managing and controlling our product costs to minimize the effects of the foregoing on our operational results  primarily through the use of forecasting models  and production and costing models 
however  an inherent risk in this process is that our assumptions are inaccurate  which could have a negative impact on our reported profit margins 
economic uncertainties as a result of the recessionary conditions of and  the economic climate has been volatile and challenging 
decreased demand and intense price competition resulted in significant declines in our revenue during those fiscal years as well during most of fiscal year although we have seen slight improvements in some economic indicators within our markets  a continued weak job market will continue to present a challenging environment for revenue growth 
as we cannot predict the pace of the economic recovery or its continuance  we will continue to be focused on customer retention  expanding our growth targeted products and continuing to develop new market niches 
in addition  we have proven a history of managing our costs and wouldn t expect this to change in the future 
our apparel business challenges in our apparel segment  our market niche is highly competitive  commodity driven and is generally dominated by a limited number of players 
the downturn in the economy and turmoil in the credit markets in and created an over supply situation which further increased competitive pressures in this market 
cotton  which represents of our costs  is a commodity product and subject to volatile fluctuations in price  due to general market conditions  domestic and international demand  perceived availability  international actions  etc 
as such  our operational costs are subject to significant swings  which may or may not be passed on to the marketplace due to competitive or economic conditions  competitors pricing strategies  etc 
thus  we believe we are facing the following challenges in our apparel segment business in fiscal cotton prices start up of and transition to our new manufacturing facility economic uncertainties cotton prices due to shortage of supply and other international factors  domestic cotton prices are at high levels not seen in years 
while there has been some abatement in prices of late  spot and future prices are still at levels significantly higher than historical averages 
whether or not prices will stay at current levels for a sustained period of time  or continue to recede is unknown 
due to current cotton pricing  we believe most large manufacturers are relatively short with respect to their cotton purchases  which increases their risk to potential volatility in swings in cotton prices 
we believe we are competitive with other companies in the united states apparel industry in negotiating the price of cotton and as such we do not feel we are at a competitive disadvantage from a cotton cost perspective 
while the market has over the past year absorbed a certain level of price increase due to previous increases in cotton costs  it is unknown at this time whether the market will allow the manufacturers to pass further price increases through to offset the current level of cotton pricing and whether our competitors will in fact attempt to pass through these costs 

table of contents completion of new manufacturing facility we are nearing the completion of phase on our new state of the art manufacturing facility located in agua prieta  mexico the project 
upon completion  expenditures associated with this facility are still expected to be in the range of million to million million for the building and million million for machinery and equipment  with approximately of the money having been expended to date 
at the completion of phase of the project expected to be by the end of may  we expect this facility will be able to produce approximately million pounds of fabric per week  with the eventual capacity to be between million to million pounds per week 
this compares to our previous capacity of approximately million to million pounds per week in our anaheim facility 
during the ramp up of this facility and the phase out of our current manufacturing facility in anaheim  ca  there will be considerable duplicate costs  inefficiencies  moving costs  etc 
that will have a negative impact on the apparel segment s fiscal year operating results 
our plan is to try to contain the remaining portion of these costs to the first six months of fiscal year  through an accelerated ramp up schedule 
our current estimate of the negative impact of the start up and ramp up costs of this facility remains at approximately million to million in fiscal the negative impact associated with this facility was approximately million for the fiscal year ended february  the success of this plan continues to be dependent on meeting key targets and any delay in the start up wind down schedule could add significantly to these costs 
once fully operational and the transition complete  and with sell through levels of million pounds to million pounds per week  we continue to anticipate significant manufacturing efficiencies will be realized 
the original estimate of the annualized cost savings associated with this facility was between million to million per annum 
however  a certain portion of the savings associated with the conversion of our dye machines have already been realized in our current manufacturing facility  hence part of the reason for the improvement in our operating margins in fiscal year nonetheless  we continue to anticipate a substantial savings in costs associated with this facility once fully operational and the transition has been completed and the production levels have been obtained 
economic uncertainties as a result of the recessionary conditions of and  the economic climate has been volatile and challenging 
decreased demand and intense price competition resulted in significant declines in our revenue during fiscal year and although we have seen an increase in our apparel revenues during fiscal year  and would expect such to continue  continued high unemployment and housing sector weakness and international instability all could potentially undermine the fragile state of the current economic recovery which could have a negative impact on our revenues 
as we cannot predict the pace of the economic recovery  or the continuance of the recent positive trends in unemployment numbers  we will be highly focused on customer retention  expanding our growth targeted markets and managing our costs both the start up and operational costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the disclosures and reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis  including those related to allowance for doubtful receivables  inventory valuations  property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  pension plan obligations  accrued liabilities and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical due to their affect on our more significant estimates and judgments used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we maintain a defined benefit pension plan for employees 
included in our financial results are pension costs that are measured using actuarial valuations 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ from actual results 
as our pension assets are invested in marketable securities  fluctuations in market values could potentially impact our funding status and associated liability recorded 
amounts allocated to amortizable intangibles are determined based on valuation analysis for our acquisitions and are amortized over their expected useful lives 
we evaluate these amounts periodically at least once a year to determine whether a triggering event has occurred during the year that would indicate potential impairment 
we exercise judgment in evaluating our long lived assets for impairment 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets that include other intangible assets  goodwill  and property  plant  and equipment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in performing tests of impairment  we must make assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets in assessing the recoverability of our long lived assets 
if these estimates or the 
table of contents related assumptions change  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in the future 
actual results could differ from assumptions made by management 
at february   our goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately million and million  respectively 
no impairment charge was required for the year ended february  based on the results of our annual impairment test 
the carrying value of invested capital for each reporting unit as compared to their fair value at february  was as follows carrying value of fair value of reporting unit invested capital invested capital apparel million million print million million we believe our businesses will generate sufficient undiscounted cash flow to more than recover the investments we have made in property  plant and equipment  as well as the goodwill and other intangibles recorded as a result of our acquisitions 
however  we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairments or specific triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values 
revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of products 
net sales consist of gross sales invoiced to customers  less certain related charges  including discounts  returns and other allowances 
returns  discounts and other allowances have historically been insignificant 
in some cases and upon customer request  we print and store custom print product for customer specified future delivery  generally within twelve months 
in this case  risk of loss from obsolescence passes to the customer  the customer is invoiced under normal credit terms and revenue is recognized when manufacturing is complete 
approximately million  million  and million of revenue were recognized under these agreements during fiscal years ended february   february   and february   respectively 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables to reflect estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based upon historical collection trends  current economic factors  and the assessment of the collectability of specific accounts 
we evaluate the collectability of specific accounts using a combination of factors  including the age of the outstanding balances  evaluation of customers current and past financial condition and credit scores  recent payment history  current economic environment  discussions with our project managers  and discussions with the customers directly 
our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly review inventory values on hand  using specific aging categories  and write down inventory deemed obsolete and or slow moving based on historical usage and estimated future usage to its estimated market value 
as actual future demand or market conditions may vary from those projected by management  adjustments to inventory valuations may be required 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of earnings 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  our provision for income taxes could be materially impacted 
in addition to the above  we also have to make assessments as to the adequacy of our accrued liabilities  more specifically our liabilities recorded in connection with our workers compensation and health insurance  as these plans are self funded 
to help us in this evaluation process  we routinely get outside third party assessments of our potential liabilities under each plan 
in view of such uncertainties  investors should not place undue reliance on our forward looking statements since such statements speak only as of the date when made 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended authoritative guidance for improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
the updated guidance requires new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements  including significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements and information on purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
the guidance also clarified existing fair value measurement disclosure guidance about the level of disaggregation  inputs  and valuation techniques 
the adoption of the new guidance on march  had no impact on the company s consolidated financial statements and disclosures 
results of operations the discussion that follows provides information which we believe is relevant to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
this analysis is presented in the following sections consolidated summary this section provides an overview of our consolidated results of operations for fiscal years  and segment operating results this section provides an analysis of our net sales  gross profit margin and operating income by segment 
consolidated summary consolidated fiscal years ended statements of earnings data net sales cost of goods sold gross profit margin selling  general and administrative impairment of goodwill and trademarks gain from disposal of assets income loss from operations other expense  net earnings loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net earnings loss net sales 
net sales began to rebound in fiscal year after being impacted by the significant economic downturn which began during the later part of our third quarter of fiscal year the volatile economic conditions of and and the resulting lower demand led an already competitive market environment to a weaker selling price environment  as manufacturers tried to maintain their production levels market share 
we saw this trend reverse somewhat during the latest fiscal year as the economy started to strengthen  which allowed manufacturers  for the most part  to pass along raw material costs increases and to realize some unit volume sales gains 
net sales for fiscal year were million  compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of million  or 
net sales declined by million  or during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year cost of goods sold 
our manufacturing costs increased by million from million for fiscal year to million for fiscal year  or while our sales increased over that same period 
as a result our gross profit margin net sales less cost of goods sold improved basis points over the comparable period last year from for fiscal year to for fiscal year  through increased operational efficiencies due to increased unit sales  increased unit selling price  and product mix changes 
due to our cost side focused approach during fiscal year and some favorable cotton pricing during the fourth quarter ended february   we were able to reduce our cost of goods sold by during fiscal year this resulted in our consolidated gross profit margin net sales less cost of goods sold increasing by basis points  from in fiscal to in fiscal 
table of contents selling  general  and administrative expenses 
for fiscal year  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or from million  or of sales for fiscal year to million  or of sales for fiscal year the increase in our selling  general and administrative expenses was basically volume related  however  we did incur increases in our credit card fees due to increased customer usage as well as performance incentive costs during the year 
in addition  we had approximately million in one time credits during fiscal year which did not repeat in fiscal year for fiscal year  our selling  general and administrative expenses decreased approximately million  or from million  or of sales for fiscal year to million  or of sales for fiscal year as a percentage of sales these expenses remained the same for both years  while on a dollar basis  these expenses decreased primarily as a result of our continual cost control initiatives and the focus of being cost side driven during these difficult economic times 
gain from disposal of assets 
the gain from disposal of assets of  for both fiscal years ended february  and resulted from sale of equipment 
income from operations 
our income from operations for fiscal year increased million from operational earnings of million  or of sales for fiscal year  to operational earnings of million  or of sales for fiscal year the increase in our operational earnings during fiscal year  related primarily to our improved consolidated gross profit margin  offset by slightly higher selling  general and administrative costs 
our income from operations for fiscal year increased from an operational loss of million  or of sales for fiscal year  to operational earnings of million  or of sales for fiscal year the increase in our operational earnings during fiscal year  related primarily to our improved consolidated gross profit margin  reduced selling  general and administrative costs  and the lack of a comparable non cash impairment charge in like we incurred in fiscal year other income and expense 
our interest expense was million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
our interest expense decreased in fiscal year due mainly to increased capitalized interest related to our agua prieta facility and in fiscal year due to less debt on average being outstanding 
during fiscal year  we capitalized interest expense relating to our agua prieta  mexico construction project of million compared to million for fiscal year no interest was capitalized during fiscal year provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rates for fiscal years  and were  and  respectively 
our rate for fiscal year reduced over our rate for fiscal year due to an increase in our domestic production activities deduction credit 
our effective tax rate for was impacted by the non deductible goodwill impairment charge 
net earnings 
our net earnings increased from million  or of sales for fiscal year to earnings of million  or of sales for fiscal year basic earnings per share increased from earnings of per share for fiscal year to earnings of per share for fiscal year diluted earnings per share increased from earnings of per share for fiscal year to earnings of per share for fiscal year the increase in net earnings during the period related primarily to our improved operational margin 
our net earnings increased from a loss of million  or of sales for fiscal year to earnings of million  or of sales for fiscal year basic earnings per share increased from a loss of per share for fiscal year to earnings of per share for fiscal year diluted earnings per share increased from a loss of per share for fiscal year to earnings of per share for fiscal year the increase in net earnings during the period related primarily to the lack of a non cash impairment charge as was incurred in fiscal year 
table of contents segment operatingresults fiscal years ended net sales by segment in thousands print apparel total print segment 
the print segment net sales represented   and of our consolidated net sales for fiscal years   and  respectively 
our print sales declined by million  or during the fiscal year and million  or during fiscal year  when compared to the preceding fiscal year 
the decline in our print sales particularly in  was primarily due to the severe economic recession which started during the later part of our third quarter of the fiscal year in addition to the general impact of the economic recession on our sales  the adoption of digital technologies continues to erode revenues from our traditional print business 
the evolution to digital technology has been transpiring for some time now  and we would expect this to continue into the future 
the turbulent economy also led to weaker pricing in an already competitive industry as our customers sought cost savings to improve their own profitability in the light of declining sales 
apparel segment 
the apparel segment net sales represented   and of our consolidated net sales for fiscal years  and  respectively 
our fiscal year net sales for the apparel segment increased by million  or over fiscal year  while our net sales decreased by million  or over fiscal due to improving economic factors  we were able to increase our unit sales to new and existing customers by approximately and increase our average unit selling price by approximately during fiscal year 
the decrease in our fiscal year sales  due to economic factors  was generally contained to the first three quarters where we saw our apparel sales decline by million  or 
as the economy started to improve and retailers started to experience some comparable sales growth  we were able to partially offset this sales decline with a fourth quarter sales gain of million  or 
fiscal years ended gross profit by segment in thousands print apparel total print segment 
our print gross profit margin margin  as a percent of sales  was  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
in fiscal we saw our material prices rise  however  we have been able to offset these price increases through selling price increases and operational improvements 
in fiscal we saw our material prices stabilize due to depressed economic conditions 
as such  we were able to fully realize the benefits associated with our costs control initiatives started during fiscal apparel segment 
our apparel margin  as a percent of sales  was  and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
we were able to increase our margin by basis points during fiscal year through an increase in our unit sales price and improved operational efficiencies which have been able to offset our higher raw material costs 
during the previous fiscal year  spot cotton prices increased significantly  however  manufacturers were able to insulate themselves from some of these increases with forward purchase contracts 
however  because spot cotton prices have remained at these levels for a sustained period of time  most of these favorable forward contracts have expired and higher cotton costs are starting to impact all manufacturer s inventory costs 
as such  while we have to date been able to offset the higher costs of cotton  we continue to be concerned with current cotton pricing  and the potential impact upon our operation results for fiscal year our ability to manage this potential cost increase will be dependent upon many factors  a number of which are outside of our control  such as the continued economic recovery of the united states  outside market factors such as availability of cotton and the actions of our competitors 

table of contents cost control was a major factor in the improvement of our margin for gas prices were more favorable in as compared to and  combined with lower chemical and other input costs  helped to partially offset the reduction in sales for the year 
in addition all non essential overtime was eliminated and a period of day manufacturing was implemented in our main fabric producing plant in anaheim for a portion of the year without impacting our reported margin 
we were also able to take advantage  during the fourth quarter  of lower cotton prices which we had locked in at previously contracted prices earlier in the year when cotton was selling at a much lower price per pound 
fiscal years ended profit by segment in thousands print apparel total less corporate expenses earnings loss before income taxes print segment 
as a percent of sales  our print segment s profits were   and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
our print segment s profit for fiscal year remained level at million  the same as for fiscal year while our print segment s profit on a percentage basis increased for fiscal year over fiscal year  on a dollar basis it decreased by approximately million  or 
the decrease in our print profit during fiscal year related to the decline in our sales during the period  as previously discussed 
apparel segment 
as a percent of sales  our apparel segment s profits were   and 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million and million to goodwill and trademarks  respectively 
the increase in our apparel profits during both fiscal year and related primarily to our improved gross profit margins for these years due to the factors previously discussed 
in addition to the significant improvement in our gross profits margins as noted earlier  during fiscal year cost cutting in selling  general  and administrative expenses were achieved following a review of our advertising and marketing activities 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal years ended dollars in thousands change working capital cash working capital 
our working capital increased by approximately million  or from million at february  to million at february  the increase in our working capital during the period related primarily to the increase in our inventories on hand  which increased in anticipation of our transition of our manufacturing from anaheim  ca to agua prieta  mexico 
our current ratio  calculated by dividing our current assets by our current liabilities  increased from to at february  to to at february   due to the increased inventory on hand 
fiscal years ended dollars in thousands change net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities cash flows from operating activities 
cash flows from operations during fiscal decreased by million  or over fiscal year  which had increased by million  or over fiscal year the change in our cash flows from operating activities from to  of approximately million  related primarily to the change in our inventory levels 
during fiscal year  we used cash to build our inventories by approximately million in anticipation of our move to agua prieta  whereas during fiscal year we generated approximately million in cash through reducing our inventory levels to help fund the construction of our new manufacturing facility 

table of contents cash flows from investing activities 
cash used for our investing activities  which relates primarily to capital expenditures  increased by million  or from million for fiscal year to million for fiscal year the increase in our capital expenditures relates primarily to our new apparel manufacturing facility located in agua prieta  mexico 
for contractual commitments remaining in connection with the construction of this facility see contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements section following in this report 
cash flows from financing activities 
we used million less in cash associated with our financing activities in fiscal year when compared to the same period last year 
we did not repay any debt in fiscal year ended  as compared to million during fiscal year ended we borrowed an additional million against our revolving credit line in fiscal relating to our inventory build of finished goods at our apparel segment 
stock repurchase on october   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock through a stock repurchase program 
under the board approved repurchase program  share purchases may be made from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions depending on market conditions  share price  trading volume and other factors  and such purchases  if any will be made in accordance with applicable insider trading and other securities laws and regulations 
these repurchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or from time to time without prior notice 
while no shares have been purchased this fiscal year under the program  as of february   there have been  shares of our common stock that have been purchased under the repurchase program at an average price per share of 
unrelated to the stock repurchase program  we purchased shares of common stock during the fiscal year ended february  credit facility on august   we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement the facility with a group of lenders led by bank of america  na the lenders 
the facility provides us access to million in revolving credit  which we may increase to million in certain circumstances  and matures on august  the facility bears interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus a spread ranging from to libor or at february  and at february   depending on our total funded debt to ebitda ratio  as defined 
as of february   we had million of borrowings under the revolving credit line and million outstanding under standby letters of credit arrangements  leaving us availability of approximately million 
the facility contains financial covenants  restrictions on capital expenditures  acquisitions  asset dispositions  and additional debt  as well as other customary covenants  such as total funded debt to ebitda ratio  as defined 
we are in compliance with all these covenants as of february  the facility is secured by substantially all of our domestic assets as well as all capital securities of each domestic subsidiary and of all capital securities of each direct foreign subsidiary 
during fiscal year  we borrowed million and we did not pay any additional amounts on the revolver 
it is anticipated that the available line of credit is sufficient to cover  should it be required  working capital required for the foreseeable future 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposures to interest rate fluctuations on our floating rate million revolving credit maturing august  we account for our derivatives as cash flow hedges and record them as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet  measure those instruments at fair value and recognize changes in the fair value of derivatives in earnings in the period of change  unless the derivative qualifies as an effective hedge that offsets certain exposures  at which time the changes in fair value would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
on july   we entered into a three year interest rate swap agreement swap for a notional amount of million 
the swap effectively fixes the libor rate at 
the swap was designated as a cash flow hedge  and the fair value at february  was million  million net of deferred taxes 
the swap was reported on the consolidated balance sheet in current installments of long term debt with a related deferred charge recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
pension we are required to make contributions to our defined benefit pension plan 
these contributions are required under the minimum funding requirements of the employee retirement income security act of erisa 
we anticipate that we will contribute from million to million during our next fiscal year 
we made contributions of million to our pension plan during each of our last fiscal years 
as our pension assets are invested in marketable securities  fluctuations in market values could potentially impact our funding status  associated liabilities recorded and future required minimum contributions 
at february   we had an unfunded pension liability recorded on our balance sheet of million 

table of contents inventories we believe our current inventory levels are sufficient to satisfy our customer demands and we anticipate having adequate sources of raw materials to meet future business requirements 
we have long term contracts in effect that govern prices  but do not require minimum volume with paper and yarn suppliers 
certain of our rebate programs do  however  require minimum purchase volumes 
management anticipates meeting the required volumes 
capital expenditures we expect our capital requirements for  exclusive of capital required for possible acquisitions and the completion of our new manufacturing facility in agua prieta  mexico  will be in line with our historical levels of between million and million 
we expect to fund these expenditures through existing cash flows 
we expect to generate sufficient cash flows from our operating activities to cover our operating and other normal capital requirements for our foreseeable future 
on june   we announced plans to build a new manufacturing facility in the town of agua prieta in the state of sonora  mexico 
at the time we estimated that the total capital expenditures associated with this facility would be between million and million million for the building and million million for machinery and equipment 
the construction of the new state of the art manufacturing facility is close to completion  with most of the new equipment installed 
to date we have spent approximately million 
we are now in the midst of transitioning both equipment and production from our existing manufacturing facility located in anaheim  ca to our new manufacturing facility 
we expect to be completed with this process by the end of the second quarter of this fiscal year 
we continue to expect that the remaining funding for this project will be provided by internal cash flow and  as required  by our existing credit facilities 
we expect this facility to be producing at million pounds per week by the end of the first fiscal quarter of and between to million pounds per week by the end of our second fiscal quarter with an estimated capacity of approximately to million pounds per week 
contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements there have been no significant changes in our contractual obligations since february  that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
we had no off balance sheet arrangements in place as of february  in thousands 
to total debt revolving credit facility interest rate swap debt and interest total other contractual commitments estimated pension benefit payments letters of credit operating leases construction contract agua prieta total other contractual commitments total subsequent to february  and through may   we made no additional repayments on our revolving credit facility 
we expect future interest payments of million for fiscal year  and million for fiscal year assuming interest rates and debt levels remain the same throughout the remaining term of the facility 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk cash we have significant amounts of cash at financial institutions that are in excess of federally insured limits 
with the current financial environment and the instability of financial institutions  we cannot be assured that we will not experience losses on our deposits 
interest rates we are exposed to interest rate risk on short term and long term financial instruments carrying variable interest rates 
we may from time to time utilize interest rate swaps to manage overall borrowing costs and reduce exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes 
our variable rate financial instruments  including the outstanding credit facilities  totaled million at february  we entered into a million interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge related to this debt 
the libor rate on million of debt is effectively fixed through this interest rate swap agreement 
the impact on our results of operations of a one point interest rate change on the outstanding balance of the variable rate financial instruments as of february  would be approximately million 
foreign exchange we have global operations and thus make investments and enter into transactions in various foreign currencies 
the value of our consolidated assets and liabilities located outside the united states translated at period end exchange rates and income and expenses translated using average rates prevailing during the period  generally denominated in pesos and canadian dollars  are affected by the translation into our reporting currency the us dollar 
such translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of shareholders equity
