we are currently evaluating acquisition opportunities in addition to those described above and we continue to seek new opportunities to further our growth strategy 
no assurances can be made that any of these opportunities will be determined to be appropriate or that they may be acquired on terms acceptable to us 
segments our business operates in four segments skilled nursing facilities snf  assisted living facilities alf  home health and management and development 
in our skilled nursing and assisted living segments  we operate  have ownership interests in or lease twenty one facilities for which we collect fees from the residents of those facilities 
profits losses are generated to the extent that the monthly patient fees exceed the costs associated with operating those facilities 
in our home health segment profits losses are generated to the extent that the monthly patient fees exceed the costs associated with providing services to patients in their homes 
in our management and development segment  we manage an aggregate of eight assisted living facilities  nursing homes and an independent living campus all of which are owned by third parties 
with respect to these facilities  we receive a management fee based on the revenue generated by the facilities 
within our management and development segment  we provide development  consulting and accounting services to third parties 
in these instances  we receive a fee for providing those services 
these fees vary from project to project  with the development fee in most cases being based on a percentage of the total cost to develop the project 
number of units owned leased managed for third parties total skilled nursing assisted living independent living total skilled nursing facility segment we focus on two primary indicators in evaluating the financial performance in this segment 
those indicators are facility occupancy and staffing 
facility staffing is important because payroll and related payroll costs represent approximately of our total operating costs 
staffing levels and the quality of staff are closely monitored by management to make sure costs are maintained within expected levels and to assure a high level of quality services 
facility occupancy is important as higher occupancy generally leads to higher revenue 
in addition  concentrating on increasing the number of medicare admissions helps in increasing revenue 
skilled nursing facilities average occupancy adcare average  december  adcare average  december  we continue our work towards maximizing the number of patients covered by medicare where our profit margins are typically higher 
for the year ended december   the percentage of patients covered by medicare in our skilled nursing facilities was compared to for the year ended december  we believe the current economic conditions that have contributed to our lower occupancies are also contributing to our lower number of medicare patients 
additionally  we believe hospitals may be responding to recent actions by the centers for medicare and medicaid services to review hospital admission decisions for medicare covered patients 
hospitals have responded to this increased scrutiny by only admitting the patients for observation thereby limiting a skilled nursing facility s ability to receive medicare coverage for patients admitted from hospitals 
we have undertaken several initiatives to improve census in our skilled nursing segment including bi weekly conference calls to discuss census development  advertising campaigns  a sales incentive system and multiple public events at facilities to increase community interaction and facility visibility 
additionally  we have added new sales marketing positions to consult with facility level sales staff on census development as well as make more marketing calls to places that can generate more medicare admissions such as hospitals and medical offices 
the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  adopted rules that decreased the aggregate medicare payments to skilled nursing facilities by approximately in federal fiscal year effective as of october   cms increased medicare rates for skilled nursing facilities by approximately for the federal fiscal year ending september   under a rule adding an annual update to account for inflation in the cost of goods and services 
cms then adopted rules recalibrating the medicare prospective payment categories for skilled nursing facilities for federal fiscal year the recalibration resulted in a decrease of approximately in projected skilled nursing facility payments  offset by an increase of approximately to account for inflation 
as a result  cms estimated that aggregate medicare payments were reduced by approximately in fiscal year medicare reimbursement rates and procedures are subject to change from time to time  which could materially impact our revenue 
medicare reimburses our skilled nursing facilities under a prospective payment system pps for certain inpatient covered services 
under the pps  facilities are paid a predetermined amount per patient  per day  based on the anticipated costs of treating patients 
the amount to be paid is determined by classifying each patient into a resource utilization group rug category that is based upon each patient s acuity level 
as of october   the rug categories were expanded from to with the introduction of mds should future changes in skilled nursing facility payments reduce rates or increase the standards for reaching certain reimbursement levels  our medicare revenues could be reduced  with a corresponding adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
the governor of the state of ohio is currently preparing the state biennial budget for the period covering while details of the budget proposal are not yet fully understood  the governor and his administration have made several negative overtures toward medicaid indicating that cuts in reimbursement to nursing homes are likely 
early estimates indicate to medicaid spending cuts in ohio could be as high as 
the budget process is just beginning so it is likely the final details of budget will not be known for some time 
at this time  no significant changes are anticipated in alabama and georgia 
for the year ended december   medicaid covered patients of our skilled nursing facilities comprised approximately of our total skilled nursing facility patients 
assisted living facility segment similar to our skilled nursing segment  in our assisted living segment  we focus on facility occupancy and staffing 
assisted living facilities average occupancy adcare average  december  adcare average  december  we believe the current economic conditions have contributed to the decline in occupancy 
residents of our assisted living facilities rely on their personal investments and wealth to pay for their stay 
recent declines in market values of investments could limit their ability to pay for services or shorten the period of time for which they can pay privately for their stay 
the depressed market for the sale of homes could limit their ability to sell their personal assets further reducing their ability to remain in our facilities 
furthermore  adult children who have recently become unemployed may decide to care for their parent at home so that their parent s income may help offset some of their own financial burdens 
we do not believe this is a trend and we believe facility occupancy will improve 
we have undertaken several initiatives to improve census in our assisted living segment including advertising campaigns  a sales incentive system and multiple public events at facilities to increase community interaction and facility visibility 
additionally  we have added a new sales marketing position to consult with facility level sales staff on census development 
home based care segment in addition to providing home health care services to patients in their homes  we are utilizing our home health services in our assisted living and independent living properties in ohio to create cross selling opportunities 
for the year ended december   the percentage of our home health patients covered by medicare has decreased to compared for the year ended december  while we have experienced recent declines in the number of patients we are serving for home health services  we don t believe this is a trend 
we have engaged a new marketing and sales employee for our home health segment to improve our referrals and increase the number of patients we are providing services to 
the center for medicare and medicaid services cms has made a across the board rate reduction for home health care services for  as well as a cut for additionally  cms has other initiatives directed towards reducing payment for home health care services 
medicare covered services comprise approximately of our home health total visits 
effective january   ohio job and family services medicaid made a reduction in reimbursement for home health services 
medicaid covered services comprise approximately of our home health total visits 
management  development and corporate segment we manage five skilled nursing facilities  two assisted living facilities and one independent living campus for third party owners 
additionally  we provide accounting services to one skilled nursing facility 
during the first quarter of  we added two skilled nursing facilities bringing the number of facilities managed to the current levels 
our contracts for these services are for either a fixed monthly fee or for a percentage of revenue generated by the managed facility 
depending on the type of contract  our revenues increase annually according to inflationary adjustments stipulated in our management agreements or they increase as the facility s revenue increases for the contracts that are based on a percentage of revenue 
consequently  management consulting and development fee revenue has increased  for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  this segment includes our corporate overhead expenses which are made up of salaries of senior management team members and various other corporate expenses including but not limited to corporate office operating expenses  audit fees  legal fees and board activities 
additionally  non cash charges for compensation expense related to warrants  restricted stock and stock options are included in corporate overhead 
we don t allocate these expenses to the divisions or separate them from management and development business for management review purposes

home health segment for the year ended december   revenue in our home based care segment declined approximately  as a result of fewer patients and fewer patients covered by medicare 
in addition  this segment experienced increased expenses from annual employee wage increases of approximately 
the decline in revenues and increases in expenses resulted in income from operations of approximately  which is  less than in the decrease in total assets was primarily the result of depreciation 
we have engaged a new marketing and sales employee for our home health segment to improve our referrals and increase the number of patients we are providing services to as well as to concentrate on improving our medicare referrals 
management  development and corporate segment management consulting and development fee revenue has increased  for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  net loss from operations was  due primarily to corporate overhead  costs for acquisitions and non cash charges for compensation expense related to warrants  restricted stock and employee stock options

on november   we established a  line of credit with huntington national bank to assist with cash flow 
on march   our lender increased this line of credit to  as of december   approximately  was used in operations of the company 
we have established a  line of credit using funds from our non qualified deferred compensation plan 
members of this plan  which is only available to senior management  authorized the transfer of funds to establish the line of credit with interest accruing at 
the funds are presently used in the operations of the company 
some of our properties are financed with loans secured by the department of housing and urban development hud 
these loans limit our use of the cash generated by the properties for purposes other than to fund the operations of the hud financed property 
in january and july each year  we are permitted to withdraw cash from these properties if a calculation of cash flow determines that the properties have generated cash in excess of what is needed to fund the expenses of the property in the short term

cash flow our cash requirements are satisfied primarily with cash generated from operating activities  financing activities and additional indebtedness 
our cash flow is dependent on our ability to collect accounts receivable in a timely manner 
the majority of our revenue is from medicaid and medicare programs 
these are reliable payment sources which make our likelihood of collection very high 
however  the time it takes to receive payment on a claim from these sources can take up to several months 
on average  accounts receivable were outstanding approximately days before collection as of december  and days as of december  the status of accounts receivable collections is monitored very closely by our senior management

net cash provided by financing activities was approximately  for the year ended december   primarily as a result of proceeds from the debt and from the sale of stock partially offset by routine principal payments on existing loans 
inflation the resident fees that we receive from the properties that we own or lease and the management fees we receive from the facilities we manage for third parties are our primary sources of income 
this source of income is affected by the monthly rental rates and the occupancy rates 
the monthly rental rates are dependent on various factors including competition  market conditions and the locations of the properties 
we evaluate and prepare budgets for our properties on an annual basis 
at that time  we assess the impact of inflation on the operations of the properties  including but not limited to  budgeting increases for real estate taxes  utilities  employee expenses  food and supplies 
however  some factors are difficult to quantify  such as potential increases in employee expenses as a result of the current shortage of qualified nurses  and there can be no assurance that the resident rental rates will increase or that costs will not increase due to inflation or other causes 
we strive to be the provider of choice in each of our markets and to charge market or better than market rates 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience  business knowledge and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time 
actual results may vary from our estimates 
these estimates are evaluated by management and revised as circumstances change 
we believe that the following are critical accounting policies our financial statements reflect consolidation with entities in which we have determined to have a controlling financial interest arrangements with other business enterprises are evaluated  and those in which adcare is determined to have controlling financial interest are consolidated 
asc topic  consolidation addresses the consolidation of business enterprises to which the usual condition of consolidation ownership of a majority voting interest does not apply 
this interpretation focuses on controlling financial interests that may be achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests 
it concludes that  in absences of clear control through voting interests  a company s exposure variable interest to the economic risks and potential rewards from the variable interest entity s assets and activities are the best evidence of control 
if an enterprise holds a majority of the variable interests of an entity  it would be considered the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the assets  liabilities and results of operations of the variable interest entity in its financial statements 
on march   the company obtained full control of its previously consolidated variable interest entities community hearth home and hearth home of urbana by acquiring the remaining noncontrolling equity interests 
as such  these entities are no longer considered variable interest entities and are consolidated as wholly owned subsidiaries 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about the acquisition 
adcare has evaluated its relationship with riverchase village adk  llc riverchase 
even though the company does not have any equity interest in riverchase  it was determined that riverchase is a variable interest entity as it does not have sufficient equity at risk 
given the related party relationship with the common shareholder and certain other variable interests with riverchase  the company determined that it is the primary beneficiary and consolidation of riverchase is required 
as such  the company initially consolidated riverchase on june   the date of acquisition and initial operations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our variable interest entities 
patient care receivables patient care receivables are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts 
the administrators and managers of our properties evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on a monthly basis  and adjustments are made if necessary 
on an ongoing basis  we have experienced very few collection problems and do not anticipate significant increases unless the economy where our properties are located encounters a severe down trend 
approximately of our revenue in our nursing facilities is derived from medicare and medicaid qualifying residents 
charges to these payers are evaluated monthly to insure that revenue is recorded properly and that any adjustments necessitated by our contractual arrangement with these payers are recorded in the month incurred 
asset impairment we evaluate our property  equipment and other long lived assets  other than goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles  on an annual basis to determine if facts and circumstances suggest that the assets may be impaired or that the estimated depreciable life of the asset may need to be changed such as significant physical changes in the property  significant adverse changes in general economic conditions  and significant deteriorations of the underlying cash flows or fair values of the property 
the need to recognize impairment is based on estimated future cash flows from a property compared to the carrying value of that property 
if recognition of impairment is necessary  it is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the property exceeds the fair value of the property 
for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles  we perform an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year or earlier if there are indications of potential impairment 
we have no assets recorded at fair value  however  our asset impairment analysis is consistent with the fair value measurements described in the accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures 
we did not record any asset impairments in or if our estimates or assumptions with respect to a property change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges for our assets 
business combinations effective january   we adopted the new accounting guidance on business combinations which established principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree as well as the goodwill acquired or gain recognized in a bargain purchase 
the new guidance also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
during  we expensed approximately  in acquisition costs related to the transaction discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
under the business combination accounting guidance in effect prior to january   these costs were considered part of the purchase price and as such were capitalized  but effective january  the accounting guidance required these costs be expensed as incurred 
both the current and previous guidance require that we make certain valuations to determine the fair value of assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
these valuations are subject to retroactive adjustment during the twelve month period subsequent to the acquisition date 
such valuations require us to make significant estimates  judgments and assumptions  including projections of future events and operating performance 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation cost for all share based payments granted after january  on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
we calculated the recognized and unrecognized stock based compensation using the black scholes merton option valuation method  which requires us to use certain key assumptions to develop the fair value estimates
