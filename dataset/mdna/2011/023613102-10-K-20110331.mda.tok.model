indiana commercial banks may acquire or establish subsidiaries that engage in activities permitted to be performed by the commercial bank itself  or permitted to operating subsidiaries of national banks 
under fdic regulations  a subsidiary of a state bank may not engage as principal in any activity that is not of a type permissible for a subsidiary of a national bank unless the fdic determines that the activity does not impose a significant risk to the affected insurance fund 
regulation and supervision the company expects competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry 
technological advances  for example  have lowered barriers to entry  allowed banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the internet and made it possible for non depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks 
changes in federal law permit affiliation among banks  securities firms and insurance companies  which promotes a competitive environment in the financial services industry 
competition for deposits and the origination of loans could limit the company s growth in the future 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of the dodd frank act made comprehensive changes in the regulation of financial companies 
certain of these legislative changes are addressed in the following summary of the regulation and supervision of the company and the bank 
regulation and supervision of the company general 
the company is a public company registered with the securities and exchange commission the sec  whose common stock trades on the nasdaq stock market llc and is a bank holding company subject to regulation by the federal reserve board under the bank holding company act  as amended bhca 
as a result  the activities of the company are subject to certain requirements and limitations  which are described below 
as a public reporting company  the company is required to file annual  quarterly and current reports with the sec 
as a bank holding company  the company is required to file annual and quarterly reports with the federal reserve board and to furnish such additional information as the federal reserve board may require pursuant to the bhca 
the company is also subject to regular examination by the federal reserve board 
dividends 
the federal reserve board has the power to prohibit dividends by bank holding companies if their actions constitute unsafe or unsound practices 
the federal reserve board has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies  which expresses the federal reserve board s view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the company s capital needs  asset quality and overall financial condition 
the federal reserve board also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a bank holding company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends 
under the prompt corrective action regulations adopted by the federal reserve board  the federal reserve board may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company s bank subsidiary is classified as undercapitalized 
see regulation and supervision of the bank prompt corrective regulatory action 
the federal reserve board has long had a policy under which bank holding companies are required to serve as a source of strength for their depository subsidiaries by providing capital  liquidity and other resources in times of financial distress 
the dodd frank act codified the source of strength doctrine and required the issuance of implementing regulations 
stock repurchases 
as a bank holding company  the company is required to give the federal reserve board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption  when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding months  is equal to or more of the company s consolidated net worth 
the federal reserve board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would violate any law  regulation  federal reserve board order  directive  or any condition imposed by  or written agreement with  the federal reserve board 
this requirement does not apply to bank holding companies that are well capitalized  well managed and are not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues 
acquisitions 
the company is required to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve board to acquire all  or substantially all  of the assets of any bank or bank holding company or merge with another bank holding company 
prior federal reserve board approval will also be required for the company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if  after giving effect to such acquisition  the company would  directly or indirectly  own or control more than of any class of voting shares of such bank or bank holding company 
in evaluating such transactions  the federal reserve board considers such matters as the financial and managerial resources of and future prospects of the companies involved  competitive factors and the convenience and needs of the communities to be served 
bank holding companies may acquire additional banks in any state  subject to certain restrictions such as deposit concentration limits 
with certain exceptions  the bhca prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of a company that is not a bank or a bank holding company  or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking  managing or controlling banks  or providing services for its subsidiaries 
the principal exceptions to these prohibitions involve certain non bank activities  which  by statute or by federal reserve board regulation or order  have been identified as activities closely related to the business of banking 
the activities of the company are subject to these legal and regulatory limitations under the bhca and the related federal reserve board regulations 
the gramm leach bliley act of authorized a bank holding company that meets specified conditions  including its depository institution subsidiaries being well capitalized and well managed  to opt to become a financial holding company  and thereby engage in a broader array of financial activities than previously permitted 
such activities can include insurance underwriting and investment banking 
the dodd frank act added the requirements that the holding company itself be well capitalized and well managed 
the company has not  up to this time  opted to become a financial holding company 
the federal reserve board has the power to order a holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity  or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary  when it has reasonable cause to believe that the continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety  soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that holding company 
under the change in bank control act of the cbca  a day prior written notice must be submitted to the federal reserve board if any person including a company  or any group acting in concert  seeks to acquire of any class of the company s outstanding voting securities  unless the federal reserve board determines that such acquisition will not result in a change of control of the bank 
under the cbca  the federal reserve board has days within which to act on such notice taking into consideration certain factors  including the financial and managerial resources of the proposed acquiror  the convenience and needs of the community served by the bank and the antitrust effects of an acquisition 
under the bhca  any company would be required to obtain prior approval from the federal reserve board before it may obtain control of the company within the meaning of the bhca 
control for bhca purposes generally is defined to mean the ownership or power to vote or more of any class of the company s voting securities or the ability to control in any manner the election of a majority of the company s directors 
an existing bank holding company would be required to obtain the federal reserve board s prior approval under the bhca before acquiring more than of the company s voting stock 
under indiana banking law  prior approval of the indiana department of financial institutions is also required before any person may acquire control of an indiana bank or bank holding company 
the department will issue a notice approving the transaction if it determines that the persons proposing to acquire the indiana bank or bank holding company are qualified in character  experience and financial responsibility  and the transaction does not jeopardize the interests of the public 
capital requirements 
the federal reserve board has adopted guidelines regarding the capital adequacy of bank holding companies  which require bank holding companies to maintain on a consolidated basis  specified minimum ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk weighted assets 
these requirements  which generally apply to bank holding companies with consolidated assets of million or more  are substantially similar to  but somewhat more generous than  those applicable to the bank 
see regulation and supervision of the bank capital requirements 
the dodd frank act required the federal reserve board to adopt consolidated capital requirements for holding companies that are equally as stringent as those applicable to the depository institution subsidiaries 
that means that certain instruments that had previously been includable in tier capital for bank holding companies  such as trust preferred securities  will no longer be eligible for inclusion 
the revised capital requirements are subject to certain grandfathering and transition rules 
regulation and supervision of the bank general 
the bank  as an indiana chartered commercial bank  is subject to extensive regulation by the indiana department of financial institutions and the fdic 
the lending activities and other investments of the bank must comply with various regulatory requirements 
the indiana department of financial institutions and fdic periodically examine the bank for compliance with various regulatory requirements 
the bank must file reports with the indiana department of financial institutions and the fdic describing its activities and financial condition 
the bank is also subject to certain reserve requirements promulgated by the federal reserve board 
this supervision and regulation is intended primarily for the protection of depositors 
certain of these regulatory requirements are referred to below or appear elsewhere in this form k 
the regulatory discussion  however  does not purport to be an exhaustive treatment of applicable laws and regulations and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual statutes and regulations 
the bank s conversion from an indiana savings bank to an indiana commercial bank has not materially changed the regulatory requirements applicable to the bank 
the dodd frank act provides for the establishment of the consumer financial protection bureau as an independent bureau of the federal reserve board 
the consumer financial protection bureau will assume responsibility for implementing federal consumer financial protection and fair lending laws and regulations  a function currently handled by federal bank regulatory agencies 
however  institutions of billion or less in total assets will continue to be examined for compliance by  and subject to the enforcement authority of  the federal bank regulator 
federal banking law capital requirements 
under fdic regulations  state chartered banks that are not members of the federal reserve system are required to maintain a minimum leverage capital requirement consisting of a ratio of tier capital to total assets of if the fdic determines that the institution is not anticipating or experiencing significant growth and has well diversified risk  including no undue interest rate risk exposure  excellent asset quality  high liquidity  good earnings  and in general  a strong banking organization  rated composite under the uniform financial institutions rating system the camels rating system established by the federal financial institutions examination council 
for all but the most highly rated institutions meeting the conditions set forth above  the minimum leverage capital ratio is 
tier capital is the sum of common stockholders equity  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock including any related surplus and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries  minus all intangible assets other than certain mortgage and certain other servicing assets  purchased credit card relationships  credit enhancing interest only strips and certain deferred tax assets  identified losses  investments in certain financial subsidiaries and non financial equity investments 
in addition to the leverage capital ratio the ratio of tier i capital to total assets  state chartered nonmember banks must maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets of at least  of which at least half must be tier capital 
qualifying total capital consists of tier capital plus tier capital also referred to as supplementary capital items 
tier capital items include allowances for loan losses in an amount of up to of risk weighted assets  cumulative preferred stock and preferred stock with a maturity of over years  certain other capital instruments and up to of pre tax net unrealized holding gains on equity securities 
the includable amount of tier capital cannot exceed the institution s tier capital 
qualifying total capital is further reduced by the amount of the bank s investments in banking and finance subsidiaries that are not consolidated for regulatory capital purposes  reciprocal cross holdings of capital securities issued by other banks  most intangible assets and certain other deductions 
under the fdic risk weighted system  all of a bank s balance sheet assets and the credit equivalent amounts of certain off balance sheet items are assigned to one of four broad risk weight categories from to  based on the regulators perception of the risks inherent in the type of assets or item 
the aggregate dollar amount of each category is multiplied by the risk weight assigned to that category 
the sum of these weighted values equals the bank s risk weighted assets 
at december   the bank s ratio of tier capital to average total assets was  its ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets was and its ratio of total risk based capital to risk weighted assets was 
investment activities 
since the enactment of federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act  all state chartered fdic insured banks have generally been limited in their activities as principal and their equity investments to the type and in the amount authorized for national banks  notwithstanding state law 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act and the fdic regulations permit exceptions to these limitations 
the fdic is authorized to permit such institutions to engage in state authorized activities or investments not permissible for national banks other than non subsidiary equity investments if they meet all applicable capital requirements and it is determined that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the deposit insurance fund 
the fdic has adopted regulations governing the procedures for institutions seeking approval to engage in such activities or investments 
the gramm leach bliley act of specifies that a non member bank may control a subsidiary that engages in activities as principal that would only be permitted for a national bank to conduct in a financial subsidiary if a bank meets specified conditions and deducts its investment in the subsidiary for regulatory capital purposes 
interstate banking and branching 
the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of permitted bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state subject to specified concentration limits and other conditions 
the interstate banking act also authorizes the interstate merger of banks 
in addition  among other things  the interstate banking act  as amended by the dodd frank act  permits banks to establish de novo branches on an interstate basis provided that state banks chartered by the target state are permitted to establish de novo branches in the state 
dividend limitations 
the bank may not pay dividends on its capital stock if its regulatory capital would thereby be reduced below the amount then required for the liquidation account established for the benefit of certain depositors of the bank at the time of its conversion to stock form 
in addition  the bank may not pay dividends that exceed retained net income for the applicable calendar year to date  plus retained net income for the preceding two years without prior approval from the indiana department of financial institutions 
on july   following a joint examination by and discussions with the fdic and the indiana department of financial institutions  the board of directors of the bank adopted a resolution agreeing to  among other things  receive prior approval of the fdic and the indiana department of financial institutions before declaring or paying any dividends 
at december   the shareholders equity of the bank was million 
earnings of the bank appropriated to bad debt reserves and deducted for federal income tax purposes are not available for payment of cash dividends or other distributions to stockholders without payment of taxes at the then current tax rate by the bank on the amount of earnings removed from the reserves for such distributions 
see federal and state taxation 
under fdic regulations  the bank is prohibited from making any capital distributions if  after making the distribution  the bank would fail to meet any applicable capital requirements 
for additional information about dividend limitations see note in the consolidated financial statements 
insurance of deposit accounts 
under the federal deposit insurance corporation s risk based assessment system  insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations  regulatory capital levels and certain other factors  with less risky institutions paying lower assessments 
an institution s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned  and certain potential adjustments established by federal deposit insurance corporation regulations 
effective april   assessment rates range from seven to basis points of assessable deposits 
the dodd frank act required the federal deposit insurance corporation to amend its procedures to base assessments on total assets less tangible equity rather than deposits 
the federal deposit insurance corporation approved a final rule in february that will implement that directive in the second quarter of the federal deposit insurance may adjust the scale uniformly from one quarter to the next  except that no adjustment can deviate more than three basis points from the base scale without notice and comment 
no institution may pay a dividend if in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment 
the federal deposit insurance corporation imposed on all insured institutions a special emergency assessment of five basis points of total assets minus tier capital as of june   capped at ten basis points of an institution s deposit assessment base  to cover losses to the deposit insurance fund 
that special assessment  in the amount of  was collected on september  the federal deposit insurance corporation provided for similar assessments during the final two quarters of  if deemed necessary 
however  in lieu of further special assessments  the federal deposit insurance corporation required insured institutions to prepay estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of through the fourth quarter of such amount was million for the bank 
the estimated assessments  which include an assumed annual assessment base increase of  were recorded as a prepaid expense asset as of december  as of december   and each quarter thereafter  a charge to earnings will be recorded for each regular assessment with an offsetting credit to the prepaid asset 
due to the recent difficult economic conditions  deposit insurance per account owner has been raised to  that limit was made permanent by the dodd frank act 
in addition  the federal deposit insurance corporation adopted an optional temporary liquidity guarantee program by which  for a fee  noninterest bearing transaction accounts would receive unlimited insurance coverage until september   subsequently extended to december   with an additional extension to december   and certain senior unsecured debt issued by institutions and their holding companies between october  and october  would be guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation through june   or in some cases  december  the bank initially elected to participate in the unlimited noninterest bearing transaction account coverage program  and subsequently opted out effective december  the bank and the company both participated in the unsecured debt guarantee program  but issued no debt under the program 
the dodd frank act adopted mandatory unlimited coverage for certain noninterest bearing transaction accounts from january  until december  in addition to the assessment for deposit insurance  institutions are required to make payments on bonds issued in the late s by the financing corporation to recapitalize a predecessor deposit insurance fund 
that payment is established quarterly and during the four quarters ended december  averaged basis points of assessable deposits 
these financing corporation payments will continue until the bonds mature in through the dodd frank act increased the minimum target deposit insurance fund ratio from of estimated insured deposits to of estimated insured deposits 
the federal deposit insurance corporation must seek to achieve the ratio by september  insured institutions with assets of billion or more are supposed to fund the increase 
the dodd frank act eliminated the maximum fund ratio  instead leaving it to the discretion of the federal deposit insurance corporation  and the federal deposit insurance corporation recently exercised that discretion by establishing a long range fund ratio of the fdic has authority to increase insurance assessments 
a significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the bank 
management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future 
insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order or condition imposed by the fdic 
the management of the bank does not know of any practice  condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance 
prompt corrective regulatory action 
the federal banking regulators are required to take prompt corrective action if an insured depository institution fails to satisfy certain minimum capital requirements  including a leverage limit  a risk based capital requirement and any other measure deemed appropriate by the federal banking regulators for measuring the capital adequacy of an insured depository institution 
all institutions  regardless of their capital levels  are restricted from making any capital distribution or paying any management fees if the institution would thereafter fail to satisfy the minimum levels for any of its capital requirements 
an institution that fails to meet the minimum level for any relevant capital measure an undercapitalized institution may be i subject to increased monitoring by the appropriate federal banking regulator  ii required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan within days  iii subject to asset growth limits  and iv required to obtain prior regulatory approval for acquisitions  branching and new lines of businesses 
the capital restoration plan must include a guarantee by the institution s holding company that the institution will comply with the plan until it has been adequately capitalized on average for four consecutive quarters  under which the holding company would be liable up to the lesser of of the institution s total assets or the amount necessary to bring the institution into capital compliance as of the date it failed to comply with its capital restoration plan 
a significantly undercapitalized institution  as well as any undercapitalized institution that does not submit an acceptable capital restoration plan  may be subject to regulatory demands for recapitalization  broader application of restrictions on transactions with affiliates  limitations on interest rates paid on deposits  asset growth and other activities  possible replacement of directors and officers  and restrictions on capital distributions by any bank holding company controlling the institution 
any company controlling the institution may also be required to divest the institution or the institution could be required to divest subsidiaries 
the senior executive officers of a significantly undercapitalized institution may not receive bonuses or increases in compensation without prior approval and the institution is prohibited from making payments of principal or interest on its subordinated debt 
at their discretion  the federal banking regulators may also impose the foregoing sanctions on an undercapitalized institution if the regulators determine that such actions are necessary to carry out the purposes of the prompt corrective provisions 
if an institution s ratio of tangible capital to total assets falls below the critically undercapitalized level established by law  ie  a ratio of tangible equity to total assets of or less  the institution will be subject to conservatorship or receivership within specified time periods 
tangible equity is defined as core capital plus cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus less all intangible assets other than qualifying supervisory goodwill and certain purchased mortgage servicing rights 
under the implementing regulations  the federal banking regulators generally measure an institution s capital adequacy on the basis of its total risk based capital ratio the ratio of its total capital to risk weighted assets  tier risk based capital ratio the ratio of its core capital to risk weighted assets and leverage ratio the ratio of its core capital to adjusted total assets 
the following table shows the capital ratios required for the various prompt corrective action categories 
adequately significantly well capitalized capitalized undercapitalized undercapitalized total risk based capital ratio or more or more less than less than tier risk based capital ratio or more or more less than less than tier leverage ratio or more or more less than less than if institution has a composite camels rating 
the fdic may reclassify a well capitalized depository institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with the supervisory actions applicable to institutions in the next lower capital category but may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized if the fdic determines  after notice and an opportunity for a hearing  that the savings institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or that the institution has received and not corrected a less than satisfactory rating for any camels rating category 
safety and soundness guidelines 
each federal banking agency was required to establish safety and soundness standards for the depository institutions under its authority 
the interagency guidelines require depository institutions to maintain internal controls and information systems and internal audit systems that are appropriate for the size  nature and scope of the institution s business 
the guidelines also establish certain basic standards for loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate risk exposure and asset growth 
the guidelines further provide that depository institutions should maintain safeguards to prevent the payment of compensation  fees and benefits that are excessive or that could lead to material financial loss  and should take into account factors such as compensation practices at comparable institutions 
if the appropriate federal banking agency determines that a depository institution is not in compliance with the safety and soundness guidelines  it may require the institution to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the guidelines 
a depository institution must submit an acceptable compliance plan to its primary federal regulator within days of receipt of a request for such a plan 
failure to submit or implement a compliance plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions 
management believes that the bank meets all the standards adopted in the interagency guidelines 
enforcement 
the fdic has extensive enforcement authority over nonmember insured state banks  including the bank 
this enforcement authority includes  among other things  the ability to assess civil money penalties  issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers 
in general  these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices 
the fdic has authority under federal law to appoint a conservator or receiver for an insured bank under limited circumstances 
the fdic is required  with certain exceptions  to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state non member bank if that banks was critically undercapitalized on average during the calendar quarter beginning days after the date on which the institution became critically undercapitalized

reserve requirements 
under federal reserve board regulations  the bank currently must maintain average daily reserves equal to on aggregate transaction accounts up to and including million  plus on the remainder 
the first million of transaction accounts are exempt 
this percentage is subject to adjustment by the federal reserve board 
because required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash or in a noninterest bearing account at a federal reserve bank  the effect of the reserve requirement is to reduce the amount of the institution s interest earning assets 
at december   the bank met applicable federal reserve board reserve requirements 
federal home loan bank system 
the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank system  which consists of regional federal home loan banks governed and regulated by the federal housing finance board fhfb 
as a member  the bank is required to purchase and hold stock in the fhlb of indianapolis 
as of december   the bank held stock in the fhlb of indianapolis in the amount of million and was in compliance with the above requirement 
the fhlb of indianapolis serves as a reserve or central bank for the member institutions within its assigned region 
it is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of fhlb system 
it makes loans ie  advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the fhlb system and the board of directors of the fhlb of indianapolis

in addition  section of the bhca prohibits extensions of credit to executive officers  directors  and greater than stockholders of a depository institution by any other institution which has a correspondent banking relationship with the institution  unless such extension of credit is on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 
transactions with affiliates

the bhca further prohibits a depository institution from extending credit to or offering any other services  or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service  on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or certain of its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution  subject to certain limited exceptions 
indiana banking law branching 
an indiana bank is entitled to establish one or more branches de novo or by acquisition in any location or locations in indiana and in other states subject to the requirements of federal law for interstate banking 
the bank is required to file an application with the department of financial institutions 
approval of the application is contingent upon the department s determination that after the establishment of the branch  the bank will have adequate capital  sound management and adequate future earnings 
an application to branch must also be approved by the fdic 
lending limits 
indiana banks are not subject to percentage of asset or capital limits on their commercial  consumer and non residential mortgage lending  and accordingly  have more flexibility in structuring their portfolios than federally chartered savings banks 
indiana law provides that a bank may not make a loan or extend credit to a borrower or group of borrowers in excess of of its unimpaired capital and surplus 
an additional of capital and surplus may be lent if secured by specified readily marketable collateral 
enforcement 
the department has authority to take enforcement action against an indiana bank in appropriate cases  including the issuance of cease and desist orders  removal of directors or officers  issuance of civil money penalties and appointment of a conservator or receiver 
other activities 
the bank is authorized to engage in a variety of agency and fiduciary activities including acting as executors of an estate  transfer agent and in other fiduciary capacities 
on approval from the department of financial institutions  the bank would be permitted to exercise any right granted to national banks 
regulatory restructuring legislation 
on july   president obama signed in law the dodd frank act  which is legislation that restructures the regulation of depository institutions 
in addition to creating the consumer financial protection bureau  the dodd frank act  among other things  requires changes in the way that institutions are assessed for deposit insurance  authorizes the payment of interest on business checking accounts  mandates the imposition of consolidated capital requirements on holding companies that are less stringent than those applicable to the subsidiary institution  requires that originators of securitized loans retain a percentage of the risk for the transferred loans  requires the federal reserve board to regulate pricing of certain debit card interchange fees  reduces the federal preemption afforded to national banks and federal savings associations and contains a number of reforms related to mortgage origination 
many of the provisions of the dodd frank act contain delayed effective dates and require the issuance of regulations 
consequently  it will be some time before their impact on operations can be assessed by management 
however  there is a significant possibility that the dodd frank act will  at a minimum  result in an increased regulatory burden and higher compliance  operating  and possibly  interest expense costs for the company and the bank 
federal taxation 
the company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return on a calendar year end 
banks are subject to the provisions of the internal revenue code of the code in the same general manner as other corporations 
however  institutions  such as the bank  which met certain definitional tests and other conditions prescribed by the code benefited from certain favorable provisions regarding their deductions from taxable income for annual additions to their bad debt reserve 
the company s federal income tax returns have not been audited in the past five years 
state taxation 
the state of indiana imposes a franchise tax which is assessed on qualifying financial institutions  such as the bank 
the tax is based upon federal taxable income before net operating loss carryforward deductions adjusted for certain indiana modifications and is levied at a rate of of apportioned adjusted taxable income 
the company s state income tax returns for the years ended december   and were audited in and no additional taxes were assessed as a result of the audit

risk factors an investment in shares of our common stock involves various risks 
before deciding to invest in our common stock  you should carefully consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information in this form k  including the items included as exhibits 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by any of the following risks or by other risks that have not been identified or that we may believe are immaterial or unlikely 
the value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks 
the risks discussed below also include forward looking statements  and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
our increased emphasis on commercial lending may expose us to increased lending risk 
at december   our loan portfolio consisted of million  or  of commercial real estate loans  million  or  of construction loans primarily commercial properties  and million  or  of commercial and industrial loans and leases 
we intend to continue to maintain our emphasis on the origination of commercial loans 
however  these types of loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non payment and loss than one to four family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property  the income stream of the borrowers and  for construction loans  the accuracy of the estimate of the property s value at completion of construction and the estimated cost of construction 
commercial and construction loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one to four family residential mortgage loans 
commercial and industrial loans expose us to additional risks since they typically are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayments from the cash flows of the borrower s business and are secured by non real estate collateral that may depreciate over time 
in addition  since such loans generally entail greater risk than one to four family residential mortgage loans  we may need to increase our allowance for loan losses to account for the likely increase in probable incurred credit losses associated with the growth of such loans 
also  many of our commercial and construction borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us 
consequently  an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one to four family residential mortgage loan 
we may be required to increase our provision for loan losses and to charge off additional loans in the future  each of which could adversely affect our results of operations 
further  our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio 
for  we recorded a provision for loan losses of million 
we also recorded net loan charge offs of million 
the recent economic recession has contributed to the relatively high levels of loan delinquencies and nonperforming assets as of december  our nonperforming loans totaled million  representing of total loans 
in addition  loans that we have classified as substandard totaled million  representing of total loans 
if these loans do not perform according to their terms and the collateral is insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance  we may experience loan losses  which could have a material effect on our operating results 
like all financial institutions  we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety 
we believe that our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the corresponding balance sheet date 
however  our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses  and future provisions for loan losses could materially adversely affect our operating results 
in evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses  we consider numerous quantitative factors  including our historical charge off experience  growth of our loan portfolio  changes in the composition of our loan portfolio and the volume of delinquent and classified loans 
in addition  we use information about specific borrower situations  including their financial position and estimated collateral values  to estimate the risk and amount of loss for those borrowers 
finally  we also consider many qualitative factors  including general and economic business conditions  current general market collateral valuations  trends apparent in any of the factors we take into account and other matters  which are by nature more subjective and fluid 
our estimates of the risk of loss and amount of loss on any loan are complicated by the significant uncertainties surrounding our borrowers abilities to successfully execute their business models through changing economic environments  competitive challenges and other factors 
because of the degree of uncertainty and susceptibility of these factors to change  our actual losses may vary from our current estimates 
at december   our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 
our regulators  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses charged to expense  or to decrease our allowance for loan losses by recognizing loan charge offs  net of recoveries 
any such additional provisions for loan losses or charge offs  as required by these regulatory agencies  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the economic recession could result in increases in our level of non performing loans and or reduce demand for our products and services  which would lead to lower revenue  higher loan losses and lower earnings 
our business activities and earnings are affected by general business conditions in the united states and in our local market area 
these conditions include short term and long term interest rates  inflation  unemployment levels  monetary supply  consumer confidence and spending  fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets  and the strength of the economy in the united states generally and in our market area in particular 
the national economy has recently experienced a recession  with rising unemployment levels  declines in real estate values and an erosion in consumer confidence 
dramatic declines in the us housing market over the past few years  with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures  have negatively affected the performance of mortgage loans and resulted in significant write downs of asset values by many financial institutions  including the bank 
a prolonged or more severe economic downturn  continued elevated levels of unemployment  further declines in the values of real estate  or other events that affect household and or corporate incomes could further impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans in accordance with their terms 
nearly all of our loans are secured by real estate or made to businesses in central indiana 
as a result of this concentration  a prolonged or more severe downturn in the local economy could result in significant increases in nonperforming loans  which would negatively impact our interest income and result in higher provisions for loan losses  which would hurt our earnings 
continuation of the economic downturn could also result in reduced demand for credit or fee based products and services  which would hurt our revenues 
our cost of operations is high relative to our assets 
our failure to maintain or reduce our operating expenses costs could hurt our profits 
our operating expenses  which consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy  furniture and equipment expense  professional fees  data processing expense  fdic insurance premiums and assessments  and marketing  totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  we continue our concerted effort to effectively manage our expenses 
our efficiency ratio totaled for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  failure to control our expenses could hurt future profits 
changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income and earnings 
our net interest income is the interest we earn on loans and investment less the interest we pay on our deposits and borrowings 
our net interest margin is the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and our other sources of funding 
changes in interest rates up or down could adversely affect our net interest margin and  as a result  our net interest income 
although the yield we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates  one can rise or fall faster than the other  causing our net interest margin to expand or contract 
our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets  so they may adjust faster in response to changes in interest rates 
as a result  when interest rates rise  our funding costs may rise faster than the yield we earn on our assets  causing our net interest margin to contract until the yield catches up 
changes in the slope of the yield curve or the spread between short term and long term interest rates could also reduce our net interest margin 
normally  the yield curve is upward sloping  meaning short term rates are lower than long term rates 
because our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets  when the yield curve flattens or even inverts  we could experience pressure on our net interest margin as our cost of funds increases relative to the yield we can earn on our assets 
the building of market share through our branching strategy could cause our expenses to increase faster than revenues 
we opened a full service banking center in fishers  indiana in october  a second banking center in carmel in december and a third in westfield in may we also purchased property in plainfield in with the expectation to begin construction on a new full service banking center  but those plans were put on hold until such time it is determined that the economy and other conditions warrant the required investment 
there are considerable costs involved in opening branches and new branches generally require a period of time to generate sufficient revenues to offset their costs  especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence 
accordingly  any new branch can be expected to negatively impact our earnings for some period of time until the branch reaches certain economies of scale 
recently enacted regulatory reform may have a material impact on our operations 
on july   the president signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act 
the dodd frank act contains various provisions designed to enhance the regulation of depository institutions and prevent the recurrence of a financial crisis such as occurred in these include provisions strengthening holding company capital requirements  requiring retention of a portion of the risk of securitized loans and regulating debit card interchange fees 
the dodd frank act also creates a new federal agency to administer consumer protection and fair lending laws  a function that is now performed by the depository institution regulators 
the full impact of the dodd frank act on our business and operations will not be known for years until regulations implementing the statute are written and adopted 
the dodd frank act may have a material impact on our operations  particularly through increased regulatory burden and compliance costs 
increased and or special fdic assessments will hurt our earnings 
the recent economic recession has caused a high level of bank failures  which has dramatically increased fdic resolution costs and led to a significant reduction in the balance of the deposit insurance fund 
as a result  the fdic has significantly increased the initial base assessment rates paid by financial institutions for deposit insurance 
increases in the base assessment rate have increased our deposit insurance costs and negatively impacted our earnings 
in addition  in may  the fdic imposed a special assessment on all insured institutions 
our special assessment  which was reflected in earnings for the quarter ended june   was  in lieu of imposing an additional special assessment  the fdic required all institutions to prepay their assessments for all of  and  which for us totaled million 
additional increases in the base assessment rate or additional special assessments would negatively impact our earnings 
strong competition within our market area could hurt our profits and slow growth 
we face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits 
this competition has made it more difficult for us to make new loans and has occasionally forced us to offer higher deposit rates 
price competition for loans and deposits might result in us earning less on our loans and paying more on our deposits  which reduces net interest income 
according to the fdic  as of june   we held of the deposits in henry county  indiana  which was the second largest market share of deposits out of the six financial institutions that held deposits in this county 
we also held of the deposits in hancock county  indiana  which was the fourth largest market share of deposits out of the financial institutions that held deposits in this county 
some of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer services that we do not provide 
we expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry 
our profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our market area 
we operate in a highly regulated environment and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations 
the bank is subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by the indiana department of financial institutions  its chartering authority  and by the fdic  as insurer of its deposits 
the company is subject to regulation and supervision by the federal reserve board 
such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage  and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and for the depositors and borrowers of the bank 
the regulation and supervision by the indiana department of financial institutions and the fdic are not intended to protect the interests of investors in the company s common stock 
regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities  including the imposition of restrictions on our operations  the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses 
any change in such regulation and oversight  whether in the form of regulatory policy  regulations  legislation or supervisory action  may have a material impact on our operations 
the trading history of our common stock is characterized by low trading volume 
our common stock may be subject to sudden decreases 
although our common stock trades on the nasdaq global market  it has not been regularly traded 
we cannot predict whether a more active trading market in our common stock will occur or how liquid that market might become 
a public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth  liquidity and orderliness depends upon the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time  which presence is dependent upon the individual decisions of investors  over which we have no control 
the market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors  including  but not limited to  the factors discussed in other risk factors and the following actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in interest rates  changes in the legal or regulatory environment in which we operate  press releases  announcements or publicity relating to us or our competitors or relating to trends in our industry  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  including financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts and investors  future sales of our common stock  changes in economic conditions in our marketplace  general conditions in the us economy  financial markets or the banking industry  and other developments affecting our competitors or us 
these factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance  and could prevent you from selling your common stock at or above the price you desire 
in addition  the stock markets  from time to time  experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies 
these broad fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our trading performance 
failure to comply with the restrictions and conditions in the resolutions adopted by our board at the request of our regulators could result in additional enforcement action against us 
on september   the board of directors of the bank adopted a resolution agreeing to higher capital requirements  requirements to reduce the level of our classified and criticized assets and restrictions on dividend payments 
on july   following a joint examination by and discussions with the fdic and the indiana department of financial institutions  the board of directors of the bank adopted a resolution with the same requirements  except for an additional increase in the tier leverage ratio to 
these restrictions may impede our ability to operate our business 
additionally  on december   the board of directors of the company  at the request of the federal reserve bank of chicago  adopted a resolution requiring the board to obtain the approval of the federal reserve bank at least thirty days before taking any of the following actions the payment of corporate dividends  the payment of interest on trust preferred securities  any increase in debt or issuance of trust preferred obligations the request for approval should include a written debt service plan indicating how payments will be made without causing further strain on ameriana bank s capital position  and the redemption of ameriana bancorp stock 
the resolution will remain in effect until the federal reserve bank authorizes the board to rescind the resolution 
if we fail to comply with the terms and conditions of the board resolutions  our regulators could take enforcement action against us  including the imposition of further operating restrictions 
these enforcement actions could take the form of a memorandum of understanding or a cease and desist order 
any informal or formal enforcement action could harm our reputation and our ability to retain or attract customers or employees and impact the trading price of our common stock 
we may require additional capital in the future  but that capital may not be available when it is needed 
we anticipate that we have adequate capital for the foreseeable future 
however  we may at some point need to raise additional capital to support our continued growth or if we incur significant loan or securities impairment 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside our control  and on our financial performance 
accordingly  we cannot assure you of our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  on terms acceptable to us 
if we cannot raise additional capital when needed  our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth could be materially impaired 
provisions of our articles of incorporation  bylaws and indiana law  as well as state and federal banking regulations  could delay or prevent a takeover of us by a third party 
provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and the corporate law of the state of indiana could delay  defer or prevent a third party from acquiring us  despite the possible benefit to our shareholders  or otherwise adversely affect the price of our common stock 
these provisions include supermajority voting requirements for certain business combinations  the election of directors to staggered terms of three years  and advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that shareholders may act on at shareholder meetings 
in addition  we are subject to indiana laws  including one that prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with any interested shareholder for a period of five years from the date the person became an interested shareholder unless certain conditions are met 
these provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts  discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of  and the voting and other rights of the holders of  our common stock 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our board of directors 
we may not be able to realize the full value of our deferred tax asset 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities  coupled with unused tax credits and tax benefits from operating loss carryforwards 
at december   our net deferred tax asset was million 
the net deferred tax asset was composed of approximately million of tax benefit from both state and federal net operating loss carryforwards  approximately million of tax benefit from temporary differences between book and tax income and an unused federal tax credit of million  reduced by a valuation allowance of  we regularly review our deferred tax asset for recoverability based on our history of earnings  expectations for future earnings and expected timing of reversals of temporary differences  as well as tax strategies available to expedite the use of both the deferred state tax asset and the deferred federal tax asset 
realization of our deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient future taxable income 
we currently expect that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax asset at december  will be fully realizable based on our expected future earnings 
realization of our deferred tax asset would significantly improve our earnings and capital through a related reversal of the current valuation allowance

our primary source of income is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on our loan and investment portfolios and the interest expense incurred on our deposits and borrowing portfolios 
our loan portfolio typically earns more interest than the investment portfolio  and our deposits typically have a lower average rate than fhlb advances 
several factors affect our net interest income 
these factors include the loan  investment  deposit  and borrowing portfolio balances  their composition  the length of their maturity  re pricing characteristics  liquidity  credit  and interest rate risk  as well as market and competitive conditions 
financial challenges and expansion in recent years the bank s indianapolis metropolitan market retail expansion strategy was advanced with the opening of two new banking centers in the last quarter of  one in fishers and the second in west carmel 
another banking center located in westfield opened in may of as scheduled  but plans for the construction of a new full service banking center in plainfield on property purchased by the bank in early were put on hold until it is determined that the economy and other conditions warrant the required investment 
the economic climate became progressively difficult through most of  as the world wide financial crisis reached a peak in the second half of the year  and the subsequent economic recovery moved slowly in and through all of the severity of this environment and its consequences to the industry created many new formidable challenges for bankers

non maturity deposits increased million during  of which million represented growth in checking account balances that resulted primarily from the bank s increased focus on sales activities coupled with its banking center expansion strategy 
non brokered certificates of deposit decreased million  mostly a result of bank pricing strategies that were designed to not pursue the retention of the more rate sensitive non core deposits

strategic summary the current economic downturn has created a challenging operating environment for all businesses  and  in particular  the financial services industry 
management continues its focus on maintaining and improving overall credit quality  liquidity and capital 
earnings pressure is expected to continue as the deterioration in credit quality resulting from the weak economy is likely to continue 
competition for deposits continues to be strong  although the low interest rate environment and disciplined pricing has allowed the bank to significantly reduce its cost of deposits while experiencing a lower reduction of yield on interest earning assets  resulting in an improvement in the company s interest rate spread and net interest income 
management is also focused on reducing noninterest expense through aggressive cost control measures including freezing hiring  job restructuring and eliminating certain discretionary expenditures 
achievement of the company s financial objectives will require obtaining new loans and deposits in our traditional markets  generating significant loan and deposit growth from our new offices in hamilton county and continuing the expansion of our commercial lending strategy in the greater indianapolis metropolitan area 
we believe the long term success of the company is dependent on its ability to provide its customers with financial advice and solutions that assist them in achieving their goals 
we will accomplish this mission by being our customer s first choice for financial advice and solutions  informing and educating customers on the basics of money management  and understanding and meeting customer s financial needs throughout their life cycle 
serving customers requires the commitment of all ameriana bank associates to provide exceptional service and sound advice 
we believe these qualities will differentiate us from our competitors and increase profitability and shareholder value 
to meet these long term goals  we have undertaken the following strategies build relationships with our customers 
banking is essentially a transaction business 
nevertheless  numerous industry studies have shown that customers want a relationship with their bank and banker based on trust and sound advice 
based on this information  we are focusing our efforts on building relationships and improving our products per household 
achieve superior customer service 
we continually measure customer satisfaction through post transaction surveys 
our evaluations include telephone and in person customer surveys  as well as other in store performance metrics 
we have enhanced our efforts to improve our service by establishing a training department and formalizing our service standards 
develop and deliver fully integrated financial advice and comprehensive solutions to meet customer life events 
we are re packaging our products around customer life events such as planning for retirement  buying a home and saving for college education rather than traditional transaction accounts  savings and consumer loan products 
establish strong brand awareness 
we believe it is important to create a value proposition that is relevant  understood and valued by our customers 
accordingly  we are continuing our efforts through our marketing  customer communications  training  and design of our banking centers to position ameriana bank as a premier service brand 
use technology to expand our customer base 
we continue to enhance our electronic delivery of products and services to our customers 
our technology based services include business sweep products and cash management services  business remote item capture and on line consumer loan and account opening 
these services will allow us to reach more customers effectively and conveniently 
develop an innovative delivery system 
we believe our banking centers must evolve into financial stores that showcase our financial products and offer our customers an environment that is conducive to interacting with knowledgeable ameriana bank associates and with our technology based products 
increase market share in existing markets and expand into new markets 
we believe there is significant opportunity to increase our products per household with existing customers and attract new customers in our existing and new markets 
further  we believe there are opportunities to gain market share in new markets and have developed an expansion strategy to accomplish this 
as part of our expansion strategy  the company opened three new full service banking centers in hamilton county  which lies just north of marion county and indianapolis 
the new offices in fishers  carmel  and westfield opened in october  december and may  respectively 
in addition  the company purchased a site in plainfield  which will enhance our presence on the west side of indianapolis and our existing office in avon 
plans to begin construction of the plainfield office have been put on hold until it is determined that the economy and other conditions warrant the required investment 
until economic conditions improve  the bank will not continue the strategy of acquiring additional locations for development of full service banking centers to increase our footprint in marion county and surrounding indianapolis metropolitan area and to boost our visibility in this market 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company are maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in detail in the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
the financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions  and such estimates and assumptions are integral to the understanding of reported results 
critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and they require management to make estimates that are difficult  subjective or complex 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses provides coverage for probable losses in the company s loan portfolio 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses each quarter based on changes  if any  in underwriting activities  the loan portfolio composition including product mix and geographic  industry or customer specific concentrations  trends in loan performance  regulatory guidance and economic factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires the use of significant management estimates 
many factors can affect management s estimates of specific and expected losses  including volatility of default probabilities  rating migrations  loss severity and economic and political conditions 
the allowance is increased through provisions charged to operating earnings and reduced by net charge offs 
the company determines the amount of the allowance based on relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
the allowance recorded for commercial loans is based on reviews of individual credit relationships and an analysis of the migration of commercial loans and actual loss experience 
the allowance recorded for noncommercial loans is based on an analysis of loan mix  risk characteristics of the portfolio  fraud loss and bankruptcy experiences and historical losses  adjusted for current trends  for each loan category or group of loans 
the allowance for loan losses relating to impaired loans is based on the loan s observable market price  the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans  or the discounted cash flows using the loan s effective interest rate 
regardless of the extent of the company s analysis of customer performance  portfolio trends or risk management processes  certain inherent but undetected losses are probable within the loan portfolio 
this is due to several factors  including inherent delays in obtaining information regarding a customer s financial condition or changes in their unique business conditions  the subjective nature of individual loan evaluations  collateral assessments and the interpretation of economic trends 
volatility of economic or customer specific conditions affecting the identification and estimation of losses for larger  nonhomogeneous credits and the sensitivity of assumptions utilized to establish allowances for homogenous groups of loans are among other factors 
the company estimates a range of inherent losses related to the existence of these exposures 
the estimates are based upon the company s evaluation of risk associated with the commercial and consumer allowance levels and the estimated impact of the current economic environment 
mortgage servicing rights 
mortgage servicing rights msrs associated with loans originated and sold  where servicing is retained  are capitalized and included in other intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
the value of the capitalized servicing rights represents the present value of the future servicing fees arising from the right to service loans in the portfolio 
critical accounting policies for msrs relate to the initial valuation and subsequent impairment tests 
the methodology used to determine the valuation of msrs requires the development and use of a number of estimates  including anticipated principal amortization and prepayments of that principal balance 
events that may significantly affect the estimates used are changes in interest rates  mortgage loan prepayment speeds and the payment performance of the underlying loans 
the carrying value of the msrs is periodically reviewed for impairment based on a determination of fair value 
impairment  if any  is recognized through a valuation allowance and is recorded as amortization of intangible assets 
valuation measurements 
valuation methodologies often involve a significant degree of judgment  particularly when there are no observable active markets for the items being valued 
investment securities and residential mortgage loans held for sale are carried at fair value  as defined by fasb fair value guidance  which requires key judgments affecting how fair value for such assets and liabilities is determined 
in addition  the outcomes of valuations have a direct bearing on the carrying amounts for goodwill and intangible assets 
to determine the values of these assets and liabilities  as well as the extent to which related assets may be impaired  management makes assumptions and estimates related to discount rates  asset returns  prepayment rates and other factors 
the use of different discount rates or other valuation assumptions could produce significantly different results  which could affect the company s results of operations 
income tax accounting 
we file a consolidated federal income tax return 
the provision for income taxes is based upon income in our consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates on our deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
under us gaap  a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax asset is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning our evaluation of both positive and negative evidence  our forecasts of future income  applicable tax planning strategies  and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions 
positive evidence includes the existence of taxes paid in available carry back years as well as the probability that taxable income will be generated in future periods  while negative evidence includes any cumulative losses in the current year and prior two years and general business and economic trends 
at december  and december   we determined that our existing valuation allowance was adequate  largely based on available tax planning strategies and our projections of future taxable income 
any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to increase the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
any required increase to the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
positions taken in our tax returns may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination 
the benefit of an uncertain tax position is initially recognized in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
such tax positions are both initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not of being realized upon settlement with the tax authority  assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
differences between our position and the position of tax authorities could result in a reduction of a tax benefit or an increase to a tax liability  which could adversely affect our future income tax expense 
we believe our tax policies and practices are critical accounting policies because the determination of our tax provision and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities have a material impact our net income and the carrying value of our assets 
we believe our tax liabilities and assets are adequate and are properly recorded in the consolidated financial statements at december  financial condition total assets decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  primarily due to weak commercial loan demand resulting in a reduction in the bank s loan portfolio  and also due to efforts to reduce the size of the balance sheet to meet regulatory capital requirements 
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million at december  from million at december  cash on hand and in other institutions decreased million  or  to million at december  this change was primarily due to a million decrease in our book balance for the noninterest earning piece of our federal reserve bank account  which represents electronic deposits not yet credited 
interest bearing deposits decreased million  or  to million at december   with the totals for both year end dates consisting predominantly of balances with the federal reserve bank of chicago 
securities investment securities available for sale increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase was due primarily to purchases of mortgage backed securities that exceeded the total for sales of municipal securities  and sales and principal repayments on mortgage backed securities during municipal securities decreased to million through total sales of million that were designed primarily to support the bank s income tax strategies 
mortgage backed securities purchases of million  partially offset by principal repayments and sales  resulted in an increase in the total fair value of ginnie mae and gse mortgage backed pass through securities of million to million at december  all mortgage backed securities at december  are insured by either ginnie mae  fannie mae or freddie mac 
at december   all investments remained classified as available for sale 
all of our investments are evaluated for other than temporary impairment  and such impairment  if any  is recognized as a charge to earnings 
there were no other than temporarily impaired investment securities as of december the following table identifies changes in the investment securities carrying values dollars in thousands change change december ginnie mae and gse mortgage backed pass through securities ginnie mae collateralized mortgage obligations municipal securities mutual funds totals the following table identifies the percentage composition of the investment securities december ginnie mae and gse mortgage backed pass through securities ginnie mae collateralized mortgage obligations municipal securities mutual funds totals see note to the consolidated financial statement for more information on investment securities 
loans net loans receivable totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from million at december  the lack of portfolio growth was due primarily to the impact of the weak economy on commercial loan demand  coupled with management s decision to sell a significant portion of new single family mortgage loans  in addition to a bulk sale of seasoned mortgage portfolio loans  in the secondary market 
residential real estate loans increased million to million at december   from million at december  new production involved a mix of owner occupied single family and investment property loans  as well as a blend of products that included both fixed rate and variable rate pricing 
during  the bank originated million in residential real estate loans  including home equity loans  and sold million into the secondary market 
commercial real estate loans decreased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  commercial loans and leases decreased million to million at december  from million at december  the overall decline in these two categories of commercial loans for was reflective of weak demand related to the impact of economic conditions on the balance sheets of potential borrowers 
commercial real estate and other commercial loans added in totaled million  with million in originations and no purchases 
the bank s construction loans  which consist primarily of commercial properties  decreased million to million during  primarily as a result of a reduced emphasis on this product by the bank that was due mostly to considerations related to the state of the economy 
construction loan originations in totaled million 
on december   the bank had million in loans to local municipalities  compared to million at december  municipal loans are usually added through a competitive bid process 
new municipal loans totaled  for consumer loans declined  to million at december  from million at december  this decrease reflected the impact of the economy on the bank s lending growth objectives 
the bank originated million of consumer loans in new loan volume in totaled million  compared to million in new residential loans  including million of construction loans  decreased to million in from million in commercial loan  commercial real estate  commercial construction and municipal loan additions in totaled million compared to million in new consumer loans totaled million in compared to million in we generally retain loan servicing on loans sold 
loans we serviced for investors  primarily freddie mac  fannie mae and the federal home loan bank of indianapolis  totaled approximately million at december  compared to million at december  the increase was due primarily to sales of refinanced mortgages that resulted from the low interest rate environment for residential mortgages in loans sold that we service generate a steady source of fee income  with servicing fees ranging from to per annum of the loan principal amount 
credit quality nonperforming loans increased million to million at december  from million at december  the increase was primarily due to four credits totaling million that included a million commercial development loan  a million residential condominium construction loan  and two loans totaling million on section low income housing tax credit properties 
we recorded net charge offs of million in  compared to net charge offs of million in total charge offs were million and million in and  respectively 
total recoveries in were  while total recoveries were  in the allowance for loan losses as a percent of loans was at december  and at december  although there was a significant increase in nonperforming loans in the bank s loan portfolio during due primarily to the continuing weak economy  as a result of our review of collateral positions and historic loss ratios  management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover all incurred and probable losses inherent in the portfolio at december  premises and equipment premises and equipment of million at december  represented a  decrease from million at december  the net decrease was a result of million of depreciation exceeding net capital expenditures of  during the period 
stock in federal home loan bank the  decrease in federal home loan bank stock to million at december  was the result of a stock repurchase program initiated by the federal home loan bank in goodwill goodwill of  at december  was unchanged from december   of the goodwill relates to deposits associated with a banking center acquired on february   and  is the result of two separate acquisitions of insurance businesses 
the results of the bank s impairment tests have reflected a fair value for the deposits at this banking center that exceeds the goodwill  and a fair value of the two insurance agency books of business purchased that exceeds the associated goodwill 
cash value of life insurance we have investments in life insurance on employees and directors  with a balance or cash surrender value of million and million  respectively  at december  and the majority of these policies were purchased in some policies with lower returns were exchanged in as part of a restructuring of the program 
the nontaxable increase in cash surrender value of life insurance was  in  compared to  in other real estate owned other real estate owned of million at december   represented an increase of million from december   with properties added and sales during the year 
the increase was due primarily to the second quarter migration of a million commercial real estate credit from the non performing loan classification that represented a retail center and two adjacent lots located in fortville  indiana 
other assets other assets were million at december   compared to million at december  the net reduction of  was primarily the result of a  decrease in prepaid fdic insurance premiums  a  decrease in accrued interest and dividends receivable on loans  investment securities and fhlb stock  and a  decrease in receivables from customers for loan related expenses  offset in part by a  increase in the daily receivable related to the bank s sweep investment product 
deposits the following table shows deposit changes by category dollars in thousands december  change change noninterest bearing deposits savings deposits now deposits money market deposits certificates  and more brokered certificates other certificates totals nonmaturity deposits increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  million of the increase related to checking accounts  noninterest bearing and interest bearing  net of a million decrease in public funds checking balances 
the growth in retail nonmaturity deposits resulted primarily from the bank s increased focus on sales activities coupled with its banking center expansion strategy  and the reaction of individuals to market conditions related to the depressed economic environment 
non brokered certificates of deposit decreased million  due in part to certain customers transferring their funds to non maturity products  but mostly a result of bank strategies that were designed to not pursue the retention of the more rate sensitive non core deposits 
million in brokered certificates of deposit were added in december of  as they were found to be more attractive than other wholesale funding alternatives with regard to cost and collateral considerations 
these certificates have a weighted average original term of months and a weighted average all in cost interest rate plus broker fee of 
million of these certificate accounts have original terms of to months  but the agreements provide the bank with a call option that becomes effective after six months 
borrowings borrowings decreased million to million at december  from million at december   due primarily to the bank s fourth quarter decision to use brokered certificates of deposit as an alternative to new federal home loan bank advances

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses represents the current period credit or cost associated with maintaining an appropriate allowance for loan losses 
periodic fluctuations in the provision for loan losses result from management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is dependent upon many factors  including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies  assessment by management  third parties and banking regulators of the quality of the loan portfolio  the value of the underlying collateral on problem loans and the general economic conditions in our market area 
we believe the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we had a provision for loan losses of million for compared to a provision of million for the provisions for both and reflected the increase in nonperforming loans and elevated level of charge offs  and the increasing pressure of current economic conditions on credit quality 
the allowance to total loans ratio was at december   compared to at december  other income the  increase in total other income to million in  compared to million for  resulted primarily from the net of the following changes a  or  increase in fees and service charges from deposit account relationships  including a  increase in debit card fees  that reflected the bank s success in growing retail checking accounts  a  increase in commissions earned on insurance and brokerage sales that resulted primarily from the july  purchase of a local insurance business  a  increase in gains on sales of loans and servicing rights  due primarily to the second quarter  gain from the million bulk sale of seasoned performing residential mortgage loans  a  decrease in net losses from sales and write downs of oreo and other repossessed assets  from million for to  for  a  increase in oreo income related primarily to additional rental income received on a foreclosed apartment complex which was recently upgraded and strategically marketed  coupled with rental income from a commercial retail property acquired through foreclosure in the second quarter of  reduced in part by an  increase in the loss from a limited partnership investment in real estate qualifying for federal tax credits  from  for to  for  a  gain from the liquidation of a minority interest in family financial  an unconsolidated investment that focused on credit related insurance products that occurred in  and net gains on sales of available for sale securities declining million from million for from million in sales to  for from million in sales 
the sales related mostly to the balance sheet restructuring strategies implemented in the second half of the year 
other expense the company recorded a  decrease in total other expense to million for  compared to million for  due primarily to the following major differences a decrease of  or  in salaries and employee benefits that was due mostly to a  reduction in salaries and payroll taxes  as the benefit from the elimination of positions through attrition exceeded additional salary costs associated with a new banking center and normal annual salary increases for employees 
health insurance costs for decreased by  but the company incurred a  increase in funding costs for the frozen multi employer defined benefit retirement plan 
in light of the impact of poor economic conditions on the earnings of the company  management agreed to forego salary increases for  net occupancy expense for decreased  from  due primarily to a  decrease in real estate taxes that was primarily the result of successful challenges of prior years assessments  in addition to lower tax assessments for the current year 
the decrease in real estate tax expense was offset in part by a  increase in office building rent that was related primarily to a full year of rent for the newest banking center  compared to a partial year of rent expense in  a decrease of  for furniture and equipment expense that resulted from several cost reduction decisions  a decrease of  in legal and professional fees from  for to  for  that was due primarily to a  reduction from  to  in legal fees and professional fees at the holding company  a  decrease in fdic insurance premiums and assessments that was related primarily to the industry wide special assessment that resulted in a  expense in  which was partly offset by higher total net premiums in due to industry wide increases and the exhaustion of the one time credit in  a  decrease in the printing and office supplies expense that resulted primarily from several cost reduction decisions  a  reduction in marketing expense that reflected an expense reduction initiative implemented by bank management in the second half of  and a  reduction in other that resulted primarily from the  expense reversal related to the elimination of a directors post retirement benefit plan  reduced by  in loan expense resulting from the write off of receivables from loan customers that represented advances for taxes and various other items 
the receivables were deemed to be uncollectible based on current information 
the decreases above were offset in part by other real estate owned expense of  for that represented a  increase over the total for  and was related primarily to the larger average size of the portfolio of properties 
the total for included operating expenses on the foreclosed apartment complex and the commercial retail property that together provided  of rental income 
income tax expense we recorded an income tax benefit of  on pre tax income of  for  compared to an income tax benefit of  on a million pre tax loss for both years had a significant amount of tax exempt boli income  and tax exempt income from municipal loans and municipal securities 
we have a deferred state tax asset of million that is primarily the result of operating losses sustained since for state tax purposes 
we started recording a valuation allowance against our current period state income tax benefit in due to our concern that we may not be able to use more than the tax asset already recorded on the books without modifying the use of aimi  our investment subsidiary  which was liquidated effective december  operating income from aimi was not subject to state income taxes under state law  and is the primary reason for the tax asset 
the valuation allowance was  at december  the company had a deferred federal tax asset of million at december   that was composed of million of tax benefit from a net operating loss carryforward of million  million related to temporary differences between book and tax income  and million in tax credits 
the federal loss carryforward expires in  and the tax credits begin to expire in included in the million of tax credits available to offset future federal income tax are approximately  of alternative minimum tax credits which have no expiration date 
management believes that the company will be able to utilize the benefits recorded for loss carryforwards and credits within the allotted time periods 
the bank has initiated several strategies designed to expedite the use of both the deferred state tax asset and the deferred federal tax asset 
through a series of sales of tax exempt municipal securities  that segment of the investment portfolio has already been reduced by million  or  from million at december  to million at december  the proceeds from these sales have been reinvested in taxable financial instruments 
the bank is pursuing a sale leaseback transaction that is expected to result in a material taxable gain on its office properties  and also allow the bank to convert nonearning assets to earnings assets that will produce taxable income 
additionally  the bank is exploring options related to reducing its current investment in tax exempt bank owned life insurance policies  that involve the reinvestment of the proceeds in taxable financial instruments with a similar or greater risk adjusted after tax yield 
sales of banking centers not important to long term growth objectives that would result in taxable gains and reduced operating expenses are also being considered by the bank 
the effective tax rate was in  which resulted from  in pre tax income coupled with a  income tax benefit  compared to an effective tax rate of for that resulted from a million loss before income taxes and a  income tax benefit 
the primary difference in the effective tax rate and the statutory tax rates in both and relates to cash value of life insurance  municipal loans and municipal securities income 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information relating to income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability to meet current and future obligations of a short term nature 
historically  funds provided by operations  loan repayments and new deposits have been our principal sources of liquid funds 
in addition  we have the ability to obtain funds through the sale of new mortgage loans  through borrowings from the fhlb system  and through the brokered certificates market 
we regularly adjust the investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demand  expected deposit flows  yields available on interest earning deposits and securities and the objectives of our asset liability program 
the company is a separate entity and apart from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity 
in addition to its operating expenses  the company is responsible for the payment of dividends declared for its shareholders  and the payment of interest on its subordinated debentures 
at times  the company has repurchased its stock 
substantially all of the company s operating cash is obtained from subsidiary service fees and dividends 
payment of such dividends to the company by the bank is limited under indiana law 
additionally  as part of a resolution adopted by the board of directors of the bank on july   the bank cannot declare or pay any dividends without the prior written consent of the fdic and the indiana department of financial institutions 
see regulatory action 
the company believes that such restriction will not have an impact on the company s ability to meet its ongoing cash obligations 
at december   we had million in loan commitments outstanding and million of additional commitments for line of credit receivables 
certificates of deposit due within one year of december  totaled million  or of total deposits 
if these maturing certificates of deposit do not remain with us  other sources of funds must be used  including other certificates of deposit  brokered cds  and borrowings 
depending on market conditions  we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than currently paid on the certificates of deposit due on or before december  however  based on past experiences we believe that a significant portion of the certificates of deposit will remain 
we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered 
we held million of brokered cds at december   and none at december  our primary investing activities are the origination of loans and purchase of securities 
in  our loan originations totaled million 
we did not purchase any loans from brokers or other financial institutions in financing activities consist primarily of activity in deposit accounts  including brokered certificates of deposit  and fhlb advances 
deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates  the interest rates and products we offer  and our local competitors and other factors 
deposit account balances decreased by  in we had fhlb advances of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements set by the fdic  including a risk based capital measure 
the company is also subject to similar capital requirements set by the federal reserve bank 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories 
at december   both the company and the bank exceeded all of regulatory capital requirements and are considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations  we engage in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  are not recorded on our financial statements 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related data presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
this requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration of changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or at the same rate as changes in the prices of goods and services  which are directly affected by inflation  although interest rates may fluctuate in response to perceived changes in the rate of inflation
