overview of fiscal results during fiscal  we focused on increasing our mix of higher margin services  exiting low margin  non core lines of business and continuing to reduce our selling  administrative and other expenses 
for fiscal  our revenues decreased million  or  from fiscal primarily due to our exit from non core and low margin lines of business in fiscal and from less demand for our it services 
gross margins as a percent of revenue increased basis points from in fiscal to in fiscal due to our focus on higher margin business and exiting low margin lines of business

the overall decline in revenue from services provided directly resulted in a reduction in the number of billable hours and it consultants  which was partially offset by a increase in overall billing rates over the prior year period 
our subsupplier revenue  which is mainly pass through revenue with associated fees  declined by in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of focusing on higher margin business 
with the sale of the assets of our var operations in third quarter of fiscal  hardware and software product sales are no longer a material part of our operations 
cost of services provided directly cost of services provided directly represents our payroll and benefit costs associated with our billable consultants 
this category of expense as a percentage of direct services revenue decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in expense as a percentage of direct revenue is primarily due to the reduction in volume at lower margin staffing accounts 
cost of services provided through subsuppliers cost of services provided through subsuppliers represents our cost when we utilize third parties to fulfill our obligations to our large staffing clients 
this category of expense as a percentage of revenue for services provided through subsuppliers was in fiscal compared to in fiscal cost of product sales cost of product sales represents our cost when we resold hardware and software products 
this category of expense  as a percentage of product sales  was for fiscal with the sale of our var operations in the third quarter of fiscal  hardware and software product sales are no longer a material part of our operations 
selling  administrative and other operating costs sg a costs include management and administrative salaries and benefits  commissions paid to sales representatives and recruiters  location costs and other administrative costs 
this category of costs decreased million from fiscal and represented of total revenue for fiscal compared to for fiscal in fiscal  sg a expenses decreased million as a result of the asset sales  million from the impact of personnel and related cost reductions and million from the implementation of non personnel cost reductions 
restructuring costs and other severance related costs during fiscal  we recorded a net reversal of restructuring costs and other severance related costs of million 
the net reversal is comprised of a million charge relating to severance and severance related expenses and a reversal of million primarily relating to the modification of lease agreements for office space previously vacated 
for fiscal  we recorded workforce reduction charges and office closure and consolidation charges totaling million 
of these charges  million related to severance and other severance related costs and million related to future rent obligations  net of anticipated sub lease income 
impairment of intangible assets during the second quarter of fiscal  we reviewed our client lists in accordance with asc topic  property  plant  and equipment based on the expectation that the business with which the client lists are associated would be sold significantly before the end of their previously estimated useful life 
additionally  in determining fair value  we considered the expected consideration to be received from the sale of the var assets  which implied the client lists were impaired 
based on this measurement  we recorded a million impairment loss  which is the amount by which the carrying value of the client lists exceeded the fair value 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets primarily related to our client lists 
this category of expense decreased during fiscal from the prior year due the sale of all our remaining client lists in third quarter of fiscal non operating income non operating income decreased slightly in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of less interest income earned from our cash balances due to lower interest rates and lower interest income earned related to a client equipment lease 
interest expense we had no borrowing outstanding for fiscal compared to average borrowings of  for fiscal at the end of fiscal  the interest rate was and we incurred interest expense of income taxes for fiscal and  we recorded a provision for income taxes for amounts due for certain state income taxes and changes in our reserves for tax obligations 
we recorded no additional income tax expense or benefit because any tax expense or benefit which would otherwise have been recorded has been negated by adjusting the valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset 
if  however  we successfully return to profitability to a point where future realization of deferred tax assets  which are currently reserved  becomes more likely than not  we may be required to reverse the existing valuation allowance to realize the benefit of these assets 
personnel our it professional staff levels finished fiscal at  a decline from the end of fiscal the decline in it professional staff levels is primarily due to an overall decline in business volume and the sale of assets 
the decline in management and administrative personnel is due to our focus on reducing the number of management and administrative personnel that are necessary to support the existing business operations 
certain information concerning off balance sheet arrangements as of january   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we are  therefore  not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
results of operations for fiscal as compared to fiscal the following table illustrates the relationship between revenue and expense categories and provides a count of employees and technical consultants for fiscal versus fiscal year ended fiscal year ended fiscal increase decrease dollars in thousands amount of revenue amount of revenue amount revenue professional services provided directly professional services provided through subsuppliers product sales total revenue expenses cost of services provided directly cost of services provided through subsuppliers cost of product sales selling  administrative and other operating costs restructuring costs and other severance related costs impairment of intangible assets   nm goodwill impairment amortization of intangible assets total expenses operating loss non operating income interest expense loss before income taxes income tax expense net loss personnel management and administrative consultants nm not material revenue total revenue from services provided directly declined to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decline in revenue was primarily due to a reduction in the number of billable hours as a result of lower business volumes and the sale of the assets of the var operations on august  and mcs operations on september   partially offset by a increase in overall billing rates over the prior fiscal year 
our subsupplier revenue  which is mainly pass through revenue with associated fees  declined by in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the sale of symmetry early in the third quarter of fiscal and due to lower business volumes on the remaining pass through revenues 
product sales declined to million for fiscal from million for fiscal due to the sale of the assets of the var operations and an overall reduction in business volumes 
cost of services provided directly cost of services provided directly represents our payroll and benefit costs associated with our billable consultants 
this category of expense as a percentage of direct services revenue increased to for fiscal from for fiscal due to the impact of client bill rate reductions without offsetting consultant pay rate reductions 
cost of services provided through subsuppliers cost of services provided through subsuppliers represents the cost of third parties to fulfill the obligations to our clients 
this category of expense as a percentage of revenue for services provided through subsuppliers was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease in expense as a percentage of subsupplier revenue was primarily due to the retention of a higher margin client relationship in fiscal versus fiscal cost of product sales cost of product sales represents our cost when we resell technology hardware and software 
this category of expense  as a percentage of product sales  was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease in expense as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the reduction of lower margin commodity hardware sales between the comparable periods 
due to the sale of the assets of the var operations on august   we no longer resell technology hardware and software and  thus  we do not expect to incur this category of costs in the future 
selling  administrative and other operating costs sg a costs include management and administrative salaries  commissions paid to sales representatives and recruiters  location costs  benefits for sg a personnel and other administrative costs 
this category of costs decreased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal sg a expenses decreased primarily due to the impact of personnel reductions  the elimination of costs as a result of the var and mcs asset sales  the implementation of non personnel cost reductions and a reduction in sales and recruiting incentive compensation expense due to the decrease in business volume 
these amounts represent and of total revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
as a percentage of revenue  sg a costs increased due to the lower revenue base in fiscal versus fiscal restructuring costs and other severance related costs for fiscal  we recorded severance and other severance related charges and office closure and consolidation charges totaling million 
of these charges  million related to severance and other severance related costs and million related to future rent obligations  net of anticipated sub lease income 
for fiscal  we recorded severance and other severance related and office closure and consolidation charges totaling million 
of these charges  million related to severance and other severance related costs and million related to future rent obligations  net of anticipated sub lease income 
goodwill impairment in fiscal  we determined that events and changes in circumstances had occurred in our business that would indicate the remaining goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet as of january  was impaired 
our forecast for operating results for future periods had declined and we experienced a significant drop in the price of our publicly traded shares 
as a result of these two events  we determined it was likely that a reduction in fair value of our reporting units had occurred 
given these indicators of potential impairment  we performed an impairment evaluation as of january  which considered these changes in circumstances 
based upon the results of this analysis  we recorded goodwill impairment charges totaling million of our remaining goodwill balance 
impairment of intangible assets during the second quarter of fiscal  we reviewed our client lists in accordance with fasb sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets codified in fasb asc topic  property  plant  and equipment based on the expectation that the business with which the client lists are associated would be sold significantly before the end of their previously estimated useful life 
additionally  in determining fair value  we considered the expected consideration to be received from the sale of the var assets  which implied the client lists were impaired 
based on this measurement  we recorded a million impairment loss  which is the amount by which the carrying value of the client lists exceeded the fair value 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets primarily relates to our client lists 
this category of expense decreased during fiscal compared to fiscal due to the sequoianet 
com trade name and a related client list becoming fully amortized during fiscal  the impairment of intangible assets recorded in fiscal and the sale of the assets of the var operations on august  whereby we disposed of the remaining balance of our client lists intangible asset 
non operating income non operating income decreased slightly in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of less interest income earned from our cash balances due to lower interest rates and lower interest income earned related to a client equipment lease 
interest expense interest expense decreased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal due to a decrease in average borrowings from million for fiscal to  for fiscal offset slightly by an increase in interest rates from at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal to at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal income taxes for fiscal and  we recorded a provision for income taxes for amounts due for certain state income taxes and changes in our reserves for tax obligations 
we recorded no additional income tax expense or benefit because any tax expense or benefit which would otherwise have been recorded has been negated by adjusting the valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset 
if  however  we successfully return to profitability to a point where future realization of deferred tax assets  which are currently reserved  becomes more likely than not  we may be required to reverse the existing valuation allowance to realize the benefit of these assets 
personnel our it professional staff levels finished fiscal at  a decline against the comparable prior period 
the decline in it professional staff levels was due to the sale of assets of our var operations during the third quarter of fiscal and an overall decline in business volume 
the decline in management and administrative personnel was due to our focus on reducing the number of management and administrative personnel that are necessary to support the business operations and due to the sale of the var operations 
the reported it professional staff levels for fiscal exclude mcs  our medical staffing business  due to the separate industry focus of that business 
certain information concerning off balance sheet arrangements as of january   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we are  therefore  not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
liquidity and capital resources the following table provides information relative to the liquidity of our business 
in thousands january  january  increase decrease percentage increase decrease cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable prepaid expenses and other current assets total current assets accounts payable line of credit nm salaries and benefits deferred revenue deferred compensation restructuring accrual other current liabilities total current liabilities working capital current ratio total shareholders equity nm not material change in working capital working capital was million at january   a million reduction from january  the current ratio increased by to at january  compared to at january  our total current assets decreased approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of lower accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets offset slightly by an increase in our cash and cash equivalents 
our accounts receivable decreased due to reduced business volumes and improved collection experience  which lowered our days sales outstanding from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal our prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased as a result of collecting approximately million in contingent consideration during fiscal related to the sale of the var assets in fiscal our total current liabilities decreased approximately million in compared to fiscal as a result of lower accounts payable balances due to reduced business volumes and restructuring accrual payments 
the reduction in the number of personnel at the end of fiscal is primarily responsible for the lower salaries and benefits balance and the deferred compensation balance decreased as a result of payments made in fiscal to previous executives 
we believe our existing working capital and availability under our amended credit facility with wells fargo will be sufficient to support the cash flow needs of our business in fiscal we expect to be able to comply with the requirements of our credit agreement  however  failure to do so could affect our ability to obtain necessary working capital and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
sources and uses of cash credit facility cash and cash equivalents increased by million from january  to january  our primary need for working capital is to support accounts receivable and to fund the time lag between payroll and vendor disbursements and receipt of fees billed to clients 
historically  we have been able to support internal growth in our business with internally generated funds and through the use of our credit facility 
on september   we entered into a credit facility with wells fargo 
on february   we entered into the amended credit facility  which amended the terms of the credit facility and extended the maturity date to september  under the amended credit facility  wells fargo will continue to advance up to million to us for working capital purposes and to facilitate the issuance of letters of credit 
the total amount available for borrowing under the amended credit facility will fluctuate based on our level of eligible accounts receivable 
the amended credit facility carries an interest rate equal to the three month libor rate plus  depending on our operating results 
the credit facility had a one time origination fee of  the balance of which is being amortized over the new term of the amended credit facility 
the annual unused line fee varies between  depending on our operating results  on the daily average unused amount 
the maturity date of the amended credit facility is september  and may be terminated or reduced by us on days notice in exchange for a termination fee of of the maximum line amount or reduction of the maximum line amount through september   thereafter until september   thereafter until september  and no fee in the final year 
borrowings under the amended credit facility are secured by all of our assets 
the amended credit facility requires us to meet certain levels of year to date earnings before taxes 
additionally  the amended credit facility limits our annual capital expenditures to million and contains customary affirmative covenants  including covenants regarding annual  quarterly and projected financial reporting requirements  collateral and insurance maintenance  and compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
further  the facility contains customary negative covenants limiting our ability to grant liens  incur indebtedness  make investments  repurchase our stock  create new subsidiaries  sell assets or engage in any change of control transaction without the consent of wells fargo 
upon an event of default  wells fargo may terminate the facility or declare the entire amount outstanding under the facility to be immediately due and payable and exercise other rights under the agreement 
the events of default under the facility include  among other things  payment defaults  breaches of covenants  a change in control and bankruptcy events 
as of january   we were in compliance with all the requirements and had no borrowing under the credit facility 
total availability under the credit facility  which fluctuates based on our level of eligible accounts receivable  was million as of january  on september  upon consummating the credit facility with wells fargo  we extinguished our previous asset based revolving credit facility 
extinguishment expenses of  relating to the remaining deferred financing costs and transaction related expenses were expensed in the third quarter of fiscal and are included within sg a in the consolidated statements of operations 
on august   we entered into and closed on an asset sale agreement for our var operations 
in consideration for the assets sold  which were primarily client contracts  and the liabilities transferred  we received million in cash at closing and based on the number of client contracts assignments received prior to december   we earned an additional million  which we collected during fiscal  and was recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets for fiscal on september   we entered into and closed on an asset sale agreement for our mcs operations 
in consideration for the assets sold and the liabilities transferred  we received million in cash 
on march   we closed on an asset sale agreement for certain client contracts 
in consideration for the assets sold and the liabilities transferred  we received million in cash 
during fiscal  we made capital expenditures totaling million compared to million in fiscal as of january   we had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
if we are successful in reaching profitability  we expect our federal and state net operating loss carry forwards to offset approximately million of pretax earnings 
contractual obligations we have entered into arrangements that represent certain commitments and have arrangements with certain contingencies 
we lease office facilities under non cancelable operating leases  are engaged in license agreements with future commitments  and have deferred compensation that is payable to participants in accordance with the terms of our restated special executive retirement plan and other agreements 
we incur interest expense on our deferred compensation obligation 
minimum future obligations on operating leases net of sublease contracts  license agreements  and deferred compensation as of january   are as follows in thousands year years years over years total line of credit operating leases maintenance agreements capital lease obligations deferred compensation total critical accounting estimates policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the estimates described below are the most sensitive estimates made by management in the preparation of the financial statements 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties or affect significant line items within our financial statements and potentially result in materially different outcomes under different assumptions and conditions 
application of these policies is particularly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the accounting policies described below meet these characteristics 
allowance for doubtful accounts in each reporting period  we determine the reserve required to address potentially uncollectible accounts 
an evaluation of the risk associated with a client ability to make contractually required payments is used to determine this reserve 
these determinations require considerable judgment in assessing the ultimate potential for collection of these receivables and include reviewing the financial stability of the client  the client ability to pay and current market conditions 
if our evaluation of a client ability to pay is incorrect  we may incur future charges 
restructuring costs and other severance related costs we believe our current estimates regarding severance  other severance related expenses and lease obligations are adequate  however  our inability to sublet the remaining space  negotiate early termination agreements or obtain payments from sub leases could necessitate significant adjustments to these estimates in the future 
revenue recognition policy we generally recognize revenue as services are performed 
this includes it staffing  managed team and project based solutions services that are billed on an hourly basis 
we periodically enter into fixed price engagements 
when we enter into such an engagement  revenue is recognized over the life of the contract based on time and materials input to date and the estimate of time and materials to complete the project 
this method of revenue recognition relies on accurate estimates of the cost  scope  and duration of the engagement 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of the work to be performed  then future revenues may be negatively affected or losses on contracts may need to be recognized 
all future anticipated losses are recognized in the period they are identified 
some of our fixed price engagements include multiple deliverable arrangements which are accounted for utilizing the guidelines of asc topic  multiple element arrangements 
we account for each of the components of multiple deliverable arrangements separately by using the estimated selling price of each component to allocate the total consideration of the arrangement to the separate components 
in certain client situations  where the nature of the engagement requires it  we utilize the services of other companies in our industry 
if these services are provided under an arrangement whereby we agree to retain only a fixed portion of the amount billed to the client to cover our management and administrative costs  we classify the amount billed to the client as subsupplier revenue 
these revenues  however  are recorded on a gross versus net basis because we retain credit risk and are the primary obligor to our client 
all revenue derived from services provided by our employees or other contractors working directly for us are recorded as direct revenue 
income taxes we file a consolidated income tax return in the us federal jurisdiction 
we also file consolidated or separate company income tax returns in most states  canada federal  ontario province and the united kingdom 
as of january   there are no federal  state  and foreign income tax audits in progress 
we are no longer subject to us federal audits for tax years before  and with few exceptions  the same for state and local audits 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize a portion  or all  of our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance 
we adopted the provisions of fasb asc topic on december  asc topic clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise financial statements 
asc topic also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
additionally  asc topic provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within interest and penalties expense 
new accounting pronouncements and interpretations there have been no new accounting pronouncements issued or changes to existing pronouncements during the fiscal year ended january  that would have a material impact on our financial results
