fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales consist almost entirely of retail sales  but also include direct to consumer sales and shipping revenue 
net sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in net sales was attributable to a increase in comparable store sales compared to a decrease in fiscal customer count for fiscal increased and the average ticket decreased

a store is included as comparable at the beginning of the fourteenth full fiscal month of sales

home furnishings were of sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal and consumables were of sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal the company has grown its private label business  particularly in consumables  to compliment the branded gourmet food and wine products and to increase our customer s shopping frequency

table of contents fiscal compared to million in fiscal the company opened two stores in both fiscal and fiscal per store average preopening expense remained relatively flat in fiscal compared to fiscal store preopening expenses vary depending on the amount of time between the possession date and the store opening  the particular store site and whether it is located in a new or existing market

for more information  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
for fiscal  the company expects that the effective tax rate will be consistent with the fiscal effective tax rate 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in net sales was attributable to a decrease in comparable store sales and net sales related to the eight store closures included in continuing operations 
comparable store sales decreased compared to a decrease of in fiscal due primarily to a lower average ticket and a relatively flat customer count 
as of january   the calculation of comparable store sales included a base of stores 
as of january   the company operated stores compared to stores as of january  home furnishings were of sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal and consumables were of sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal during fiscal  the company continued to maximize its consumables business which helped to offset lower sales in some of the higher price home categories  primarily furniture  thereby affecting the overall sales mix between home and consumables 
cost of sales and occupancy cost of sales and occupancy decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  total cost of sales and occupancy decreased basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal cost of sales for fiscal decreased basis points primarily due to the million charge in fiscal related to the permanent write down of selected inventory to current retail value 
excluding the impact of this charge  cost of sales for fiscal decreased basis points 
reductions in the cost of merchandise throughout the year were offset by promotional activity required to compete with aggressive discounting among other specialty retailers  particularly in the furniture category 
additionally  sales in consumables which have a lower margin rate continued to outperform home furnishings putting pressure on the overall margin rate 
occupancy as a percentage of net sales for the year increased basis points as a result of the deleveraging of the costs on lower comparable store sales 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses sg a expenses decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses for fiscal decreased basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in sg a expenses for fiscal was the result of the company s cost cutting initiatives  including store closures  which resulted in lower payroll  advertising and other controllable expenses 
another contributing factor was a decrease in the non cash impairment charge taken in fiscal of million to write down property and equipment at the stores that closed in fiscal as well as other underperforming stores that are not planned to close  compared with the non cash impairment charge of million taken in fiscal additionally  fiscal results include million in costs incurred related to the pier imports inc offer to acquire the company 

table of contents store closure costs costs related to closing the eight stores closed in fiscal classified within continuing operations totaled million for fiscal there were no store closure costs in fiscal relating to closed stores that were classified within continuing operations 
store preopening expenses store preopening expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the company opened two stores in fiscal compared to stores in fiscal per store average preopening expense decreased in fiscal due to lower average occupancy costs incurred prior to the store opening date 
net interest expense net interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal included in net interest expense is interest related to the distribution center lease obligations of million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to both a lower weighted average interest rate and lower borrowings on the company s asset based credit facility 
income taxes the company s effective income tax rate for fiscal was a benefit of  compared to a provision of in fiscal the company recorded a receivable of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal for a carryback claim resulting from the worker  homeownership and business assistance act of which was signed into law on november   and allowed taxpayers to elect to carryback net operating losses for additional periods 
the company s effective tax rate for fiscal reduced for the refund benefit was 
for fiscal  the company reserved against all remaining net deferred tax assets 
for more information  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of fiscal was million compared to million at the end of fiscal the company s primary uses for cash are to provide working capital for operations  to service our obligations  to pay interest and principal on debt  and to fund capital expenditures 
historically  the company has financed its operations primarily from cash generated from operations and seasonal borrowings under an asset based credit facility 
prior to recognizing net income in fiscal  we recognized net losses in each annual period since fiscal as of january   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
for fiscal and fiscal  we did not generate positive cash flows from operating activities 
there can be no assurance that our business will be profitable or will generate sufficient cash to fund operations in the future or that additional losses and negative cash flows from operations will not be incurred  which could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition 
we are dependent upon our asset based credit facility to fund operations and seasonal inventory purchases throughout the year 
access to our asset based credit facility is dependent upon meeting our debt covenants and not exceeding the borrowing limit of the asset based credit facility 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve or sustain positive cash flows from operations or profitability 
if we are unable to maintain adequate liquidity  future operations may need to be scaled back or discontinued 
however  based on our current business plan and revenue projections  we believe that our existing cash balance  our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available asset based credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next months 
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal versus cash used in operating activities of million in fiscal the increase in net cash provided by operations was primarily due to recognizing net income of million in fiscal versus a net loss of million in fiscal and the receipt of a million tax refund in the first quarter of fiscal the increase was partially offset by a moderate increase in inventory levels during the year compared to a large decrease the previous year 

table of contents net cash used in operating activities was million for fiscal versus million in fiscal the increase in net cash used by operations was primarily due to an increase in income taxes receivable compared to a decrease in the prior year  a million charge to permanently write down selected inventory to current retail value in fiscal  as well a smaller change in accounts payable year over year 
the increase in net cash used by operations was largely reduced by a lower net loss in fiscal cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  an increase of million from fiscal in fiscal  there was a minor increase in spending related to information systems  visual merchandise and store projects compared to fiscal net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  a decrease of million from fiscal in fiscal  there was less spending related to information systems  visual merchandise and new store projects compared to fiscal the company estimates that fiscal capital expenditures will approximate million  including approximately million for management information systems and distribution center projects and million for investments in existing stores and various other corporate projects 
cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal the company had outstanding borrowings from its asset based credit facility of million at fiscal year end  which decreased from million at fiscal year end because the company paid down more than it borrowed during the year 
debt issuance cost payments increased by million during fiscal related to the amended and extended secured five year credit agreement the company entered into during the fourth quarter of fiscal  compared to no debt issuance costs paid in the prior year 
principal payments on long term debt related to distribution center obligations were million compared to million in fiscal principal payments on capital lease obligations were million compared to million in fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal the company had outstanding borrowings from its asset based credit facility of million at fiscal year end compared to million at fiscal year end principal payments on long term debt related to distribution center obligations were million for fiscal and fiscal principal payments on capital lease obligations were million compared to million in fiscal revolving lines of credit on january   the company entered into a secured five year credit agreement with a group of banks and bank of america  na as the administrative agent  collateral agent  swing line lender  and letter of credit issuer the credit agreement 
the credit agreement amended and extended the previous million credit agreement dated as of june  which was due to expire on june  the credit agreement allows for cash borrowings under a revolving loan and letters of credit under a secured asset based credit facility of up to million as well as a million term loan which was drawn on the effective date 
the amount available for borrowing at any time is limited by a stated percentage of the aggregate amount of the liquidated value of eligible inventory and the face amount of eligible credit card receivables 
the credit agreement includes three options to increase the size of the asset based credit facility by up to million in the aggregate 
all borrowings and letters of credit under the credit agreement are collateralized by all assets presently owned or hereafter acquired by the company 
interest is paid in arrears monthly  quarterly  or over the applicable interest period as selected by the company in the revolving loan notice  with the entire balance payable on january  borrowings pursuant to the asset based credit facility bear interest  at the company s election  at a rate equal to either i the higher of bank of america s prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus an applicable margin  or ii the libor rate plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin is based on the company s average daily availability as defined in the credit agreement 
in addition  the company pays a commitment fee on the unused portion of the amount available for borrowing as described in the credit agreement 
the credit agreement includes limitations on the ability of the company to  
table of contents among other things  incur debt  grant liens  make investments  enter into mergers and acquisitions  pay dividends  change its business  enter into transactions with affiliates  and dispose of assets 
the events of default under the credit agreement include  among others  payment defaults  cross defaults with certain other indebtedness  breaches of covenants  loss of collateral  judgments  changes in control  and bankruptcy events 
in the event of a default  the credit agreement requires the company to pay incremental interest at the rate of and the lenders may  among other remedies  foreclose on the security which could include the sale of the company s inventory  eliminate their commitments to make credit available  declare due all unpaid principal amounts outstanding  and require cash collateral for any letter of credit obligations 
in addition  in the event of a default or if the company s availability as defined in the credit agreement is not equal to the greater of either million or of the loan cap under the asset based credit facility  the company will be subject to additional restrictions  including specific restrictions with respect to its cash management procedures 
the company intends to use the proceeds from the credit agreement for working capital  issuance of commercial and standby letters of credit  capital expenditures  and other general corporate purposes 
as of january   the company was in compliance with its loan covenant requirements  had million in borrowings including the million term loan and million in outstanding letters of credit  and had credit available under the credit agreement of million 
the company classified its borrowings at the end of fiscal as a current liability because it intends to pay down its asset based credit facility to zero within the next months 
the company s business is highly seasonal  reflecting the general pattern associated with the retail industry of peak sales and earnings during the fourth quarter holiday season  therefore borrowings under the line of credit often peak during the beginning of the fourth quarter 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table provides summary information concerning the company s future contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of january  contractual obligations in millions less than year years years after years total amount committed operating leases capital leases principal and interest long term debt distribution center lease obligations merchandise letters of credit loan outstanding under asset based credit facility standby letters of credit purchase obligations interest total this table excludes million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash payments for these liabilities will occur 
this amount  however  has been recorded as a liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of january  represents outstanding purchase orders  which were primarily related to merchandise inventory 
such purchase orders are generally cancelable at the discretion of the company until the order has been shipped 
the table above excludes certain immaterial executory contracts for goods and services that tend to be recurring in nature and similar in amount year over year 
represents interest expected to be paid on our deferred financing obligations related to the distribution centers 
off balance sheet arrangements other than the operating leases and letters of credit discussed above  the company has no financial arrangements involving special purpose entities or lease agreements  commonly described as synthetic leases  or any off balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect  or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect  on the company s financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 

table of contents impact of new accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance which amends and clarifies accounting standards codification asc  fair value measurements 
this updated guidance requires new disclosures for transfers in and out of level and level and reasons for such transfers  and the separate presentation of purchases  sales  issuances and settlement in the level reconciliation 
it also clarifies guidance around disaggregation and disclosures of inputs and valuation techniques for level and level fair value measurements 
the accounting standard update was effective for reporting periods beginning after december   except for level reconciliation disclosures which are effective for periods beginning after december  the company s adoption of the accounting standard update that was effective for reporting periods beginning after december  did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
the company does not expect the adoption of the accounting standard update related to the level reconciliation disclosures to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its financial condition and results of operations during the past three fiscal years 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 

table of contents quarterly results and seasonality the following tables set forth the company s unaudited quarterly operating results for the eight most recent quarterly periods fiscal quarters ended in thousands  except per share data and number of stores may  july  october  january  net sales gross profit net income loss from continuing operations net loss from discontinued operations net income loss net income loss per weighted average share from continuing operations basic diluted net loss per weighted average share from discontinued operations basic diluted net income loss per weighted average share basic diluted number of stores open at end of period fiscal quarters ended in thousands  except per share data and number of stores may  august  october  january  net sales gross profit net income loss from continuing operations net income loss from discontinued operations net income loss net income loss per weighted average share from continuing operations basic diluted net income loss per weighted average share from discontinued operations basic diluted net income loss per weighted average share basic diluted number of stores open at end of period the company s business is highly seasonal  reflecting the general pattern associated with the retail industry of peak sales and earnings during the fourth quarter holiday season 
due to the importance of the holiday selling season  the fourth quarter of each fiscal year has historically contributed  and the company expects it will continue to contribute  a disproportionate percentage of the company s net sales and most of its net income  if any  for the entire fiscal year 
any factors negatively affecting the company during the holiday selling season in any year  including unfavorable economic conditions  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company generally experiences lower sales and earnings 
table of contents during the first three quarters and  as is typical in the retail industry  may incur losses in these quarters 
the results of operations for these interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full fiscal year 
in addition  the company makes decisions regarding merchandise well in advance of the season in which it will be sold 
significant deviations from projected demand for products could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations  either by lost gross sales due to insufficient inventory or lost gross margin due to the need to mark down excess inventory 
the company s quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate based upon such factors as delays in the flow of merchandise  the ability to realize the expected operational and cost efficiencies from its distribution centers  the number and timing of store openings and related store preopening expenses  the amount of net sales contributed by new and existing stores  the mix of products sold  the timing and level of markdowns  store closings or relocations  competitive factors  changes in fuel and other shipping costs  general economic conditions  geopolitical conditions  fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies  labor market fluctuations  changes in accounting rules and regulations and unseasonable weather conditions 
critical accounting policies and estimates cost plus  inc s and its subsidiaries discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  inventory values  fixed asset lives  intangible asset values  deferred income taxes  self insurance reserves and the impact of contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company has also chosen certain accounting policies when options are available  including the retail inventory method of accounting for inventories 
operating results would be affected if other alternatives were used 
although not all inclusive  the company believes that the following represent the more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from the sale of merchandise either at the point of sale in its stores or at the time of receipt by the customer for merchandise purchased from its website 
revenue from sales of gift cards is deferred until redemption or until the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote gift card breakage 
income from gift card breakage is recorded as a reduction to selling  general and administrative expenses 
shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized as revenue at the time the merchandise is delivered to the customer 
the company s revenues are reported net of discounts and returns  including an allowance for estimated returns 
the allowance for sales returns is based on historical experience and was approximately million at the end of fiscal and million at the end of fiscal and fiscal revenues are presented net of any taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the retail inventory method rim  in which the valuation of inventories at cost and gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
rim is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
the company s use of the rim results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market as markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  merchandise markup  markdowns and shrinkage  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as gross margin 
physical inventories are conducted annually during the second fiscal quarter to 
table of contents calculate actual shrinkage and inventory on hand 
estimates are used to charge inventory shrinkage for the remaining quarters of the fiscal year 
consideration is given to a number of quantitative factors  including anticipated subsequent markdowns and aging of inventories 
to the extent that actual markdowns are higher or lower than estimated  the company s gross margins could increase or decrease and  accordingly  affect its financial position and results of operations 
a significant variation between the estimated provision and actual results could have a substantial impact on the company s results of operations 
management does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood of a material change in the assumed factors used to create the estimates the company uses to calculate its ending inventory under rim 
the company s rim utilizes multiple departments in which fairly homogeneous classes of merchandise inventories having similar gross margins are grouped 
management believes that the company s rim provides an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
inventory costs also include certain buying and distribution costs related to the procurement  processing and transportation of merchandise 
self insured liabilities the company is primarily self insured for workers compensation  employee health benefits and general liability claims 
the company determines self insurance liabilities based on claims filed  including the development of those claims  and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
factors affecting this estimate include future inflation rates  changes in severity  benefit level changes  medical costs and claim settlement patterns 
should a different amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated  or costs of the claims increase or decrease beyond what was anticipated  reserves may need to be adjusted accordingly 
other accounting estimates estimates inherent in the preparation of the company s financial statements include those associated with the evaluation of the recoverability of deferred tax assets  the adequacy of tax contingencies  the impairment of goodwill and long lived assets and those estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to litigation  claims and assessments 
the company assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and records a valuation allowance  if necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and recent financial operations 
in fiscal year  the company established a valuation allowance of million against its deferred tax assets 
in fiscal years  and  the valuation allowance was increased by million  million and million  respectively 
this is a non cash charge that management felt was appropriate to record due to the cumulative losses in recent years and the store closure activities met the prescribed criteria for taking an allowance 
the company s effective tax rate may be materially impacted by changes in the estimated level of earnings and changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance 
the company recognizes tax positions when they are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement 
the company is subject to periodic audits by the internal revenue service and state and local taxing authorities 
these audits may challenge certain of the company s tax positions such as the timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of taxable income to various tax jurisdictions 
the company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes 
these tax uncertainties are reviewed as facts and circumstances change and are adjusted accordingly 
this requires significant management judgment in estimating final outcomes 
actual results could materially differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the company s effective tax rate and cash flows in future years 
section of the internal revenue service code section imposes limitations on a corporation s ability to utilize its net operating losses nol if it experiences an ownership change 
in general terms  an ownership change results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain existing stockholders and  or  new stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than percentage points during a three year testing period 
any unused nol resulting from an annual limitation may be carried over to later years  and the amount 
table of contents of the limitation may  under certain circumstances  be increased to reflect both recognized and deemed recognized built in gains that occur during the sixty month period after the ownership change 
based on our analysis to date  we believe we have undergone an ownership change  which may affect the timing of our ability to utilize our nol 
however  the resulting limitation does not affect the company s ability to utilize its nol for the fiscal year ended january   and we do not expect the limitation to affect the fiscal year which will end on january  the company reviews long lived assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable 
using its best estimates based on reasonable assumptions and projections  the company records an impairment loss to write such assets down to their estimated fair values if the carrying values of the assets exceed their related undiscounted expected future cash flows 
store specific long lived assets and intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated along with the stores in their respective media market  which is the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified 
corporate assets or other long lived assets that are not store specific are evaluated at a consolidated entity level 
based on the impairment tests performed  there was no impairment of long lived and intangible assets with finite lives in fiscal however  the company recorded a  non cash impairment charge in fiscal to write down property and equipment at the four underperforming stores that closed during the first quarter of fiscal as they had reached the end of their lease terms 
the company records the estimated future liability for any store closures where a lease obligation still exists  associated with the rental obligation on the date the store is closed and the liability for the costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized when the liability is incurred 
during fiscal  the company expects to record a pre tax charge of approximately million related to the store closures consisting primarily of lease exit costs 
the company is involved in litigation  claims and assessments incidental to its business  the disposition of which is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company s assumptions related to these matters 
the company s policy is to accrue its best estimate of the probable cost for the resolution of claims 
when appropriate  such estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel handling the matters and are based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
to the extent additional information arises or the company s strategies change  it is possible that the company s best estimate of its probable liability may change 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks  which include changes in us interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the company does not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk the interest payable on the company s bank line of credit is based on a variable interest rate and therefore is affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates on existing variable rate debt were to rise basis points a change from the company s borrowing rate as of january   the company s results of operations and cash flows would not be materially affected 
in the event of a default on the company s asset based credit facility  the company would be required to pay incremental interest at a rate of on the outstanding loan balance 
foreign currency risks approximately of purchase obligations outside of the united states of america into which the company enters are settled in us dollars  therefore  the company has only minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risks 
the cost of products purchased in international markets can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and significant exchange rate changes could have a material impact on future product costs 
the extent to which an increase in costs from foreign currency exchange rate changes will be able to be recovered in higher prices charged to customers is uncertain 
the company does not currently hedge against foreign currency risks
