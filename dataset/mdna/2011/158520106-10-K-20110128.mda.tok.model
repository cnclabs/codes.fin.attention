item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a commercial printer  business forms manufacturer and office products and office furniture supplier in regional markets of the united states of america  east of the mississippi river 
the company also publishes the herald dispatch daily newspaper in huntington  west virginia with a total daily and sunday circulation of approximately  and  respectively 
the company has grown through strategic acquisitions and internal growth 
through such growth  the company has realized regional economies of scale  operational efficiencies  and exposure of its core products to new markets 
the company has acquired fifteen printing companies  eight office products and office furniture companies  one company with a combined emphasis on both printing and office products and office furniture  a paper distribution division which was subsequently sold in and a daily newspaper since its initial public offering on january  the company net revenues consist primarily of sales of commercial printing  business forms  tags  other printed products  document output solutions including rendering  inserting and mailing  office supplies  office furniture  data products and office design services as well as newspaper revenues primarily from advertising and circulation 
the company recognizes revenues when products are shipped or ownership is transferred and when services are rendered to the customer 
newspaper advertising revenues are recognized  net of agency commissions  in the period when advertising is printed or placed on web sites 
circulation revenues are recognized when purchased newspapers are distributed 
the company revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations caused by variations in demand for its products 
the company cost of sales primarily consists of raw materials  including paper  ink  pre press supplies and purchased office supplies  furniture and data products  and manufacturing costs including direct labor  indirect labor and overhead 
significant factors affecting the company cost of sales include the costs of paper in printing  office supplies and the newspaper operations  costs of labor and other raw materials 
the company operating costs consist of selling  general and administrative expenses 
these costs include salaries  commissions and wages for sales  customer service  accounting  administrative and executive personnel  rent  utilities  legal  audit  information systems equipment costs  software maintenance and depreciation 
critical accounting policies involving significant estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the discussion and analysis of the financial statements and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the following critical accounting policies affect the company s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
restatement of prior year in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company identified approximately million  or per share on a basic and diluted basis  of non cash deferred tax related adjustments for accordingly  the consolidated financial statements for october  presented in this form k have been restated to increase deferred income tax expense and to increase deferred income tax liability 
this adjustment is related to the goodwill  tradename and masthead associated with the acquisition of the herald dispatch 
this deferred tax liability will remain on the balance sheet until such time as the associated intangible assets are impaired  sold or otherwise disposed of 
as a result of the impairment charge recorded in this deferred tax liability is now reflected as a deferred tax asset due to the non cash benefit associated with the impairment of goodwill  tradename and masthead 
asset impairment the company is required to test for asset impairment relating to property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
the company performs an impairment analysis when indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators are present  an analysis of the sum of the future expected cash flows from the company s asset  undiscounted and without interest charges is calculated 
if it is less than the carrying value  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the impairment is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying value of the asset 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires management to make assumptions about future cash flows over future years and that the impact of recognizing impairment could have a significant effect on operations 
management s assumptions about future cash flows require significant judgment because actual operating levels have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
management has discussed the development and selection of this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to it in this management  discussion and analysis md a 
in accordance with gaap  a two step impairment test is performed on goodwill 
in the first step  a comparison is made of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value  the second step of the impairment test is required 
in the second step  an estimate of the current fair values of all assets and liabilities is made to determine the amount of implied goodwill and consequently the amount of any goodwill impairment 
in connection with our annual impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets conducted in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of million million  net of deferred tax benefit for impairment of the value of the goodwill and other intangible assets  which resulted from the acquisition of the herald dispatch daily newspaper in huntington  wv 
this charge resulted in impairment charges of trademark and masthead of million  subscriber base asset of million  advertiser base asset million and goodwill million 
the associated deferred tax benefit of these charges approximated million 
there were no impairment charges as a result of our annual impairment testing in the company determined that it should perform impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets during the fourth quarter of  due  in part  to declines in our stock price  increased volatility in operating results and declines in market transactions in the industry 
the valuation methodology utilized to estimate the fair value of the newspaper operating segment was based on both the market and income approach 
the company then undertook the next step in the impairment testing process by determining the fair value of assets and liabilities within this reporting unit 
the implied fair values of goodwill and other intangibles for this reporting unit was less than the carrying amount by million million net of deferred tax benefit based on the analysis by the company and with assistance of third party valuation specialists  and therefore an impairment charge in this amount was taken 
the goodwill and other intangible assets will continue to be amortized for tax purposes over its remaining life in accordance with applicable internal revenue service standards 
management has discussed the development of these estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
additionally  the board of directors has reviewed this disclosure and its relation to this md a 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when products are shipped or ownership is transferred and when services are rendered to customers 
the company acts as a principal party in sales transactions  assumes title to products and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership including risk of loss for collection  delivery or returns 
the company typically recognizes revenue for the majority of its products upon shipment to the customer and transfer of title 
under agreements with certain customers  custom forms may be stored by the company for future delivery 
in these situations  the company may receive a logistics and warehouse management fee for the services provided 
in these cases  delivery and bill schedules are outlined with the customer and product revenue is recognized when manufacturing is complete and the product is received into the warehouse  title transfers to the customer  the order is invoiced and there is reasonable assurance of collectability 
since the majority of products are customized  product returns are not significant 
therefore  the company records sales on a gross basis 
advertising revenues are recognized  net of agency commissions  in the period when advertising is printed or placed on websites 
circulation revenues are recognized when purchased newspapers are distributed 
amounts received from customers in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue 
the deferred revenue associated with the herald dispatch approximated  and  at october  and revenue generally is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to government authorities 
the costs of delivering finished goods to customers are recorded as shipping and handling costs and included in cost of sales 
shipping and handling costs that are included in the price of the product are included in net sales 
income taxes provisions for income taxes currently payable and deferred income taxes are based on the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company encounters risks associated with sales and the collection of the associated accounts receivable 
as such  the company records a monthly provision for accounts receivable that are considered to be uncollectible 
in order to calculate the appropriate monthly provision  the company primarily utilizes a historical rate of accounts receivables written off as a percentage of total revenue 
this historical rate is applied to the current revenues on a monthly basis 
the historical rate is updated periodically based on events that may change the rate  such as a significant increase or decrease in collection performance and timing of payments as well as the calculated total exposure in relation to the allowance 
periodically  the company compares the identified credit risks with the allowance that has been established using historical experience and adjusts the allowance accordingly 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change from period to period and could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement and working capital 
management has discussed the development and selection of this estimate with the audit committee of the board of directors  and the board has  in turn  reviewed the disclosure and its relation to this md a 
during  and    and  of bad debt expense was incurred and the allowance for doubtful accounts was   and  of october   and the actual write offs for the periods were   and  during  and general economic conditions and specific geographic and customer concerns are major factors that may affect the adequacy of the allowance and may result in a change in the annual bad debt expense 
the following discussion and analysis presents the significant changes in the financial position and results of operations of the company and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated information derived from the company consolidated statements of operations  including certain information presented as a percentage of total revenues

this change represents a decrease in revenues of approximately million  or 
printing revenues decreased by million or from million in to million in office products and office furniture revenue decreased million or from million in to million in the decrease in revenues for the office products and office furniture segment was primarily attributable to lower sales in both office products and office furniture

this change represented a decrease of million  or  in cost of sales 
printing cost of sales decreased million to million in compared to million in printing cost of sales as a percentage of printing sales decreased to as a percent of printing sales in from in this decrease was primarily the result of improved labor absorption and lower material costs as a percent of sales  partially offset by higher overhead absorption costs 
office products and office furniture cost of sales decreased million to million in from million in the decrease in office products and office furniture cost of sales is attributable to a decrease in office products and office furniture sales

this charge resulted in impairment charges of trademark and masthead of million  subscriber base asset of million  advertiser base asset of million and goodwill of million  the associated deferred tax benefit of these charges approximated million 
there were no impairment charges as a result of our annual impairment testing in the valuation methodology utilized to estimate the fair value of the newspaper operating segment was based on both the market and income approach 
the income approach was based on a discounted cash flow methodology  in which expected future free net cash flows to invested capital are discounted to present value  using an appropriate after tax weighted average cost of capital 
the market approach using a guideline company analysis weighs empirical evidence from shares of comparable companies sold in minority transactions on stock exchanges and merger and acquisition analysis  which analyses sales of newspapers in control transactions 
the company then undertook the next step in the impairment testing process by determining the fair value of assets and liabilities within this reporting unit 
the implied fair values of goodwill and other intangibles for this reporting unit was less than the carrying amount by million million net of deferred tax benefit  and therefore an impairment charge in this amount was taken

inflation and economic conditions management believes that the effect of inflation on the company operations has not been material and will continue to be immaterial for the foreseeable future 
the company does not have long term contracts  therefore  to the extent permitted by competition  it has the ability to pass through to its customers most cost increases resulting from inflation  if any 
in addition  the company is not particularly energy dependent  therefore  an increase in energy costs should not have a significant impact on the company 
seasonality our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations that we expect to continue to be reflected in our operating results in future periods 
historically  the company has experienced a greater portion of its profitability in the second and fourth quarters than in the first and third quarters 
the second quarter generally reflects increased orders for printing of corporate annual reports and proxy statements 
a post labor day increase in demand for printing services and office products coincides with the company fourth quarter 
on a historical basis the herald dispatch first and third calendar quarters of the year tended to be the weakest because advertising volume is at its lowest levels following the holiday season and a seasonal slowdown in the summer months 
correspondingly  on a historical basis the fourth calendar quarter followed by the second calendar quarter tended to be the strongest quarters 
the fourth calendar quarter includes heavy holiday season advertising 
other factors that affect our quarterly revenues and operating results may be beyond our control  including changes in the pricing policies of our competitors  the hiring and retention of key personnel  wage and cost pressures  distribution costs  changes in newsprint prices and general economic factors 
our operating results depend on the relative strength of the economy on both a regional and national basis 
recessionary conditions applicable to the economy as a whole and specifically to our core business segments  have had a significant adverse impact on the company business 
a continuing or a deepening of the recessionary conditions we are experiencing could significantly affect our revenue categories 
newly issued accounting standards in october  the fasb issued asu  which amends the criteria in asc  revenue recognition  for revenue recognition in multiple deliverable arrangements 
the amendments established a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence is available 
this update is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   and may be applied on either prospective basis  with early adoption permitted 
the company will adopt asu effective for fiscal year the adoption of this standard is not anticipated to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not have any significant exposure relating to market risk 
market risk is generally defined as loss risk exposure from financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates  foreign currency rates and commodity prices 
as of october   the company did not hold or utilize derivative financial instruments to manage market risk that could expose the company to other market risk 
the debt the company holds is variable rate debt and therefore the interest expense would fluctuate based on interest rate volatility
