the discussion of results that follows includes comparisons to non gaap financial measures 
these non gaap measures exclude the net loss on airgas transaction in and for  the non gaap measures exclude the global cost reduction plan charge  costs related to customer bankruptcy and asset actions  and third quarter pension settlement costs 
the presentation of non gaap measures is intended to enhance the usefulness of financial information by providing measures that our management uses internally to evaluate our baseline performance on a comparable basis 
the reconciliation of reported gaap results to non gaap measures is presented on pages business overview air products and chemicals  inc and its subsidiaries serves energy  electronics  chemicals  steel  and manufacturing customers globally with a unique portfolio of products  services  and solutions that include atmospheric gases  process and specialty gases  performance materials  equipment  and services 
geographically diverse  with operations in over countries  we have sales of billion  assets of billion  and a worldwide workforce of approximately  employees 
we organize our operations into four reportable business segments merchant gases  tonnage gases  electronics and performance materials  and equipment and energy 
in summary in  we had strong increases in sales and earnings in the first half of the year with a slowing in the second half due to product supply and cost issues and declining economic growth 
in the first two quarters of  underlying sales increased and  respectively due to strong volume growth 
in the third and fourth quarters of  our underlying sales increased and  respectively 
overall for  sales increased  principally due to volume increases of 
volumes increased in the electronics and performance materials and tonnage gases segments 
also  we achieved significant growth in asia in the merchant gases segment 
operating income increased due primarily to improved performance in the electronics and performance materials and tonnage gases segments 
operating margin increased modestly from last year  as operating leverage was partially offset by a number of product supply and cost issues in the last nine months of the year

table of contents outlook with the significant degree of uncertainty around the global economy  we are prepared for a wide range of economic developments 
management believes global economic growth in the regions we operate in could range from in we expect that the us will have positive growth between 
europe should range between a negative to a positive 
we believe asia will continue as the strongest region  growing at 
regardless of global economic conditions  we expect new plant onstreams to increase earnings in loading existing assets would also benefit earnings  however  this factor will be most influenced by the economy 
we also expect earnings improvement from our productivity efforts and cost controls in discretionary spending  new programs  and staffing 
these gains will be partially offset by higher pension expense next year  as a result of a decline in the discount rates and lower asset returns  lower equipment and energy results  and a higher tax rate in the tax rate is expected to be approximately excluding the impact of the completion of the tax examination and any changes in uncertain tax positions related to the two spanish tax matters  as described in note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements 
outlook by segment in merchant gases  we expect volume growth in the us from new applications and the expansion of microbulk small bulk offerings 
as we continue to expand our capacity in asia  manufacturing growth along with new applications should lead to stronger volumes 
in europe  we will continue to seek higher pricing to offset higher energy costs and will also take actions to reduce operating costs 
tonnage gases is expected to benefit from the full year loading of our new plant start ups  along with several investments due to come onstream in in electronics  we expect the second half of the year to be stronger than the first half  primarily due to new plant start ups and increased demand 
the electronics equipment business is expected to slow in due to a forecasted decline in electronics industry capital spending 
for performance materials  we anticipate typical seasonality in the first quarter and that volumes will remain soft in the first half of the year 
however  if economic conditions improve as expected in the second half of the year  volume growth should return  as we benefit from our low cost production facilities and new product  market and application successes 
equipment and energy results are expected to decline due to lower lng activity

the remainder of this charge   was for business exits and asset management actions

we had  of long term debt subject to variable interest rates at september  excluding fixed rate debt that has been swapped to variable rate debt 
the rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at september variable interest rates are primarily determined by interbank offer rates and by us short term tax exempt interest rates 
leases refer to note  leases  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital and operating leases 
pension obligations the amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by us that in total equal the recognized pension liabilities 
the amount represents the low end of an estimated range of to refer to note  retirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements 
these payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment 
the total accrued liability for pension benefits is impacted by interest rates  plan demographics  actual return on plan assets  continuation or modification of benefits  and other factors 
such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions 
unconditional purchase obligations most of our long term unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous hyco hydrogen  carbon monoxide  and syngas facilities 
the price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas 
however  long term take or pay sales contracts to hyco customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply 
due to the matching of most long term feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts  we do not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
refer to note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
the unconditional purchase obligations also include other product supply and purchase commitments and electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations  which are primarily pass through contracts with our customers 
we also have one supply agreement that is not matched to a customer sales contract that has terms extending to ten years and the related commitment is at prices that are not in excess of current market prices 
in addition  purchase commitments to spend approximately for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in 
table of contents we also purchase materials  energy  capital equipment  supplies  and services as part of the ordinary course of business under arrangements that are not unconditional purchase obligations 
the majority of such purchases are for raw materials and energy  which are obtained under requirements type contracts at market prices 
in total  we purchase approximately billion annually  including the unconditional purchase obligations in the table above 
other liabilities in june  we entered into agreements obligating us to purchase of the remaining shares of cryoservice limited csl 
the agreements require the consideration  which is based on a multiple of earnings formula  to be remitted in december at september  the liability amounted to and has been reported in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet

income tax liabilities noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities as of september were refer to note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of september were these tax liabilities were not included in the contractual obligations table  as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year 
pension benefits we and certain of our subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover a substantial portion of our worldwide employees 
the principal defined benefit pension plans the us salaried pension plan and the uk pension plan were closed to new participants in and were replaced with defined contribution plans 
over the long run  the shift to defined contribution plans is expected to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions

actuarial gains losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses 
future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets  different from expected returns  would impact the actuarial gains losses and resulting amortization in years beyond 
table of contents pension funding pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans 
with respect to funded plans  our funding policy is that contributions  combined with appreciation and earnings  will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses 
in addition  we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions 
we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan  which help guide the level of contributions 
during and  our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were and  respectively 
the majority of the cash contributions were voluntary 
cash contributions to defined benefit plans  including benefit payments for unfunded plans  are estimated to be approximately to in actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation  discount rates  investment performance  plan design  and various other factors 
refer to the contractual obligations discussion on page for a projection of future contributions 
environmental matters we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we have operations 
compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs 
from time to time  we are involved in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act the federal superfund law  similar state laws  and the resource conservation and recovery act rcra relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation and possible cleanup 
our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in note  major accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements  and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
the amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled   and in   and  respectively 
these amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws  remedial activities  and activities undertaken to meet internal company standards 
future costs are not expected to be materially different from these amounts 
the amount included a charge of for the paulsboro site 
refer to note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on this charge 
although precise amounts are difficult to determine  we estimate that in both and  we spent approximately and  respectively  on capital projects to control pollution 
capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated to be approximately and in and  respectively 
we accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
the potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from to a reasonably possible upper exposure of the consolidated balance sheets at september and included an accrual of and  respectively 
the accrual for the environmental obligations relating to the pace  florida  piedmont  south carolina  and the paulsboro  new jersey locations is included in these amounts 
refer to note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these facilities 
actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates  given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures 
subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs  we do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a materially adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations in any one year 
some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have  or are developing  regulations governing emissions of greenhouse gases ghg 
these include existing and expanding coverage under the european union emissions trading scheme  mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in alberta  canada  and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on ghg emissions in ontario  canada and south korea 
in addition  the us environmental protection agency is regulating ghg emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities 
at the us state level  california s cap and trade program rules have been officially adopted and our compliance obligation as a hydrogen producer is set to begin january we believe we will be able to mitigate some of the costs through our contractual terms 

table of contents increased public awareness and concern may result in more international  us federal  and or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg 
although uncertain  these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power  hydrogen production  and fluorinated gases production 
we believe we will be able to mitigate some of the potential costs through our contractual terms  but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements in some of the jurisdictions where we operate prevents accurate prediction of the long term impact on us 
any legislation that limits or taxes ghg emissions from our facilities could impact our growth by increasing our operating costs or reducing demand for certain of our products 
regulation of ghg may also produce new opportunities for us 
we continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption  improve efficiency  and lower emissions 
we are also developing a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from power and chemical plants before it reaches the atmosphere  enable cleaner transportation fuels  and facilitate alternate fuel source development 
in addition  the potential demand for clean coal and our carbon capture solutions could increase demand for oxygen  one of our main products  and our proprietary technology for delivering low cost oxygen 
off balance sheet arrangements we have entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
we are not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity 
we do not have any derivative instruments indexed to our own stock 
our off balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition  changes in financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
related party transactions our principal related parties are equity affiliates operating primarily in the industrial gas business 
we did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated at arm s length with clearly independent parties 
inflation the consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with us gaap and do not fully reflect the impact of prior years inflation 
while some inflationary pressures developed during the second half of fiscal year  inflation in the us has been modest for several years 
in addition  we operate in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates  with inflationary pressures that differ from those in the us the ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations 
it is estimated that the cost of replacing our plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost 
accordingly  depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis 
critical accounting policies and estimates note  major accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements describes our major accounting policies 
judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas 
however  application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires management s significant judgments  often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee 
depreciable lives of plant and equipment net plant and equipment at september totaled  and depreciation expense totaled during plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight line method  which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life 
economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us  which may be less than its physical life 
assumptions on the following factors  among others  affect the determination of estimated economic useful life wear and tear  obsolescence  technical standards  contract life  market demand  competitive position  raw material availability  and geographic location 
the estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness  especially in light of changed business circumstances 
for example  changes in technology  changes in the estimated future demand for products  or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated 
in these cases  we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life  thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 
likewise  if the estimated useful life is increased  the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 

table of contents we have numerous long term customer supply contracts  particularly in the gases on site business within the tonnage gases segment 
these contracts principally have initial contract terms of to years 
there are also long term customer supply contracts associated with the tonnage gases business within the electronics and performance materials segment 
these contracts principally have initial terms of to years 
additionally  we have several customer supply contracts within the energy and equipment segment with contract terms that are primarily to years 
the depreciable lives of assets within this segment can be extended to years for certain re deployable assets 
depreciable lives of the production assets related to long term contracts are matched to the contract lives 
extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term 
as contract terms are extended  the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term  as long as it does not exceed the economic life of the asset 
the depreciable lives of production facilities within the merchant gases segment are principally years 
customer contracts associated with products produced at these types of facilities typically have a much shorter term 
the depreciable lives of production facilities within the electronics and performance materials segment  where there is not an associated long term supply agreement  range from to years 
these depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances  potential obsolescence  competitors actions  etc 
management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change 
a change in the depreciable life by one year for production facilities within the merchant gases and electronics and performance materials segments for which there is not an associated long term customer supply agreement would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below decrease life by year increase life by year merchant gases electronics and performance materials impairment of long lived assets plant and equipment plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows 
impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a long lived asset grouping  a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition  a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping  or changes in the expected useful life of the long lived assets 
there were no such events or changes in circumstances that occurred during the reporting periods 
if such circumstances are determined to exist  an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists 
if an asset group is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group s fair value and its carrying value 
an estimate of the asset group s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows 
assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
the assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent management s best estimates at the time of the impairment review 
factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions  sales volume and prices  costs to produce  inflation  etc 
changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge 
we use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges 
goodwill the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations currently requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets of an acquired entity 
goodwill  including goodwill associated with equity affiliates of  was as of september the majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within the merchant gases and electronics and performance materials segments 
disclosures related to goodwill are included in note  goodwill and intangible assets  to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents we perform an impairment test annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
in addition  goodwill would be tested more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicated that potential impairment exists 
the impairment test requires that we compare the fair value of business reporting units to carrying value  including assigned goodwill 
we have designated our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing as one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly 
currently  we have four business segments and fifteen reporting units 
reporting units are primarily based on products and geographic locations within each business segment 
in the fourth quarter of  we conducted the required annual test of goodwill for impairment 
we determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value  and therefore there were no indications of impairment 
we primarily use an income approach valuation model  representing the present value of future cash flows  to determine fair value of a reporting unit 
our valuation model uses a five year growth period for the business and an estimated exit trading multiple 
management has determined the income approach valuation model represents the most appropriate valuation methodology due to the capital intensive nature of the business  long term contractual nature of the business  relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units  and limited comparables within the industry 
the principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rate  operating profit margins  discount rate  and exit multiple 
revenue growth rate and operating profit assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and long term financial planning process 
the discount rate assumption is calculated based upon an estimated weighted average cost of capital which includes factors such as the risk free rate of return  cost of debt  and expected equity premiums 
the exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions 
also  the expected cash flows consider the customer attrition rate assumption  which is based on historical experience and current and future expected market conditions 
management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model  and actual results could differ from the estimates 
intangible assets intangible assets at september totaled and consisted primarily of customer relationships as well as purchased patents and technology 
we have no intangible assets with indefinite lives 
intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the long lived asset grouping impairment tests 
impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
see impairment discussion above under plant and equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined 
equity investments investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled  at september the majority of our investments are non publicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business 
summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in note  summarized financial information of equity affiliates  to the consolidated financial statements 
equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable 
in the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs  and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary  an impairment loss would be recognized 
management s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee 
changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using the enacted tax rate 
at september  accrued income taxes and net deferred tax liabilities amounted to and  respectively 
tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of september were  excluding interest and penalties 
income tax expense was for the year ended september disclosures related to income taxes are included in note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements 
management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and the related balance sheet amounts 
judgments are required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets 

table of contents actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates  depending upon changes in income tax laws  actual results of operations  and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities 
tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed 
we believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for the probable outcome of these assessments 
deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
however  when there are not sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards  these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance 
a valuation allowance is recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits 
the effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the current period tax expense 
a point increase decrease in our effective tax rate would have decreased increased net income by approximately pension benefits the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension benefits under the defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions 
the discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans 
actuarial models are used in calculating the pension expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans 
these models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis  therefore  the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern 
several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans 
we determine assumptions about the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets  and the rate of compensation increase 
note  retirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weighted average basis for both the domestic and international plans 
the actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age  mortality  and turnover rates 
we believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable 
however  actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement  mortality  and turnover 
one of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate 
this rate reflects the prevailing market rate for high quality  fixed income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected duration of the benefit obligations on the annual measurement date for each of the various plans 
the rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date 
the timing and amount of expected benefit cash flows are matched against the returns of high quality corporate bonds over the expected benefit payment period to determine an overall effective discount rate 
this rate will change from year to year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields 
a higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense 
a bp increase decrease in the discount rate decreases increases pension expense by approximately per year 
the expected rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of return to be earned by plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid 
the expected return on plan assets assumption is based on a weighted average of estimated long term returns of major asset classes and the historical performance of plan assets 
in determining asset class returns  we take into account historical long term returns  and the value of active management  as well as the interest rate environment 
asset allocation is determined based on long term return  volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes  the profiles of the plans liabilities and acceptable levels of risk 
lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense 
a bp increase decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreases increases pension expense by approximately per year 
we use a market related valuation method for recognizing investment gains or losses 
investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market related value of assets 
this method recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur  which reduces year to year volatility 
expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market related value of assets over the five year period 

table of contents the expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption 
we determine this rate based on review of the underlying long term salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience  as well as comparison to peer companies 
a bp increase decrease in the expected rate of compensation increases decreases pension expense by approximately per year 
loss contingencies in the normal course of business we encounter contingencies  ie  situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on us 
we accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
when only a range of possible loss can be established  the most probable amount in the range is accrued 
if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range  the minimum amount in the range is accrued 
contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters for which our accounting policy is discussed in note  major accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements  and particulars are provided in note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
significant judgment is required in both determining probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated 
these determinations are made based on the best available information at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies 
revisions in the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted 
for example  due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures  a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated  the scope of remediation is increased  or our proportionate share is increased 
similarly  a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings  cash flows  and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
it is our policy to minimize our cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital 
we mitigate adverse energy price impacts through our cost pass through contracts with customers and price increases 
in the past  we have also entered into a limited number of commodity swap contracts in order to reduce the cash flow exposure to changes in the price of natural gas relative to certain oil based feedstocks 
there were no commodity swap contracts outstanding at september and we address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions  thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes 
for details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and the major accounting policies  see note  major accounting policies  and note  financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements  for additional information 
our derivative and other financial instruments consist of long term debt including current portion  interest rate swaps  cross currency interest rate swaps  foreign exchange forward contracts  and foreign exchange option contracts 
the net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position 
the net financial instrument position at september does not include available for sale securities of  as disclosed in note  fair value measurements  to the consolidated financial statements 
the available for sale securities in primarily included the investment in airgas stock of  which was subsequently sold in at september and  the net financial instrument position was a liability of  and  respectively 
the increase in the net financial instrument position was due primarily to the impact of a higher book value of long term debt excluding exchange rate impacts 
the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices 
market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen 
the market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a third party software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions interest rates  spot and forward exchange rates  and implied volatilities as of the valuation date 
interest rate risk our debt portfolio  including swap agreements  as of september primarily comprised debt denominated in us dollars and euros  including the effect of currency swaps 
this debt portfolio is composed of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt 
changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable rate portions of our debt portfolio 
a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position 
the sensitivity analysis related to the fixed portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous bp move in interest rates from the level at september  with all other variables held constant 
a bp increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of and in the net liability position of financial instruments at september and  respectively 
a bp decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of and in the net liability position of financial instruments at september and  respectively 
based on the variable rate debt included in our debt portfolio  including the interest rate swap agreements  a bp increase in interest rates would result in an additional and of interest incurred per year at the end of september and  respectively 
a bp decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by and per year at september and  respectively 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at september and  with all other variables held constant 
a strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase  respectively  of and in the net liability position of financial instruments at september and  respectively 

table of contents the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the euro and the us dollar versus the pound sterling 
foreign currency debt  cross currency interest rate swaps  and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business  thereby reducing our net asset exposure 
foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows  along with foreign exchange option contracts 
thus  there is either an asset liability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal or more favorable in the case of purchased foreign exchange option contracts to the impact on the instruments in the analysis
