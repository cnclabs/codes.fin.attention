execution of the plan to transition our client base onto the nextgen platform is under execution 
the practice solutions division provides technology solutions and consulting services to cover the full spectrum of providers revenue cycle needs from patient access through claims denials 
practice solutions division revenue growth in fiscal years  and was positively impacted by the acquisitions of hsi and pmp in may and october  respectively 
growth subsequent to fiscal year was created primarily by cross selling rcm services to nextgen clients 
on may   we acquired st 
louis based hsi  a full service healthcare rcm company

a full service healthcare rcm company 
similar to hsi  pmp operates under the umbrella of the company s practice solutions division 
founded in  pmp provides physician billing and technology management services to healthcare providers  primarily in the mid atlantic region 
inpatient solutions division 
the inpatient solutions division  with its primary location in austin  texas  provides integrated clinical  financial and connectivity solutions for rural and community hospitals 
on august   we acquired nextgen is  a provider of financial information systems to the small hospital inpatient market 
this acquisition  along with our acquisition of opus  is part of our strategy to expand into the small hospital market and to add new clients by taking advantage of cross selling opportunities between the ambulatory and inpatient markets 

table of contents on february   we acquired opus  a provider of clinical information systems to the small hospital inpatient market 
founded in and headquartered in austin  texas  opus delivers web based clinical solutions to hospital systems and integrated health networks nationwide 
this acquisition complements and will be integrated with the assets and operations of nextgen is 
both companies are established developers of software and services for the inpatient market and will operate under the company s inpatient solutions division 
the inpatient solutions division products that deliver secure  highly adaptable and easy to use applications to patient centered hospitals and health systems consist of nextgen clinicals  which resides on an advanced truly active web platform and is designed to initiate widespread work efficiency and communication  reduce errors and time to chart  and improve care  and nextgen financials  which is a financial and administrative system that helps hospitals significantly improve the smart operations and financial and regulatory management of their facilities 
industry background the turbulence in the worldwide economy has impacted almost all industries 
while healthcare is not immune to economic cycles  we believe it is more resilient than most segments of the economy 
the impact of the current economic conditions on our existing and prospective clients has been mixed 
we continue to see organizations that are doing fairly well operationally  however  some organizations with a large dependency on medicaid populations are being impacted by the challenging financial condition of the many state governments in whose jurisdictions they conduct business 
a positive factor for us healthcare is the fact that the obama administration is pursuing broad healthcare reform aimed at improving issues surrounding healthcare 
the american recovery and reinvestment act arra  which became law on february   includes more than billion to help healthcare organizations modernize operations through the acquisition of health care information technology 
the certification commission for health information technology cchit  a non profit organization recognized by the office of the national coordinator for health information technology as an approved authorized testing and certification body  announced that our ehr solution was certified as a complete ehr and compliant during the quarter ended september   which comes off the heels of the stage meaningful use definition criteria under the arra that was announced in july with the lifting of the many meaningful use definition uncertainties  which has impacted software revenue  we believe we are well positioned to aid physicians and hospitals with their ehr decisions as they prepare to make incentive based purchases 
moreover  to compete in the continually changing healthcare environment  providers are increasingly using technology to help maximize the efficiency of their business practices  to assist in enhancing patient care  and to maintain the privacy of patient information 
as the reimbursement environment continues to evolve  more healthcare providers enter into contracts  often with multiple entities  which define the terms under which care is administered and paid 
the diversity of payor organizations  as well as additional government regulation and changes in reimbursement models  have greatly increased the complexity of pricing  billing  reimbursement and records management for medical and dental practices 
to operate effectively  healthcare provider organizations must efficiently manage patient care and other information and workflow processes  which increasingly extend across multiple locations  disparate systems  and business entities 
in response  healthcare provider organizations have placed increasing demands on their information systems 
initially  these information systems automated financial and administrative functions 
as it became necessary to manage patient flow processes  the need arose to integrate back office data with such clinical information as patient test results and office visits 
we believe information systems must facilitate management of patient information incorporating administrative  financial and clinical information from multiple entities 
in addition  large healthcare organizations increasingly require information systems that can deliver high performance in environments with multiple concurrent computer users 
many existing healthcare information systems were designed for limited administrative tasks such as billing and scheduling and can neither accommodate multiple computing environments nor operate effectively across multiple locations and entities 
we believe that practices that leverage technology to more efficiently handle patient clinical data as well as administrative  financial and other practice management data will be best able to enhance patient flow  pursue cost efficiencies and improve quality of care 
as healthcare organizations transition to new computer platforms and newer technologies  we believe such organizations will be migrating toward the implementation of enterprise wide  patient centric computing systems embedded with automated clinical patient records 
our strategy our strategy is  at present  to focus on providing software and services to physician practices  dental practices  hospitals  health centers  other healthcare providers and to expand service offerings to include the payor market and consumer market segments 
among the key elements of this strategy are continue development and enhancement of select software solutions in target markets  continue investments in our infrastructure including  but not limited to  sales  marketing  implementation  consulting and support  continue investment in product development  which includes developing a new integrated inpatient and outpatient  web based software platform  continue efforts to make infrastructure investments within an overall context of maintaining reasonable expense discipline  
table of contents addition of new clients through maintaining and expanding sales  marketing and product development activities  expand our relationship with existing clients through delivery of innovative new and complementary products and services  and continue our gold standard commitment of service in support of our client satisfaction programs 
while these are the key elements of our current strategy  there can be no guarantee that our strategy will not change  or that we will succeed in achieving these goals individually or collectively

electronic data interchange 
we make available edi capabilities and connectivity services to our clients 
the edi connectivity capabilities encompass direct interfaces between our products and external third party systems  as well as transaction based services 
edi products are intended to automate a number of manual  often paper based or telephony intensive communications between patients and or providers and or payors 
two of the more common edi services are forwarding insurance claims electronically from providers to payers and assisting practices with issuing statements to patients 
most client practices utilize at least some of these services from us or one of our competitors 
other edi connectivity services are used more sporadically by client practices 
we typically compete to displace incumbent vendors for claims and statements accounts and attempt to increase usage of other elements in our edi connectivity product line 
in general  edi services are only sold to those accounts utilizing software from either the qsi dental or nextgen divisions 
services include electronic claims submission through our relationships with a number of payors and national claims clearinghouses  electronic patient statement processing  appointment reminder cards and calls  recall cards  patient letters and other correspondence  electronic insurance eligibility verification  and electronic posting of remittances from insurance carriers into the accounts receivable application

table of contents sales and marketing we sell and market our products nationwide primarily through a direct sales force 
the efforts of the direct sales force are augmented by a small number of reseller relationships established by us 
software license sales to resellers represented less than of total revenue for the years ended march   and our direct sales force typically makes presentations to potential clients by demonstrating the system and our capabilities on the prospective client s premises 
sales efforts aimed at smaller practices can be performed on the prospective clients premises  or remotely via telephone or internet based presentations

clients have the option to purchase maintenance services which  if purchased  are invoiced on a monthly  quarterly or annual basis 
several clients have purchased our practice management software and  in turn  are providing either time share or billing services to single and group practice practitioners 
under the time share or billing service agreements  the client provides the use of our software for a fee to one or more practitioners 
although we typically do not receive a fee directly from the distributor s clients  implementation of such arrangements has  from time to time  resulted in the purchase of additional software capacity by the distributor  as well as new software purchases made by the distributor s customers should such customers decide to perform the practice management functions in house 
we continue to concentrate our direct sales and marketing efforts on medical and dental practices  networks of such practices including msos and phos  professional schools  community health centers and other ambulatory care settings 
msos  phos and similar networks to which we have sold systems provide use of our software to those group and single physician practices associated with the organization or hospital on either a service basis or by directing us to contract with those practices for the sale of stand alone systems

from time to time we assist prospective clients in identifying third party sources for financing the purchase of our systems 
the financing is typically obtained by the client directly from institutional lenders and typically takes the form of a loan from the institution secured by the system to be purchased or a leasing arrangement 
we do not guarantee the financing nor retain any continuing interest in the transaction 
we have numerous clients and do not believe that the loss of any single client would adversely affect us 
no client accounted for or more of our net revenue during the fiscal years ended march   or client service and support we believe our success is attributable in part to our client service and support departments

competition the markets for healthcare information systems and services are intensely competitive 
the industry is highly fragmented and includes numerous competitors  none of which we believe dominates these markets 
our principal existing competitors in the healthcare information systems and services market include eclinicalworks  ge healthcare ge  allscripts healthcare solutions  inc allscripts  epic  mckesson and other competitors 
our recent entry into the small hospital market has introduced new competitors  including computer programs and systems  inc  healthland and healthcare management systems  inc 
the electronic patient records and connectivity markets  in particular  are subject to rapid changes in technology  and we expect that competition in these market segments will increase as new competitors enter the market 
we believe our principal competitive advantages are the features and capabilities of our products and services  our high level of client support and our extensive experience in the industry 
the revenue cycle management market is also intensely competitive as other healthcare information systems companies  such as ge  mckesson and allscripts  are also in the market of selling both practice management and electronic health records software and medical billing and collection services 
product enhancement and development the healthcare information management and computer software and hardware industries are characterized by rapid technological change requiring us to engage in continuing investments to update  enhance and improve our systems 
during fiscal years  and  we expended approximately million  million and million  respectively  on research and development activities  including capitalized software amounts of million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  a portion of our product enhancements have resulted from software development work performed under contracts with our clients 
other information employees as of march   we employed approximately  persons  of which  were full time employees 
we believe that our future success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining qualified sales  marketing and technical personnel as well as other employees 
intellectual property to protect our intellectual property  we enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees with whom such controls are relevant 
certain qualified employees enter into additional agreements that permit them access under certain circumstances  to software matters that are both confidential and more strictly controlled

risk factors the more prominent risks and uncertainties inherent in our business are described below 
however  additional risks and uncertainties may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations will likely suffer 
any of these or other factors could harm our business and future results of operations and may cause you to lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business the effects of the recent global economic crisis may impact our business  operating results or financial condition 
the recent global economic crisis has caused a general tightening in the credit markets  lower levels of liquidity  increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy and extreme volatility in credit  equity and fixed income markets 
these macroeconomic developments could negatively affect our business  operating results or financial condition in a number of ways 
for example  current or potential clients may be unable to fund software purchases  which could cause them to delay  decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or to not pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services 
our clients may cease business operations or conduct business on a greatly reduced basis 
finally  our investment portfolio is generally subject to general credit  liquidity  counterparty  market and interest rate risks that may be exacerbated by the recent global financial crisis 
if the banking system or the fixed income  credit or equity markets continue to deteriorate or remain volatile  our investment portfolio may be impacted and the values and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected as well 
we face significant  evolving competition which  if we fail to properly address  could adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and price of our stock 
the markets for healthcare information systems are intensely competitive  and we face significant competition from a number of different sources 
several of our competitors have significantly greater name recognition as well as substantially greater financial  technical  product development and marketing resources than we do 
there has been significant merger and acquisition activity among a number of our competitors in recent years 
transaction induced pressures  or other related factors may result in price erosion or other negative market dynamics that could adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and price of our stock 
we compete in all of our markets with other major healthcare related companies  information management companies  systems integrators and other software developers 
competitive pressures and other factors  such as new product introductions by us or our competitors  may result in price or market share erosion that could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
also  there can be no assurance that our applications will achieve broad market acceptance or will successfully compete with other available software products 
our inability to make initial sales of our systems to newly formed groups and or healthcare providers that are replacing or substantially modifying their healthcare information systems could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if new systems sales do not materialize  our near term and longer term revenue will be adversely affected 
many of our competitors have greater resources than we do 
in order to compete successfully  we must keep pace with our competitors in anticipating and responding to the rapid changes involving the industry in which we operate  or our business  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
the software market generally is characterized by rapid technological change  changing client needs  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards 
the introduction of products incorporating new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing and marketing new products that respond to technological changes or evolving industry standards 
new product development depends upon significant research and development expenditures which depend ultimately upon sales growth 
any material shortfall in revenue or research funding could impair our ability to respond to technological advances or opportunities in the marketplace and to remain competitive 
if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or client requirements  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
in response to increasing market demand  we are currently developing new generations of targeted software products 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop these new software products or that these products will operate successfully  or that any such development  even if successful  will be completed concurrently with or prior to introduction of competing products 
any such failure or delay could adversely affect our competitive position or could make our current products obsolete 
we face risk and or the possibility of claims from activities related to strategic partners  which could be expensive and time consuming  divert personnel and other resources from our business and result in adverse publicity that could harm our business 
we rely on third parties to provide services that affect our business 
for example  we use national clearinghouses in the processing of some insurance claims and we outsource some of our hardware maintenance services and the printing and delivery of patient statements for our clients 
these third parties could raise their prices and or be acquired by competitors of ours  which could potentially create short and long term disruptions to our business negatively impacting our revenue  profit and or stock price 
we also have relationships with certain third parties where these third parties serve as sales channels through which we generate a portion of our revenue 
due to these third party relationships  we could be subject to claims as a result of the activities  products  or services of these third party service providers even though we were not directly involved in the circumstances leading to those claims 
even if these claims do not result in liability to us  defending and investigating these claims could be expensive and time consuming  divert personnel and other resources from our business and result in adverse publicity that could harm our business 

table of contents we may engage in future acquisitions  which may be expensive and time consuming and from which we may not realize anticipated benefits 
we may acquire additional businesses  technologies and products if we determine that these additional businesses  technologies and products are likely to serve our strategic goals 
during fiscal year  we acquired hsi and pmp  both of which are full service healthcare rcm companies servicing physician groups and other healthcare clients 
during fiscal year  we acquired opus and nextgen is  both of which are developers of software and services for the inpatient market 
the specific risks we may encounter in these types of transactions include but are not limited to the following potentially dilutive issuances of our securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition  use of cash as acquisition currency may adversely affect interest or investment income  thereby potentially adversely affecting our earnings and or earnings per share  difficulty in fully or effectively integrating any acquired technologies or software products into our current products and technologies  where we may not receive the intended benefits of an acquisition  difficulty in predicting and responding to issues related to product transition such as development  distribution and client support  the possible adverse effect of such acquisitions on existing relationships with third party partners and suppliers of technologies and services  the possibility that staff or clients of the acquired company might not accept new ownership and may transition to different technologies or attempt to renegotiate contract terms or relationships  including maintenance or support agreements  the possibility that the due diligence process in any such acquisition may not completely identify material issues associated with product quality  product architecture  product development  intellectual property issues  key personnel issues or legal and financial contingencies  including any deficiencies in internal controls and procedures and the costs associated with remedying such deficiencies  difficulty in entering geographic and business markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  difficulty in integrating acquired operations due to geographical distance and language and cultural differences  and the possibility that acquired assets become impaired  requiring us to take a charge to earnings which could be significant 
a failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses or technology for any of these reasons could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our failure to manage growth could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have in the past experienced periods of growth which have placed  and may continue to place  a significant strain on our non cash resources 
we also anticipate expanding our overall software development  marketing  sales  client management and training capacity 
in the event we are unable to identify  hire  train and retain qualified individuals in such capacities within a reasonable timeframe  such failure could have an adverse effect on us 
in addition  our ability to manage future increases  if any  in the scope of our operations or personnel will depend on significant expansion of our research and development  marketing and sales  management and administrative and financial capabilities 
the failure of our management to effectively manage expansion in our business could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our operations are dependent upon our key personnel 
if such personnel were to leave unexpectedly  we may not be able to execute our business plan 
our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel  many of whom have been with us for a significant period of time 
these personnel have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to our business 
we maintain key man life insurance on only one of our employees 
because we have a relatively small number of employees when compared to other leading companies in our industry  our dependence on maintaining our relationships with key employees is particularly significant 
we are also dependent on our ability to attract high quality personnel  particularly in the areas of sales and applications development 
the industry in which we operate is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting of skilled personnel 
there can be no assurance that our current employees will continue to work for us 
loss of services of key employees could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  we may need to grant additional equity incentives to key employees and provide other forms of incentive compensation to attract and retain such key personnel 
equity incentives may be dilutive to our per share financial performance 
failure to provide such types of incentive compensation could jeopardize our recruitment and retention capabilities 
continuing worldwide political and economic uncertainties may adversely affect our revenue and profitability 
the last several years have been periodically marked by concerns including but not limited to inflation  decreased consumer confidence  the lingering effects of international conflicts  energy costs and terrorist and military activities 
these conditions can make it extremely difficult for our clients  our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities  and they could cause constrained spending on our products and services and or delay and lengthen sales cycles 
we are implementing a new company wide enterprise resource planning erp system 
the implementation process is complex and involves a number of risks that may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we are currently replacing our multiple legacy business systems at different sites with a new company wide  integrated erp system to handle various business  operating and financial processes 
the new system will enhance a variety of important functions  such as order entry  invoicing  accounts receivable  accounts payable  financial consolidation  and internal and external financial and management reporting matters 

table of contents erp implementations are complex and time consuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on system hardware and software and implementation activities that often continue for several years 
such an integrated  wide scale implementation is extremely complex and requires transformation of business and financial processes in order to reap the benefits of the erp system 
significant efforts are required for requirements identification  functional design  process documentation  data conversion  user training and post implementation support 
problems in any of these areas could result in operational issues including delayed billing and accounting errors and other operational issues 
system delays or malfunctioning could also disrupt our ability to timely and accurately process and report results of our operations  financial position and cash flows  which could impact our ability to timely complete important business processes such as the evaluation of its internal controls and attestation activities pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of until the new erp system is fully implemented  we expect to incur additional selling  general and administrative expenses and capital expenditures to implement and test the system  and there can be no assurance that other issues relating to the erp system will not occur or be identified 
our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if it experiences operating problems and or cost overruns during the erp implementation process or if the erp system and the associated process changes  do not function as expected or give rise to the expected benefits 
we own a captive facility  located in india and we are subject to regulatory  economic  social and political uncertainties in india 
we are subject to several risks associated with having a portion of our assets and operations located in india 
many us companies have benefited from many policies of the government of india and the indian state governments in the states in which we operate  which are designed to promote foreign investment generally and the business process services industry in particular  including significant tax incentives  relaxation of regulatory restrictions  liberalized import and export duties and preferential rules on foreign investment and repatriation 
there is no assurance that such policies will continue 
various factors  such as changes in the current federal government  could trigger significant changes in india s economic liberalization and deregulation policies and disrupt business and economic conditions in india generally and our business in particular 
in addition  our financial performance and the market price of our common shares may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and economic and fiscal policy in india  including changes in exchange rates and controls  interest rates and taxation policies  as well as social stability and political  economic or diplomatic developments affecting india in the future 
in particular  india has experienced significant economic growth over the last several years  but faces major challenges in sustaining that growth in the years ahead 
these challenges include the need for substantial infrastructure development and improving access to healthcare and education 
our ability to recruit  train and retain qualified employees  develop and operate our captive facility could be adversely affected if india does not successfully meet these challenges 
risks related to our products and service if our principal products and our new product development fail to meet the needs of our clients  we may fail to realize future growth 
we currently derive substantially all of our net revenue from sales of our healthcare information systems and related services 
we believe that a primary factor in the market acceptance of our systems has been our ability to meet the needs of users of healthcare information systems 
our future financial performance will depend in large part on our ability to continue to meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients through the timely development and successful introduction and implementation of new and enhanced versions of our systems and other complementary products 
we have historically expended a significant percentage of our net revenue on product development and believe that significant continuing product development efforts will be required to sustain our growth 
continued investment in our sales staff and our client implementation and support staffs will also be required to support future growth 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our product development efforts  that the market will continue to accept our existing products  or that new products or product enhancements will be developed and implemented in a timely manner  meet the requirements of healthcare providers  or achieve market acceptance 
if new products or product enhancements do not achieve market acceptance  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
at certain times in the past  we have also experienced delays in purchases of our products by clients anticipating our launch  or the launch of our competitors  of new products 
there can be no assurance that material order deferrals in anticipation of new product introductions from ourselves or other entities will not occur 
if the emerging technologies and platforms of microsoft and others upon which we build our products do not gain or continue to maintain broad market acceptance  or if we fail to develop and introduce in a timely manner new products and services compatible with such emerging technologies  we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenue will suffer 
our software products are built and depend upon several underlying and evolving relational database management system platforms such as those developed by microsoft 
to date  the standards and technologies upon which we have chosen to develop our products have proven to have gained industry acceptance 
however  the market for our software products is subject to ongoing rapid technological developments  quickly evolving industry standards and rapid changes in client requirements  and there may be existing or future technologies and platforms that achieve industry standard status  which are not compatible with our products 
we face the possibility of subscription pricing  which may force us to adjust our sales  marketing and pricing strategies 
in april  we announced a new subscription based software as a service delivery model which includes monthly subscription pricing 
this model is designed for smaller practices to quickly access the nextgen ehr or nextgen pm products at a modest monthly per provider price 
we currently derive substantially all of our systems revenue from traditional software license  implementation and training fees  as well as the resale of computer hardware 
today  the majority of our clients pay an initial license fee for the use of our products  in addition to a periodic maintenance fee 
while the intent of the new subscription based delivery model is to further penetrate the smaller practice market  there can be no assurance that this delivery model will not become increasingly popular with both small and large clients 
if the marketplace increasingly demands subscription pricing  we may be forced to further adjust our sales  marketing and pricing strategies accordingly  by offering a higher percentage of our 
table of contents products and services through these means 
shifting to a significantly greater degree of subscription pricing could adversely affect our financial condition  cash flows and quarterly and annual revenue and results of operations  as our revenue would initially decrease substantially 
there can be no assurance that the marketplace will not increasingly embrace subscription pricing 
we face the possibility of claims based upon our web site content  which may cause us expense and management distraction 
we could be subject to third party claims based on the nature and content of information supplied on our web site by us or third parties  including content providers or users 
we could also be subject to liability for content that may be accessible through our web site or third party web sites linked from our web site or through content and information that may be posted by users in chat rooms  bulletin boards or on web sites created by professionals using our applications 
even if these claims do not result in liability to us  investigating and defending against these claims could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention away from our operations 
if our security measures are breached or fail and unauthorized access is obtained to a client s data  our services may be perceived as not being secure  clients may curtail or stop using our services  and we may incur significant liabilities 
our services involve the storage and transmission of clients proprietary information and protected health information of patients 
because of the sensitivity of this information  security features of our software are very important 
if our security measures are breached or fail as a result of third party action  employee error  malfeasance  insufficiency  defective design  or otherwise  someone may be able to obtain unauthorized access to client or patient data 
as a result  our reputation could be damaged  our business may suffer  and we could face damages for contract breach  penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations and significant costs for remediation and remediation efforts to prevent future occurrences 
we rely upon our clients as users of our system for key activities to promote security of the system and the data within it  such as administration of client side access credentialing and control of client side display of data 
on occasion  our clients have failed to perform these activities 
failure of clients to perform these activities may result in claims against us that this reliance was misplaced  which could expose us to significant expense and harm to our reputation 
because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures 
if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs  the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and clients 
in addition  our clients may authorize or enable third parties to access their client data or the data of their patients on our systems 
because we do not control such access  we cannot ensure the complete propriety of that access or integrity or security of such data in our systems 
failure by our clients to obtain proper permissions and waivers may result in claims against us or may limit or prevent our use of data  which could harm our business 
we require our clients to provide necessary notices and to obtain necessary permissions and waivers for use and disclosure of the information that we receive  and we require contractual assurances from them that they have done so and will do so 
if they do not obtain necessary permissions and waivers  then our use and disclosure of information that we receive from them or on their behalf may be limited or prohibited by state or federal privacy laws or other laws 
this could impair our functions  processes and databases that reflect  contain  or are based upon such data and may prevent use of such data 
in addition  this could interfere with or prevent creation or use of rules and analyses or limit other data driven activities that benefit us 
moreover  we may be subject to claims or liability for use or disclosure of information by reason of lack of valid notice  permission or waiver 
these claims or liabilities could subject us to unexpected costs and adversely affect our operating results 
we face the possibility of damages resulting from internal and external security breaches and viruses 
in the course of our business operations  we compile and transmit confidential information  including patient health information  in our processing centers and other facilities 
a breach of security in any of these facilities could damage our reputation and result in damages being assessed against us 
in addition  the other systems with which we may interface  such as the internet and related systems may be vulnerable to security breaches  viruses  programming errors  or similar disruptive problems 
the effect of these security breaches and related issues could disrupt our ability to perform certain key business functions and could potentially reduce demand for our services 
accordingly  we have expended significant resources toward establishing and enhancing the security of our related infrastructures  although no assurance can be given that they will be entirely free from potential breach 
maintaining and enhancing our infrastructure security may require us to expend significant capital in the future 
the success of our strategy to offer our edi services and internet solutions depends on the confidence of our clients in our ability to securely transmit confidential information 
our edi services and internet solutions rely on encryption  authentication and other security technology licensed from third parties to achieve secure transmission of confidential information 
we may not be able to stop unauthorized attempts to gain access to or disrupt the transmission of communications by our clients 
anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate confidential user information or interrupt our  or our clients  operations 
in addition  our edi and internet solutions may be vulnerable to viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions 
any failure to provide secure infrastructure and or electronic communication services could result in a lack of trust by our clients causing them to seek out other vendors and or damage our reputation in the market  making it difficult to obtain new clients 
we are subject to the development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure  which is not within our control  and which may diminish internet usage and availability as well as access to our web site 
we deliver internet based services and  accordingly  we are dependent on the maintenance of the internet by third parties 
the internet infrastructure may be unable to support the demands placed on it and our performance may decrease if the internet continues to experience its historic trend of expanding usage 
as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure  the internet has experienced a variety of performance problems which may continue into the foreseeable future 
such internet related problems may diminish internet usage and availability of the internet to us for transmittal of our internet based services 
in addition  difficulties  outages 
table of contents and delays by internet service providers  online service providers and other web site operators may obstruct or diminish access to our web site by our clients resulting in a loss of potential or existing users of our services 
our products may be subject to product liability legal claims  which could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
certain of our products provide applications that relate to patient clinical information 
any failure by our products to provide accurate and timely information concerning patients  their medication  treatment and health status  generally  could result in claims against us which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance  industry reputation and ability to market new system sales 
in addition  a court or government agency may take the position that our delivery of health information directly  including through licensed practitioners  or delivery of information by a third party site that a consumer accesses through our web sites  exposes us to assertions of malpractice  other personal injury liability  or other liability for wrongful delivery handling of healthcare services or erroneous health information 
we maintain insurance to protect against claims associated with the use of our products as well as liability limitation language in our end user license agreements  but there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage or contractual language would adequately cover any claim asserted against us 
a successful claim brought against us in excess of or outside of our insurance coverage could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
even unsuccessful claims could result in our expenditure of funds for litigation and management time and resources 
certain healthcare professionals who use our internet based products will directly enter health information about their patients including information that constitutes a record under applicable law that we may store on our computer systems 
numerous federal and state laws and regulations  the common law and contractual obligations  govern collection  dissemination  use and confidentiality of patient identifiable health information  including state and federal privacy and confidentiality laws  our contracts with clients and partners  state laws regulating healthcare professionals  medicaid laws  the hipaa and related rules proposed by the health care financing administration  and health care financing administration standards for internet transmission of health data 
hipaa establishes elements including  but not limited to  federal privacy and security standards for the use and protection of protected health information 
any failure by us or by our personnel or partners to comply with applicable requirements may result in a material liability to us 
although we have systems and policies in place for safeguarding protected health information from unauthorized disclosure  these systems and policies may not preclude claims against us for alleged violations of applicable requirements 
also  third party sites and or links that consumers may access through our web sites may not maintain adequate systems to safeguard this information  or may circumvent systems and policies we have put in place 
in addition  future laws or changes in current laws may necessitate costly adaptations to our policies  procedures  or systems 
there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to product liability claims  that such claims will not result in liability in excess of our insurance coverage  that our insurance will cover such claims or that appropriate insurance will continue to be available to us in the future at commercially reasonable rates 
such product liability claims could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are subject to the effect of payor and provider conduct which we cannot control and accordingly  there is no assurance that revenue for our services will continue at historic levels 
we offer certain electronic claims submission products and services as part of our product line 
while we have implemented certain product features designed to maximize the accuracy and completeness of claims submissions  these features may not be sufficient to prevent inaccurate claims data from being submitted to payors 
should inaccurate claims data be submitted to payors  we may be subject to liability claims 
electronic data transmission services are offered by certain payors to healthcare providers that establish a direct link between the provider and payor 
this process reduces revenue to third party edi service providers such as us 
as a result of this  or other market factors  we are unable to ensure that we will continue to generate revenue at or in excess of prior levels for such services 
a significant increase in the utilization of direct links between healthcare providers and payors could adversely affect our transaction volume and financial results 
in addition  we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain our existing links to payors or develop new connections on terms that are economically satisfactory to us  if at all 
risks related to regulation we face increasing involvement of the federal government in our industry  which may give rise to uncertain and unwarranted expectations concerning the benefits we are to receive from government funding and programs 
in february  president obama signed the american recovery and reinvestment act arra  which allocates over billion dollars to healthcare it over the next several years 
the provision of the legislation that addresses health information technology specifically is known as the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech act 
under the provisions of hitech act  the arra includes significant financial incentives to healthcare providers who can demonstrate meaningful use of certified ehr technology beginning in while the company expects the arra to create 
table of contents significant opportunities for sales of nextgen ehr over the next several years  we are unsure of the immediate impact from the arra and the long term potential could be significant 
in order for our customers to qualify for incentives related to ehr use  our products must meet various requirements for product certification under the regulations and must enable our customers to achieve meaningful use  as such term is currently defined under the july  final rule adopted by the centers for medicare medicaid services  us department of health and human services cms  and under any future regulations and guidance that cms may release related to the incentive program 
the cms final rule provides for a phased approach to implementation of the meaningful use standards  with stage set forth in the final rule and stages and reserved for future rulemaking based upon the experiences with stage also  a final rule has been implemented by the office of national coordinator  us department of health and human services  to adopt an initial set of standards  implementation specifications  and certification criteria to enhance the use of health information technology and support its meaningful use 
given that cms will release future regulations related to electronic health records  our ability to achieve product certification by cchit and other regulatory bodies  and the length  if any  of additional related development and other efforts required to meet meaningful use standards could materially impact our ability to compete and to maximize our market opportunity 
we face the risks and uncertainties that are associated with litigation against us  which may adversely impact our marketing  distract management and have a negative impact upon our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we face the risks associated with litigation concerning the operation of our business 
the uncertainty associated with substantial unresolved litigation may have an adverse effect on our business 
in particular  such litigation could impair our relationships with existing clients and our ability to obtain new clients 
defending such litigation may result in a diversion of management s time and attention away from business operations  which could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
such litigation may also have the effect of discouraging potential acquirers from bidding for us or reducing the consideration such acquirers would otherwise be willing to pay in connection with an acquisition 
there can be no assurance that such litigation will not result in liability in excess of our insurance coverage  that our insurance will cover such claims or that appropriate insurance will continue to be available to us in the future at commercially reasonable rates 
because we believe that proprietary rights are material to our success  misappropriation of these rights could adversely affect our financial condition 
we are heavily dependent on the maintenance and protection of our intellectual property and we rely largely on license agreements  confidentiality procedures and employee nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property 
our software is not patented and existing copyright laws offer only limited practical protection 
there can be no assurance that the legal protections and precautions we take will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that competitors will not independently develop technologies equivalent or superior to ours 
further  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states and are often not enforced as vigorously as those in the united states 
we do not believe that our operations or products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others 
however  there can be no assurance that others will not assert infringement or trade secret claims against us with respect to our current or future products or that any such assertion will not require us to enter into a license agreement or royalty arrangement or other financial arrangement with the party asserting the claim 
responding to and defending any such claims may distract the attention of our management and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  claims may be brought against third parties from which we purchase software  and such claims could adversely affect our ability to access third party software for our systems 
if we are deemed to infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties  we could incur unanticipated expense and be prevented from providing our products and services 
we are and may continue to be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of our competitors grows and our applications functionality is viewed as similar or overlapping with competitive products 
we do not believe that we have infringed or are infringing on any proprietary rights of third parties 
however  claims are occasionally asserted against us  and we cannot assure you that infringement claims will not be asserted against us in the future 
also  we cannot assure you that any such claims will be unsuccessful 
we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources defending any infringement claims even if we are ultimately successful in the defense of such matters 
furthermore  a party making a claim against us could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages  as well as injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to provide products or services 
in addition  we cannot assure you that licenses for any intellectual property of third parties that might be required for our products or services will be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
we are dependent on our license rights and other services from third parties  which may cause us to discontinue  delay or reduce product shipments 
we depend upon licenses for some of the technology used in our products as well as other services from third party vendors 
most of these arrangements can be continued renewed only by mutual consent and may be terminated for any number of reasons 
we may not be able to continue using the products or services made available to us under these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
as a result  we may have to discontinue  delay or reduce product shipments or services provided until we can obtain equivalent technology or services 
most of our third party licenses are non exclusive 
our competitors may obtain the right to use any of the business elements covered by these arrangements and use these elements to compete directly with us 
in addition  if our vendors choose to discontinue providing their technology or services in the future or are unsuccessful in their continued research and development efforts  we may not be able to modify or adapt our own products 

table of contents there is significant uncertainty in the healthcare industry in which we operate  and we are subject to the possibility of changing government regulation  which may adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the healthcare industry is subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences that may affect the procurement processes and operation of healthcare facilities 
during the past several years  the healthcare industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation of  among other things  reimbursement rates and certain capital expenditures 
recently enacted public laws reforming the us healthcare system may have an impact on our business 
the patient protection and affordable care act hr  public law ppaca and the health care and education reconciliation act of hr the reconciliation act  which amends the ppaca collectively the health reform laws  were signed into law in march the health reform laws contain various provisions which may impact us and our customers 
some of these provisions may have a positive impact  by expanding the use of electronic health records in certain federal programs  for example  while others  such as reductions in reimbursement for certain types of providers  may have a negative impact due to fewer available resources 
increases in fraud and abuse penalties may also adversely affect participants in the health care sector  including us 
various legislators have announced that they intend to examine further proposals to reform certain aspects of the us healthcare system 
healthcare providers may react to these proposals  and the uncertainty surrounding such proposals  by curtailing or deferring investments  including those for our systems and related services 
cost containment measures instituted by healthcare providers as a result of regulatory reform or otherwise could result in a reduction in the allocation of capital funds 
such a reduction could have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our systems and related services 
on the other hand  changes in the regulatory environment have increased and may continue to increase the needs of healthcare organizations for cost effective data management and thereby enhance the overall market for healthcare management information systems 
we cannot predict what effect  if any  such proposals or healthcare reforms might have on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as existing regulations mature and become better defined  we anticipate that these regulations will continue to directly affect certain of our products and services  but we cannot fully predict the effect at this time 
we have taken steps to modify our products  services and internal practices as necessary to facilitate our compliance with the regulations  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in a timely or complete manner 
achieving compliance with these regulations could be costly and distract management s attention and divert other company resources  and any noncompliance by us could result in civil and criminal penalties 
developments of additional federal and state regulations and policies have the potential to positively or negatively affect our business 
our software may potentially be subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration fda as a medical device 
such regulation could require the registration of the applicable manufacturing facility and software and hardware products  application of detailed record keeping and manufacturing standards  and fda approval or clearance prior to marketing 
an approval or clearance requirement could create delays in marketing  and the fda could require supplemental filings or object to certain of these applications  the result of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be subject to false or fraudulent claim laws 
there are numerous federal and state laws that forbid submission of false information or the failure to disclose information in connection with submission and payment of physician claims for reimbursement 
in some cases  these laws also forbid abuse of existing systems for such submission and payment 
any failure of our rcm services to comply with these laws and regulations could result in substantial liability including  but not limited to  criminal liability  could adversely affect demand for our services and could force us to expend significant capital  research and development and other resources to address the failure 
errors by us or our systems with respect to entry  formatting  preparation or transmission of claim information may be determined or alleged to be in violation of these laws and regulations 
determination by a court or regulatory agency that our services violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties  invalidate all or portions of some of our client contracts  require us to change or terminate some portions of our business  require us to refund portions of our services fees  cause us to be disqualified from serving clients doing business with government payors and have an adverse effect on our business 
in most cases where we are permitted to do so  we calculate charges for our rcm services based on a percentage of the collections that our clients receive as a result of our services 
to the extent that violations or liability for violations of these laws and regulations require intent  it may be alleged that this percentage calculation provides us or our employees with incentive to commit or overlook fraud or abuse in connection with submission and payment of reimbursement claims 
the us centers for medicare and medicaid services has stated that it is concerned that percentage based billing services may encourage billing companies to commit or to overlook fraudulent or abusive practices 
a portion of our business involves billing of medicare claims on behalf of its clients 
in an effort to combat fraudulent medicare claims  the federal government offers rewards for reporting of medicare fraud which could encourage others to subject us to a charge of fraudulent claims  including charges that are ultimately proven to be without merit 
if our products fail to comply with evolving government and industry standards and regulations  we may have difficulty selling our products 
we may be subject to additional federal and state statutes and regulations in connection with offering services and products via the internet 
on an increasingly frequent basis  federal and state legislators are proposing laws and regulations that apply to internet commerce and communications 
areas being affected by these regulations include user privacy  pricing  content  taxation  copyright protection  distribution  and quality of products and services 
to the extent that our products and services are subject to these laws and regulations  the sale of our products and services could be harmed 

table of contents we are subject to changes in and interpretations of financial accounting matters that govern the measurement of our performance  one or more of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  cash flows  revenue and results of operations 
based on our reading and interpretations of relevant guidance  principles or concepts issued by  among other authorities  the american institute of certified public accountants  the financial accounting standards board and the commission  we believe our current sales and licensing contract terms and business arrangements have been properly reported 
however  there continue to be issued interpretations and guidance for applying the relevant standards to a wide range of sales and licensing contract terms and business arrangements that are prevalent in the software industry 
future interpretations or changes by the regulators of existing accounting standards or changes in our business practices could result in changes in our revenue recognition and or other accounting policies and practices that could adversely affect our business  financial condition  cash flows  revenue and results of operations 
failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of could have an adverse effect on our business  and our per share price may be adversely affected 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of section and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec to implement section  we are required to include in our form k a report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
the report includes  among other things  an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
the assessment must include disclosure of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 
as part of the ongoing evaluation being undertaken by management and our independent registered public accountants pursuant to section  our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of march  however  if we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls or internal controls over financial reporting  we may discover material weaknesses that we would then be required to disclose 
any material weaknesses identified in our internal controls could have an adverse effect on our business 
we may not be able to accurately or timely report on our financial results  and we might be subject to investigation by regulatory authorities 
this could result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which may have an adverse effect on our stock price 
no evaluation process can provide complete assurance that our internal controls will detect and correct all failures within our company to disclose material information otherwise required to be reported 
the effectiveness of our controls and procedures could also be limited by simple errors or faulty judgments 
in addition  if we continue to expand  through either organic growth or through acquisitions or both  the challenges involved in implementing appropriate controls will increase and may require that we evolve some or all of our internal control processes 
it is also possible that the overall scope of section may be revised in the future  thereby causing our auditors and ourselves to review  revise or reevaluate our internal control processes which may result in the expenditure of additional human and financial resources 
risks related to ownership of our common stock the unpredictability of our quarterly operating results may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate or decline 
our revenue may fluctuate in the future from quarter to quarter and period to period  as a result of a number of factors including  without limitation the size and timing of orders from clients  the specific mix of software  hardware and services in client orders  the length of sales cycles and installation processes  the ability of our clients to obtain financing for the purchase of our products  changes in pricing policies or price reductions by us or our competitors  the timing of new product announcements and product introductions by us or our competitors  changes in revenue recognition or other accounting guidelines employed by us and or established by the financial accounting standards board or other rule making bodies  accounting policies concerning the timing of the recognition of revenue  the availability and cost of system components  the financial stability of clients  market acceptance of new products  applications and product enhancements  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products  applications and product enhancements  our success in expanding our sales and marketing programs  deferrals of client orders in anticipation of new products  applications  product enhancements  or public private sector initiatives  execution of or changes to our strategy  personnel changes  and general market economic factors 
our software products are generally shipped as orders are received and accordingly  we have historically operated with a minimal backlog of license fees 
as a result  revenue in any quarter is dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter and is not predictable with any degree of certainty 
furthermore  our systems can be relatively large and expensive  and individual systems sales can represent a significant portion of our revenue and profits for a quarter such that the loss or deferral of even one such sale can adversely affect our quarterly revenue and profitability 

table of contents clients often defer systems purchases until our quarter end  so quarterly results generally cannot be predicted and frequently are not known until after the quarter has concluded 
our sales are dependent upon clients initial decisions to replace or substantially modify their existing information systems  and subsequently  their decision concerning which products and services to purchase 
these are major decisions for healthcare providers and  accordingly  the sales cycle for our systems can vary significantly and typically ranges from six to twenty four months from initial contact to contract execution shipment 
because a significant percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed  a variation in the timing of systems sales  implementations and installations can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
as a result  we believe that interim period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
further  our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of future performance for any particular period 
we currently recognize revenue pursuant to financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  software  revenue recognition  or asc asc summarizes the fasb s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
there can be no assurance that application and subsequent interpretations of these pronouncements will not further modify our revenue recognition policies  or that such modifications would not adversely affect our operating results reported in any particular quarter or year 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is possible that our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of our common stock would likely be adversely affected 
our common stock price has been volatile  which could result in substantial losses for investors purchasing shares of our common stock and in litigation against us 
volatility may be caused by a number of factors including but not limited to actual or anticipated quarterly variations in operating results  rumors about our performance  software solutions  or merger and acquisition activity  changes in expectations of future financial performance or changes in estimates of securities analysts  governmental regulatory action  health care reform measures  client relationship developments  purchases or sales of company stock  activities by one or more of our major shareholders concerning our policies and operations  changes occurring in the markets in general  macroeconomic conditions  both nationally and internationally  and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
furthermore  the stock market in general  and the market for software  healthcare and high technology companies in particular  has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of actual operating performance 
moreover  in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
we may in the future be the target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
two of our directors are significant shareholders  which makes it possible for them to have significant influence over the outcome of all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval and which influence may be alleged to conflict with our interests and the interests of our other shareholders 
two of our directors and principal shareholders beneficially owned an aggregate of approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock at march  california law and our bylaws permit our shareholders to cumulate their votes  the effect of which is to provide shareholders with sufficiently large concentrations of our shares the opportunity to assure themselves one or more seats on our board of directors 
the amounts required to assure a board position can vary based upon the number of shares outstanding  the number of shares voting  the number of directors to be elected  the number of broker non votes  and the number of shares held by the shareholder exercising cumulative voting rights 
in the event that cumulative voting is invoked  it is likely that the two of our directors holding an aggregate of approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock at march  will each have sufficient votes to assure themselves of one or more seats on our board of directors 
with or without cumulative voting  these shareholders will have significant influence over the outcome of all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval  including the election of our directors and other corporate actions 
in fiscal year  one of the principal shareholders  ahmed hussein  proposed a different slate of directors than what the company proposed to shareholders 
the company spent approximately million to defend the company s slate 
in addition  such influence by one or both of these shareholders could have the effect of discouraging others from attempting to purchase us or to implement a change over our board of directors  which could result in a reduction of the market price offered for our common stock in such an event 

table of contents our future policy concerning the payment of dividends is uncertain  which could adversely affect the price of our stock 
we have announced our intention to pay a quarterly dividend commencing with the conclusion of our first fiscal quarter of june  and pursuant to this policy our board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend ranging from to its most recent level of per share on our outstanding shares of common stock  each quarter thereafter 
we anticipate that future quarterly dividends  if and when declared by our board of directors pursuant to this policy  would likely be distributable on or about the fifth day of each of the months of october  january  april and july 
there can be no guarantees that we will have the financial wherewithal to fund this dividend in perpetuity or to pay it at historic rates 
further  our board of directors may decide not to pay the dividend at some future time for financial or non financial reasons 
unfulfilled expectations regarding future dividends could adversely affect the price of our stock

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial statements and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate estimates including but not limited to those related to revenue recognition  uncollectible accounts receivable  software development cost  intangible assets and self insurance accruals for reasonableness 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents we believe that the significant accounting policies  as described in note of our consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the following table depicts the most critical accounting policies that affect our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition judgments and uncertainties we generate revenue from the sale of licensing rights to use our software products sold directly to end users and value added resellers  or vars 
we also generate revenue from sales of hardware and third party software  implementation  training  software customization  edi  post contract support maintenance and other services  including rcm services  performed for clients who license our products 
revenue from implementation and training services is recognized as the corresponding services are performed 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual maintenance period 
rcm revenue is derived from services fees  which include amounts charged for ongoing billing and other related services and are generally billed to the client as a percentage of total collections 
we do not recognize revenue for services fees until these collections are made as the services fees are not fixed or determinable until such time 
a typical system contract contains multiple elements of the above items 
fasb asc topic  software  revenue recognition  multiple elements  or asc  requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements 
the fair value of an element must be based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management having the relevant authority to do so  for an element not yet sold separately 
vsoe calculations are updated and reviewed at the end of each quarter or annually depending on the nature of the product or service 
we have established vsoe for the related undelivered elements based on the bell shaped curve method 
maintenance vsoe for our largest clients is based on stated renewal rates only if the rate is determined to be substantive and falls within our customary pricing practices 
when evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered elements only  the residual method  provided for under asc  is used 
under the residual method  we defer revenue related to the undelivered elements in a system sale based on vsoe of fair value of each of the undelivered elements and allocate the remainder of the contract price net of all discounts to revenue recognized from the delivered elements 
undelivered elements of a system sale may include implementation and training services  hardware and third party software  maintenance  future purchase discounts  or other services 
if vsoe of fair value of any undelivered element does not exist  all revenue is deferred until vsoe of fair value of the undelivered element is established or the element has been delivered 
we bill for the entire system sales contract amount upon contract execution  except for maintenance which is billed separately 
amounts billed in excess of the amounts contractually due are recorded in accounts receivable as advance billings 
amounts are contractually due when services are performed or in accordance with contractually specified payment dates 
provided the fees are fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable  revenue from licensing rights and sales of hardware and third party software is generally recognized upon shipment and transfer of title 
in certain transactions whose collections risk is high  the cash basis method is used to recognize revenue 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  then the revenue recognized in each period subject to application of other revenue recognition criteria will be the lesser of the aggregate of amounts due and payable or the amount of the arrangement fee that would have been recognized if the fees were being recognized using the residual method 
fees which are considered fixed or determinable at the inception of our arrangements must include the following characteristics the fee must be negotiated at the outset of an arrangement and generally be based on the specific volume of products to be delivered without being subject to change based on variable pricing mechanisms such as the number of units copied or distributed or the expected number of users  and payment terms must not be considered extended 
if a significant portion of the fee is due more than months after delivery or after the expiration of the license  the fee is presumed not fixed or determinable 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in revenue that could be material 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts judgments and uncertainties we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
we perform credit evaluations of our clients and maintain reserves for estimated credit losses 
reserves for potential credit losses are determined by establishing both specific and general reserves 
specific reserves are based on management s estimate of the probability of collection for certain troubled accounts 
general reserves are established based on our historical experience of bad debt expense and the aging of our accounts receivable balances net of deferred revenue and specifically reserved accounts 
if the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in required reserves that could be material 
software development costs judgments and uncertainties development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products for external use are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
after technological feasibility is established  any additional external software development costs are capitalized in accordance with fasb asc topic  software  costs of computer software to be sold  leased or marketed  or asc such capitalized costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the related product  which is typically three years 
we perform an annual review of the estimated economic life and the recoverability of such capitalized software costs 
if a determination is made that capitalized amounts are not recoverable based on the estimated cash flows to be generated from the applicable software  any remaining capitalized amounts are written off 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in revenue that could be material 
goodwill judgments and uncertainties goodwill is related to nextgen and the hsi  pmp  nextgen is and opus acquisitions  which closed on may   october   august  and february   respectively 
in accordance with fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  goodwill  or asc  we test goodwill for impairment annually at the end of our first fiscal quarter  referred to as the annual test date  and have determined that there was no impairment to our goodwill as of june  we will also test for impairment between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired 
impairment testing for goodwill is performed at a reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below and operating segment referred to as a component 
a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
we have determined that nextgen  hsi and pmp each qualify as a separate reporting unit while nextgen is and opus are aggregated as one reporting unit at which goodwill impairment testing is performed 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the past three fiscal years 
the carrying values of goodwill at march  and were million and million  respectively 
an impairment loss would generally be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
as of march  and  we have not identified any events or circumstances that would require an interim goodwill impairment test 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill and other intangible assets 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 

table of contents business combinations purchase price allocations during the last three fiscal years  we completed three significant acquisitions in february  we acquired opus for million 
in october  we acquired pmp for million  including transaction costs 
in may  we acquired hsi for million  including transaction costs 
judgments and uncertainties in accordance with business combination accounting under fasb asc topic  business combinations  or asc  we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values 
our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices  the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses 
unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates  including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to complete the purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
intangible assets judgments and uncertainties intangible assets consist of capitalized software costs  customer relationships  trade names and certain intellectual property 
intangible assets related to customer relationships  trade names and software technology arose in connection with the acquisition of hsi  pmp  nextgen is and opus 
these intangible assets were recorded at fair value and are stated net of accumulated amortization 
intangible assets are amortized over their remaining estimated useful lives  ranging from to years 
our amortization policy for intangible assets is based on the principles in fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  general intangibles other than goodwill  or asc  which requires that the amortization of intangible assets reflect the pattern that the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to decreases in the fair value of our intangible assets  resulting in impairment charges that could be material 
share based compensation judgments and uncertainties our stock based compensation plans consist of stock options and restricted stock units 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our stock based compensation programs 
we apply the provisions of fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation  or asc  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
asc requires us to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
expected term is estimated using historical exercise experience 
volatility is estimated by using the weighted average historical volatility of our common stock  which approximates expected volatility 
the risk free rate is the implied yield available on the u 
s treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms equal to the expected term 
the expected dividend yield is the average dividend rate during a period equal to the expected term of the option 
those inputs are then entered into the black scholes model to determine the estimated fair value 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized ratably as expense over the requisite service period in our consolidated statements of income 
on may   the board of directors approved its fiscal year equity incentive program for certain employees to be awarded options to purchase the company s common stock 
under the program  executives are eligible to receive options based on meeting certain target increases in earnings per share performance and revenue growth during fiscal year non executive employees also are eligible to receive options based on satisfying certain management established criteria and recommendations of senior management 
compensation expense associated with the performance based awards under the company s incentive plan are initially based on the number of options expected to vest after assessing the probability that certain performance criteria will be met 
cumulative adjustments are recorded quarterly to reflect subsequent changes in the estimated outcome of performance related conditions 

table of contents share based compensation continued effect if actual results differ from assumptions we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to changes in stock based compensation expense that could be material 
self insured liabilities judgments and uncertainties effective january   we became self insured with respect to healthcare claims  subject to stop loss limits 
we accrue for estimated self insurance costs and uninsured exposures based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported as of each balance sheet date 
however  it is possible that recorded accruals may not be adequate to cover the future payment of claims 
adjustments  if any  to estimated accruals resulting from ultimate claim payments will be reflected in earnings during the periods in which such adjustments are determined 
our self insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our self insured liabilities 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

table of contents overview of our results consolidated revenue increased and income from operations grew by in the year ended march  as compared to the prior year period 
revenue was positively impacted by growth in recurring revenue  including maintenance  edi and rcm revenue  which grew  and  respectively and accounted for of total consolidated revenue for the year ended march  in the same period a year ago  recurring revenue represented of total consolidated revenue 
revenue was also positively impacted by growth in sales of systems  which increased in the year ended march  as compared to the prior year period 
the increase in income from operations was partially offset by a higher selling  general and administrative expenses  which was primarily a result of increased headcount expenses and selling related expenses at the nextgen division  b increased research and development costs  c higher corporate related expenses  d amortization of the software technology intangible asset related to the opus acquisition that is included in cost of sales  and e additional expenses related to a fair value adjustment to the contingent consideration liability related to the acquisitions of opus and nextgen is 
we have benefited and hope to continue to benefit from the increased demands on healthcare providers for greater efficiency and lower costs  financial incentives from the arra to physicians who adopt electronic health records  as well as increased adoption rates for electronic health records and other technology in the healthcare arena 
while we expect to benefit from the increasing demands for greater efficiency as well as government support for increased adoption of electronic health records  the current economic environment  combined with unpredictability of the federal government s plans to promote increased adoption of electronic medical records  makes the near term achievement of such benefits and  ultimately  their impact on system sales  uncertain
