item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part ii  item of this report 
overview we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from lithography tool manufacturers and chipmakers  therefore  we are subject to the volatile and unpredictable cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry 
the semiconductor equipment industry historically has experienced ups and downs  some of them more pronounced than others 
after a significant downturn in the global economy and the semiconductor industry in late and early  we saw a strengthening in the global economy and the semiconductor industry that started in late and continued throughout during the downturn  we focused on cost structure improvements and operational efficiencies  while continuing to focus on providing comprehensive support products for the installed base and investments in the development and commercialization of our euv source technology and silicon crystallization tools 
as a result  we were well positioned for the upturn 
during  we improved our duv competitive position and increased our onpulse coverage  while adding advanced performance enhancements to our light source systems 
we shipped four euv pilot sources in  and we will record revenue associated with these euv sources when customer acceptance is received 
we also recorded our first sale of a tcz silicon crystallization tool in revenue of million in represented a increase over light source revenue grew and installed based product revenue grew over the prior year 
the majority of our light source shipments continued to be arf sources in support of nm and below immersion lithography  and we also delivered several krf sources to support increased semiconductor manufacturing 
we also made significant progress demonstrating the value of our installed base products  particularly onpulse as over of our top chipmaker customers have adopted onpulse 
our continued investment in euv sources and tcz silicon crystallization tools also showed positive momentum in we shipped four euv pilot sources in  and  in december  we installed the first euv pilot source system at a memory manufacturer 
we anticipate that the first customer acceptance of one of our euv pilot sources may occur in our tcz reporting segment develops  integrates  markets and supports silicon crystallization tools used in the manufacture of different types of displays  including ltps lcd and oled flat panel displays 
we recorded our first sale of a tcz silicon crystallization tool and installed a second tool at a second customer during we expect to record revenue for this second tool in gross margin was in  an increase over gross margin of in the increase in gross margin over the prior year was driven primarily by our continued focus on operational execution  previously implemented cost structure improvements  improved manufacturing absorption  lower write downs of inventory  decreases in warranty expenses due to light source reliability improvements  and lower freight costs as a percentage of revenue 
operating expenses of million in represent a increase over due primarily to our increased investments in the development and commercialization of our euv source technology and silicon crystallization tools and increased costs associated with variable compensation programs that are closely linked to improvements in business levels and company performance 
as a percentage of revenue  operating expenses decreased to in from in our effective tax rate decreased to in from in due primarily to an increase in our research and development tax credits in  the occurrence of foreign losses in that could not be benefited  and an increase in our ability to utilize the us manufacturing benefit due to increased profitability in additionally  we recorded tax benefits totaling million related to a foreign tax audit and the revocation of a tax liability in singapore 
as a result of the factors discussed above  we delivered net income of million in  compared to net income of million in additionally  the strong performance in generated cash flows from operations of million  and our cash and investments balance grew to million at december  
table of contents we believe we are well positioned for growth in our attention to light source reliability  customer productivity  and cost of operations have resulted in several recent key light source selections from chipmakers  some of whom have recently announced significant increases to their capital expenditure plans 
we believe this increase in capital investment will translate into continued growth for us 
we also expect that pulse value will continue to rise as the mix of arf pulses grows and our installed base of revenue producing light sources increases 
we will continue to invest in the development and commercialization of our euv source technology and will increase manufacturing capability to respond to the growing demand for our silicon crystallization tools 
our corporate priorities in are clear successful euv development and commercialization  continued duv sales competitiveness  extending our success of delivering onpulse value and reliability  and fulfilling growing demand for our tcz silicon crystallization tools 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and use judgment that may impact the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
as a part of our ongoing internal processes  we regularly evaluate our estimates and judgments associated with revenue recognition  inventory valuation  warranty obligations  stock based compensation  income taxes  allowances for doubtful accounts  long lived assets valuation  goodwill valuation  assets and liabilities valuation  and contingencies and litigation 
we base these estimates and judgments upon historical information  projected information  and other facts and assumptions that we believe to be valid and reasonable under the circumstances 
these assumptions and facts form the basis for making judgments and estimates and for determining the carrying values of our assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources 
adverse global economic conditions  illiquid credit markets  volatile equity  foreign currency fluctuations and declines in consumer spending have increased the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions 
as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision  particularly those related to the condition of the economy  actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
we believe that revenue recognition  inventory valuation  warranty obligations  stock based compensation  allowance for doubtful accounts  long lived assets valuation  and income taxes require more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements than do other of our accounting estimates and judgments 
revenue recognition our revenues include light source systems and installed base products  which consist of onpulse contracts  service support and replacement parts  and to a lesser extent  service  upgrades  and refurbishments of our light source systems 
additionally  in  we recorded our first sale of a silicon crystallization tool 
we recognize revenue when title and risk of loss have passed  evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  pricing is fixed or determinable at the date of sale  and collectability is reasonably assured 
our sales arrangements do not include general rights of return or cancellation privileges 
light source systems and silicon crystallization tools we recognize system revenue at one of the following three points  depending on the terms of our arrangement with our customer shipment of the system  delivery of the system  or receipt of an acceptance certificate from the customer 
for the majority of our system sales  the shipping terms are fob shipping point  and revenue is recognized upon shipment 

table of contents certain of our revenue arrangements include additional elements  such as future product upgrades or services 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition arrangements with multiple deliverables  we allocate the total consideration in the arrangement to the multiple elements using the relative selling price of the delivered and undelivered items  based on vendor specific objective evidence or estimated selling price  if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  as third party evidence is generally not available to us due to the proprietary nature of our products 
the estimated selling price is determined considering market conditions and estimated gross margins  as well as factors that are specific to us 
through  our light source system sales have been of our duv light source systems only 
we shipped four euv pilot light sources in  and we will record revenue associated with these euv sources when customer acceptance is received 
additionally  in  we recorded our first sale of a silicon crystallization tool 
installed base products onpulse contracts  service support  and replacement parts revenue associated with our onpulse contracts  which include primarily replacement parts and to a much lesser extent services  is recognized monthly based on the number of pulses utilized by our customers on their laser source systems that are covered under their onpulse arrangement 
revenue from service is recognized as the services are rendered 
to date  the revenue associated with the service element of our onpulse contracts when combined with our service revenue has been less than of our total revenue 
for our replacement part sales  the shipping terms are fob shipping point  and revenue is recognized upon shipment 
for a significant portion of our replacement parts revenue  our customers return the consumed assembly to us as part of the sale of the new part 
we reuse some of the material within these core assemblies  mainly metal components  for the future build of core assemblies 
as a result  our revenue consists of both cash and the fair value of the reusable parts received from our customers as consideration for these replacement part sales 
revenue associated with our customers return of core assemblies is recognized upon receipt of the returned core assembly 
the amount of the revenue is determined based upon the fair value of the reusable parts that we expect to yield from the returned core assembly based on historical experience 
if the return of the core assembly is related to a part being replaced under our warranty provisions or under a service or support contract with our customer  we will recognize the estimated fair value of the reusable component as a reduction to cost of revenue 
on a limited basis  we sell upgrades for our light source systems or refurbish light source systems owned by our customers to their original or new condition 
revenue from upgrades is recognized when the upgrade has been successfully installed by us and accepted by the customer 
revenue from refurbished light source systems is recognized when the refurbishment process has been completed and  depending upon the customer  the proper delivery or acceptance terms have been met 
we report revenue net of any sales based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on or concurrent with sales transactions 
deferred revenue deferred revenue represents payments received from our customers in advance of the delivery of products and or services or before the satisfaction of all revenue recognition requirements  as described above 
inventory valuation our inventories are recorded at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or estimated market value 
our inventories include raw materials  work in process  finished goods  and replacement and reusable parts  which we use in our contract arrangements  refurbishment activities and warranty obligations 

table of contents as part of our regular business activities  we conduct parts refurbishment and material reclamation activities related to some of our core assemblies  particularly our chamber assemblies 
we receive consumed core assemblies back from our customers as partial consideration for the purchase of new parts or when core assemblies are replaced under onpulse contracts or warranty claims 
the fair value of the reusable parts contained within the consumed assembly is recorded in inventory based upon historical data on the value of the reusable parts that we typically yield from a consumed core assembly 
obsolete inventory  or inventory for which we do not have expected usage based on our forecasted demand  is written down to its estimated market value  if less than its cost 
the methodologies used to analyze excess and obsolete inventory and determine the value of our inventory are significantly affected by future demand and usage of our products 
there are many factors that could potentially affect the future demand or usage of our products  including the following condition of the semiconductor and flat panel display industries  which are cyclical in nature  rate at which our customers take delivery of our systems and our replacement parts  loss of any of our major customers or a significant change in demand from any of these customers  overall mix of system models or replacement parts and any changes to that mix required by our customers  utilization rates of our light sources at chipmakers  overall condition of the global economy which can positively or negatively impact the demand for our products  customer acceptance of new products or discontinued use of our products  and engineering change orders  including those changes inherent in the development of emerging technologies such as euv 
additionally  service level requirements of our customers require us to keep certain levels of replacement parts at or near customer locations 
based upon our experience  we believe that the estimates we use to calculate the value of our inventories are reasonable and properly reflect the risk of excess and obsolete inventory 
during changing or adverse economic conditions or when introducing new products and product lines  it is difficult to estimate the future demand for our products 
as a result  the likelihood that the usage period for our inventory will substantially differ from our estimates is increased 
if actual demand or the usage periods of our inventory are substantially different from our estimates  such differences may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
warranty obligations we maintain an accrual for the estimated cost of product warranties associated with sales of our products 
warranty costs include replacement parts and labor costs to repair our products during the warranty period 
we record a provision for warranty  which is included in cost of revenues  at the time that the related revenue is recognized 
the warranty period and terms for systems and replacement parts varies by system model 
we review our warranty provision using a statistical financial model which calculates actual historical expenses  product failure rates  and potential risks associated with our different product models 
we then use this financial model to calculate the future probable expenses related to warranties and the required level of the warranty provision 
throughout the year  we review the risk levels  historical cost information and failure rates used within this model and update them as information changes over the product s life cycle 
for new product offerings  such as euv sources and tcz crystallization tools  for which we have limited or no historical failure rates  we estimate our future probable expenses related to the warranties based on an evaluation of parts covered under warranty and their expected failure rates determined through internal testing and analysis 
if actual warranty expenditures differ substantially from our estimates  revisions to the warranty provision would be required 
actual warranty expenditures are recorded against the warranty provision as they are incurred 
consumed parts under warranty  
table of contents when returned  are recorded as reductions to warranty expenditures during the period at their estimated fair value 
we do not include the return of consumed parts in our statistical financial model used to estimate our provision for warranty because the specific parts and their estimated future fair value when returned  if any  cannot be reasonably estimated at the time revenue is recorded 
we actively engage in product improvement programs and processes to limit our warranty costs  however  our warranty obligation is affected by the complexity of our product  product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures at customers sites 
the industry in which we operate is subject to rapid technological change  and as a result  we periodically introduce newer  more complex products 
although we classify these newly released products as having a higher risk in our warranty model resulting in higher warranty provisions  we are more likely to have differences between the estimated and actual warranty costs for these new products 
warranty provisions for our older and more established products are more predictable as more historical data is available 
if actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures were to differ from our estimates  revisions to our estimated warranty provision would be required  which could have a material adverse affect on our operating results and financial condition 
stock based compensation the fair value of stock based compensation awards is measured on the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee s requisite service period 
the fair value of the stock award is determined using the black scholes option pricing model for stock options and the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date for restricted stock units 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions including the expected term of the stock options and our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the stock options 
an estimated forfeiture rate is applied and included in the calculation of stock based compensation expense at the time that the stock option or other stock awards  such as our restricted stock unit awards  are granted and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeiture rates differ from those estimates 
if we change any of the key assumptions that we use in the black scholes option pricing model as described above  or if we decide to use a different valuation model in the future or change our forfeiture rate  the compensation expense that we record may differ significantly in the future from what we have recorded in prior periods and could materially affect our operating results 
we also grant performance restricted stock units prsus to our executive officers and certain key employees 
prsus are a form of share based award in which the number of shares ultimately received will be determined based on achievement against defined performance metrics 
grants of prsus during the past three years have contained at least one of the following performance metrics over a defined performance period revenue and net income relative performance compared to a specified group of peer companies  duv install value market share and eligible individual s management by objectives mbo achievement 
we record compensation expense each period based on our estimate of the most probable number of prsus that will be issued 
this estimate requires significant estimates and projections about our financial performance relative to the financial performance of the specified group of peer companies  our duv install value market share and the performance of individuals against their specific mbos 
if our estimates change or actual results are different than the estimates used in prior periods  we would be required to increase or decrease compensation expense  which could materially affect our operating results 
allowance for doubtful accounts the majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to lithography tool manufacturers or semiconductor manufacturer customers located throughout the world 
in order to monitor potential credit losses  we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectability of our accounts receivable 
we take into consideration the following when making this assessment  our customer s payment history and how current they are on paying their outstanding receivables balance  
table of contents our history of successfully collecting on past due or aged receivables from our customers  our customer s current financial condition and any circumstances of which we are aware that would affect our customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  and our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and global economy and their effect on our customers 
if circumstances change  and the financial conditions of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us  or the judgments used by us to determine a customer s allowance prove to be incorrect  we may need to record additional allowances 
in addition  due to our concentrated customer base  the trade receivable balance owed by any one customer can be significant 
as a result  if our assessment of the financial condition of our customers  even a single customer  proves to be incorrect  we would have to record additional and potentially significant allowances and bad debt expense  which would have a material effect on our business  operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
long lived assets valuation included in our long lived assets are property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors that would indicate potential impairment may include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of the long lived asset  a significant change in the long lived asset s physical condition  and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived asset 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows  undiscounted and without interest  expected to be generated by the asset 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of a long lived asset or asset group is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset or asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group 
based on our assessment of potential impairments during  and  there were no factors identified that would indicate an impairment of our long lived assets 
significant judgments and estimates by management are required to project cash flows and  if required  estimate the fair value of the long lived assets 
the estimated future cash flows are based upon  among other things  our strategic plans with regard to our business and operations  assumptions about expected future operating performance  and the interpretation of current and future economic indicators 
to the extent that the judgments used by us to calculate our future cash flows prove to be inaccurate or there are significant changes in market conditions  the overall condition of the global economy or our strategic plans change  it is possible that our conclusions regarding long lived asset impairment could change 
this could result in significant impairment charges  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial position 
income taxes our effective tax rate includes the effect of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the us earnings remittance amounts are planned based on the projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and long term investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations 
material changes in our estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements could affect our effective tax rate 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider past operating results  future market growth  forecasted earnings  historical and projected taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and statutory tax law changes in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
if we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax 
table of contents assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
these changes to the valuation allowance  and resulting increases or decreases in income tax expense  could have a material adverse affect on our operating results 
our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
while we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns  we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes  and adjust the income tax provision  income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items in our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  revenues product sales product sales related party total revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring total operating expenses operating income other income expense income before income taxes income tax expense net income net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest in subsidiary net income attributable to cymer  inc we develop  manufacture and market our products within two reportable business segments  cymer and tcz 
cymer s primary business is to design  manufacture and sell light source systems and installed base 
table of contents products for use in photolithography systems used in the manufacture of semiconductors 
tcz develops  integrates  markets and supports silicon crystallization tools used in the manufacture of ltps lcd and oled flat panel displays 
the discussion which follows for revenues  cost of revenues and operating expenses includes our consolidated results and identifies those amounts associated with the tcz segment  which are included in the consolidated amounts  for the years ended december   and additional information regarding our reporting segments is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
years ended december  and revenues 
the following table summarizes the components of our revenue in thousands  except units sold years ended december  growth decline dollars percent cymer light source systems revenue light source system units sold light source systems average selling price installed base product revenue tcz revenue total revenue for purposes of calculating the average light source system selling price  we have excluded the effect of deferred light source system revenue between periods in order to present the actual average selling price per light source system sold 
total revenue increased primarily due to improved market conditions and chipmaker customers continued investment in new and existing fab expansions 
the increase in light source revenues was primarily due to a higher level of investment in arf light sources in support of nm and below immersion lithography as well as an increase in krf light source purchases 
the average selling price of our light source systems decreased due to an increase in the percentage of light source systems sold that were krf  which have a lower average selling price than arf light source systems 
our installed base product revenue increased due to a continued rise in pulse utilization of our light source systems  increasing pulse value as the mix of arf pulses continues to rise  and an increase in the number of installed base arf light sources 
we also recorded our first tcz segment revenue during the year ended december  for the relocation  installation and final acceptance of a silicon crystallization tool by a large korean display manufacturer 
there were no revenues associated with our tcz segment for the year ended december  our duv backlog includes only those orders for light source systems and replacement parts for which we have accepted a purchase order from a customer  and that will be delivered to the customer within the following months 
in addition  our duv backlog does not include service or support which will be provided to our customers in the future or under service contracts 
timing of delivery can be affected by many factors  including factors that cannot be easily predicted or controlled 
because it is the practice in our industry that customers may cancel or delay orders with little or no penalty  our backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period 
our backlog for duv light source systems and replacement parts at december  was million compared to million at december  duv bookings for the year ended december  and were million and  respectively 
the duv book to bill ratio for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the increase in backlog and bookings year over year primarily reflects the upturn in the semiconductor capital equipment industry as a result of the global economy 

table of contents we also had a backlog of million for euv sources and million for silicon crystallization tools at december  sales to asml  nikon and samsung amounted to  and  respectively  of total revenue for  and  and  respectively  of total revenue for our sales to external customers consist of sales generated from each of the following geographic locations in which we do business in thousands years ended december  growth decline dollars percent united states japan korea taiwan other asia china and singapore europe total revenue we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues includes direct material and labor  warranty expenses  license fees  manufacturing and service overhead 
cost of revenues also includes foreign exchange gains and losses on foreign currency forward exchange contracts forward contracts associated with purchases of our products by cymer japan for resale under firm third party sales commitments 
costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in cost of revenues at the time the related revenue is recognized 
amounts billed to a customer  if any  for shipping and handling are reported as revenue 
the cost of revenues increased to million for from million for the same period in gross profit increased to million with a gross margin for from million with a gross margin for the same period in the increase in gross margin over prior year was driven primarily by our continued focus on operational execution  previously implemented cost structure improvements  improved manufacturing absorption  lower write downs of inventory  decreases in warranty expenses due to light source reliability improvements  and lower freight costs as a percentage of revenue 
included in cost of revenues for was million related to the relocation  installation and final acceptance of our first silicon crystallization tool and installation costs on a second tool and  in for installation costs related to our tcz segment 
research and development 
research and development expenses include costs of continuing product development projects  which consist primarily of employee and material costs  depreciation of equipment and other engineering related costs 
research and development expenses increased to million for from million for the same period in research and development spending increased in as we raised our level of investment in euv source development  increased headcount  and increased costs associated with variable compensation programs that are closely linked to improvements in business levels and company performance 
in  research and development expenses were negatively impacted by the reductions in workforce and adjusted spending on our duv product portfolio 
research and development expenses included million and million for and  respectively  for our tcz segment 
the increase in research and development expenses for tcz is due primarily to assuming full ownership of the joint venture in january as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses decreased to for from for the same period in 
table of contents sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include sales  marketing  customer support staff and other marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million for from million for the same period in included in sales and marketing expenses were million and million for and  respectively  for our tcz segment 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses primarily reflects an increase in headcount and costs associated with variable compensation programs that are closely linked to improvements in business levels and company performance 
as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing decreased to for compared to for general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of management and administrative personnel costs  professional services including external audit and consultant fees  and administrative operating costs 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for the same period in  primarily due to an increase in headcount and costs associated with variable compensation programs that are closely linked to improvements in business levels and company performance 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in bad debt expense as a result of improved risk profiles and payment histories of certain of our customers compared to the same period in included in general and administrative expenses were million and  for and  respectively  for our tcz segment 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to for compared to for restructuring 
there were no restructuring expenses in during  we reduced our worldwide workforce by approximately percent or a total of employees  as part of our cost reduction efforts in response to the deterioration in the lithography sector of the semiconductor capital equipment market at the time 
these reductions in workforce affected only employees at our cymer segment 
as a result of these reductions in our workforce  we recorded restructuring expense of approximately million during other income expense 
other income expense consists primarily of interest income earned on our investment portfolio  foreign currency exchange gains or losses associated with fluctuations in the value of the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries against the us dollar and other items that may be specific to a reporting period 
other expense improved to  of net other income for primarily due to a negligible foreign currency loss compared to other expense of  for which was primarily due to foreign currency losses of million as a result of the depreciation of the korean won against the us dollar at the beginning of income tax expense 
income tax expense of million and million reflect effective tax rates of and for and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to an increase in our research and development tax credits in  the incurrence of foreign losses in that could not be benefited  and an increase in our ability to utilize the us manufacturing benefit due to increased profitability in we recorded a net tax benefit in the united states of million based on our estimate of the outcome of a foreign tax audit 
we are currently negotiating settlement of this audit with the foreign tax authority and the united states treasury department  and our estimated benefit could change as negotiations evolve 
final resolution of this audit may not be known for several years 
we also recorded a net tax benefit in the united states of  which represents our estimate of tcz net operating loss carryforwards we expect to utilize in the future given the retroactive revocation of tcz s tax holiday in singapore 
the  net tax benefit represents the establishment of a million deferred tax asset  offset by a valuation allowance of million 
our future effective tax rate depends on various factors  such as tax legislation and credits and the geographic compositions of our pre tax income 
additionally  several of our subsidiaries are under audit or appeal 
it is reasonably possible that the examination phase of these audits or appeals may conclude in the next months  and that the related tax reserves or unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions may change  potentially having a material effect on our effective tax rate 

table of contents years ended december  and revenues 
the following table summarizes the components of our revenue in thousands  except units sold years ended december  growth decline dollars percent cymer light source systems revenue light source system units sold light source systems average selling price installed base product revenue total revenue for purposes of calculating the average selling price  we have excluded the effect of deferred light source system revenue between periods in order to present the actual price per light source system sold 
total revenue decreased due to a decline in our light source systems and our installed base product revenues 
the decrease in light source revenue was primarily due to the decline in the number of light source systems sold as a result of the reduced need for capacity expansion by our chipmaker customers  the downturn in the semiconductor capital equipment industry and the deterioration of the global economy 
this decline was offset partially by an increase in the average selling price due to a higher concentration of sales of our most advanced arf light sources for immersion productions applications  which include our xlr series light source systems 
although our installed base product revenue declined year over year due to a decline in pulse utilizations by our chipmaker customers  it did not decline as significantly as our light source systems revenue 
this was due to continued adoption of our onpulse contracts and an increase in the number of installed light source systems 
we did not record any revenue associated with our tcz segment for the year ended december  or sales to asml  nikon  and samsung amounted to  and  respectively  of total revenue for  and  and  respectively  of total revenue for our sales to external customers consist of sales generated from each of the following geographic locations in which we do business in thousands years ended december  growth decline dollars percent united states japan korea taiwan other asia china and singapore europe total revenue cost of revenues 
gross margin decreased to in from in primarily due to million in idle capacity charges and higher costs associated with our installed base products 
the idle capacity charges were associated with unabsorbed manufacturing costs resulting primarily from the decline in light source demand and reduced production levels during these declines in gross margin were offset partially by lower warranty expenses as a percentage of revenue due to a lower number of systems under warranty and a reduction 
table of contents in the write down of inventory when compared to cost of revenues associated with the tcz segment was  for there were no costs of revenues associated with the tcz segment for research and development 
research and development expenses were million and million in and  respectively 
as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses were and in and  respectively 
the decrease in research and development expenses from to primarily reflects the reductions in our workforce and the effect of the other cost reduction actions we implemented in the fourth quarter of and continued into these activities resulted in lower employee compensation and benefit costs  reduced variable compensation costs  and decreased travel and entertainment expenses 
research and development expenses included million and million in and  respectively  for our tcz segment 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million and million in and  respectively 
as a percentage of total revenues  such sales and marketing expenses were and in and  respectively 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses from to primarily reflects a decline of million in employee compensation and benefits  travel and entertainment  and facilities costs as a result of the reductions in workforce and cost reduction actions we implemented in the fourth quarter of and continued into sales and marketing expenses included million and million in and  respectively  for our tcz segment 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million and million in and  respectively 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses were and in and  respectively 
the decline in general and administrative expenses from to primarily reflects a decrease of million in compensation and benefits  professional fees  travel  entertainment  and facilities related costs as a result of the reductions in our workforce and cost reduction actions which we implemented in the fourth quarter of and continued in in addition  we had a decrease in bad debt expense of million 
higher bad debt expense in  driven by the uncertain impact of the recessionary economy on our customers  drove a favorable year over year comparison 
general and administrative expenses included  and  in and  respectively for our tcz segment 
restructuring 
we incurred restructuring expenses  primarily consisting of severance charges  of million in compared to million in in november  we reduced our worldwide workforce by approximately percent or a total of employees 
in the first quarter of  we further reduced our worldwide workforce by approximately percent or a total of employees as part of our cost reduction efforts in response to the deterioration in the global economy and lithography sector of the semiconductor capital equipment market in the fourth quarter of and the first half of as a result of these actions to reduce our cost structure  we realized a cost savings of approximately million from to in our research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses 
we did not record any restructuring expense in or associated with our tcz segment 
other income expense 
net other expense totaled  and million in and  respectively 
the reduction in expense was primarily due to a significant reduction in interest expense as a result of the repayment of our convertible subordinated note in the first quarter of  decreases in foreign currency losses and significantly reduced write downs on investments 
foreign currency losses were million for and were primarily due to the lower volatility in the korean won against the us dollar as a result of the positive impact of our hedging program 
in foreign currency losses were million and were caused by a significant decline in the value of the korean won against the u 
s dollar 
impairment charges on the preferred stock that was distributed to us when an auction rate security was dissolved were  for which reduced the carrying amount of the auction rate preferred stock to zero  compared to impairment charges on the auction rate security of million for in addition  these decreases in other expenses were partially offset by a million reduction in interest and other income year over year as a result of lower overall cash and investment balances and lower interest rate yields 

table of contents income tax expense 
income tax expense of million and million for and  respectively  reflects an annual effective tax rate of and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate from to was due primarily to an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
during  we realized a capital loss of million and provided a full valuation allowance on the related million deferred tax asset  as we believed it was more likely than not that we would not generate sufficient capital gains to utilize the capital loss after consideration of our available tax planning strategies 
in addition  the effect of certain foreign losses with no tax benefit had a larger effect on than due to the fact that the foreign losses remained relatively constant  while pre tax income declined significantly from to liquidity and capital resources in recent years  we have funded our operations primarily from cash generated from operations and proceeds from employee stock option exercises 
we have also from time to time utilized cash to repurchase shares of our common stock 
in summary  our cash flows were as follows in thousands years ended december  net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents we corrected an immaterial error in our previously presented consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended december  and related to the treatment of non cash transfers between inventory and property  plant and equipment 
the effect of the correction on our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december  was to decrease net cash provided by operating activities from million to million and to decrease net cash used in investing activities from million to million 
the effect of the correction on our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december  was to increase net cash used in operating activities from million to million and to decrease net cash used in investing activities from million to million 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in primarily reflects net income for the year as adjusted to exclude the effects of non cash charges  primarily depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation and provision for deferred income taxes 
additionally  increases in other liabilities of million  primarily related to increases in accrued payroll related to variable cash compensation programs  and increases in deferred revenue of million  related to advance payments received from asml for purchase orders under a multi year supply agreement for euv sources and advance payments for a silicon crystallization tool  contributed to positive operating cash flow 
these increases in operating cash flow were offset partially by a million increase in accounts receivable  a million increase in inventory and a million increase in other assets  primarily related to income taxes receivable 
the increase in accounts receivable results primarily from the increase in revenue and  to a lesser extent  an increase in days sales outstanding to days at december  from days at december  the increase in inventory is due primarily to the production of euv sources 
the increase in income taxes receivable is due primarily to the reinstatement of the research and development credit at the end of net cash provided by operating activities in primarily reflects net income for the year as adjusted to exclude the effects of non cash charges  primarily depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation  a reduction in inventory levels  and increases in accounts payable and deferred revenue 
the million decrease 
table of contents in inventory was primarily due to decreases in our spare parts inventory levels during these decreases in our spare parts inventory levels were partially offset by increases in inventory related to euv sources and silicon crystallization tools 
these increases in inventory also resulted in an increase in accounts payable of million 
the increase in deferred revenue of million primarily reflects advance payments received from asml during for purchase orders under a multi year supply agreement for euv sources 
these increases in operating cash flow were offset by increases in accounts receivable and decreases in other liabilities 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily the result of a higher level of shipments occurring later in the fourth quarter  which resulted in higher accounts receivable balances at the end of the year 
the decrease in other liabilities was primarily due to the decrease in our warranty provision as a result of reduced sales and the lower number of light source systems under warranty at december  net cash used in operating activities in primarily reflects lower net income for the year as adjusted to exclude the effects of non cash charges  a significant increase in inventory levels  decreases in accounts payable  and decreases in other liabilities primarily related to income taxes and variable cash compensation programs 
the increase in inventory was primarily due to increases in our field inventory to support the increased utilization of our light sources and increases in inventory related to our euv sources and silicon crystallization tools 
the decrease in accounts payable reflects the reduction in inventory purchases in the fourth quarter of due to the downturn in the global economy and semiconductor industry 
the changes in income tax liabilities were primarily due to significant tax payments made during these uses of cash were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in deferred revenue during the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily the result of collection efforts and lower accounts receivable balances 
the increase in deferred revenue primarily reflects advance payments received from asml for purchase orders under a multi year supply agreement for euv sources 
investment activities net cash used in investing activities in of million was due primarily to the timing of short term investments that matured and were reinvested during the period as well as capital expenditures primarily related to our euv research  development and productization efforts 
net cash used in investing activities in consisted primarily of million of purchases of short term and long term securities  net of reinvestment of such securities during the year 
in addition  cash used in investing activities included the acquisition of million of property  plant and equipment  a significant portion of which relates to equipment associated with our euv research  development and productization efforts  software and equipment purchases  and equipment purchases related to tcz 
net cash used in investing activities in consisted primarily of the acquisition of million of property  plant and equipment  a significant portion of which relates to building improvement costs and engineering equipment associated with our euv research  development and productization efforts 
this use of cash was offset by proceeds from sold or matured short term and long term securities  net of reinvestment of such securities during the year 
a portion of the proceeds from sold and matured investments during the year was used to fund our stock repurchase program 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities in primarily reflects the repurchase of million of our common stock and million for the purchase of the non controlling interest in tcz 
these uses of cash were partially offset by million received from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan and million of excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises 
net cash used in financing activities in primarily reflects the payment of million for the redemption of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes that matured on february  this payment was partially offset by proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under the 
table of contents employee stock purchase plan totaling million  an additional cash investment in tcz from zeiss  the former tcz minority shareholder  and excess tax benefits from stock option exercises 
net cash used in financing activities for primarily reflects the repurchase of million of our common stock 
this use of cash was partially offset by million in proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan and million additional cash investment in tcz from zeiss 
effect of exchange rate changes most of our foreign subsidiaries operate in currencies other than the us dollar  and the majority of their cash balances are denominated in these foreign currencies 
as a result  our cash and cash equivalent balances are subject to the effects of the fluctuations in these currencies against the us dollar at the end of each reporting period 
several of the foreign currencies in which our subsidiaries operate have experienced volatility over the past several years 
the net effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents  when expressed in us dollar terms  was an increase in cash of million for the year ended december   an increase of  for the year ended december   and a decrease of million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   cash and cash equivalents were positively affected by million due to the japanese yen strengthening against the us dollar and the effect it had on the cash balances held at our japanese subsidiary 
in addition  volatility of the korean won against the us dollar throughout the year positively affected cash and cash equivalents by  these increases were offset by  due to the weakening of the euro against the us dollar 
for the year ended december   the impact on cash was primarily due to the relationship of the korean won  the euro and the japanese yen against the us dollar 
specifically  cash and cash equivalents were positively affected by  due to the korean won and the euro strengthening against the us dollar and the effect it had on the cash balances denominated in these currencies held at our subsidiary offices 
this increase was offset by  due to the weakening of the japanese yen against the us dollar 
for the year ended december   we experienced significant volatility in the value of the korean won  and to a lesser extent  the euro  which resulted in a decrease of cash of million for the year ended december  not only did the korean won weaken dramatically against the us dollar in  but we had significant cash balances denominated in korean won as of december  as a result  cash and cash equivalents were negatively impacted by million due to the korean won weakening during the year 
this decrease was offset by the strengthening of the japanese yen against the us dollar and as a result  the cash and cash equivalents were positively impacted by million due to the japanese yen strengthening during the year 
prospective capital needs we require substantial resources to fund the operations of our business  particularly to fund our investment in new technologies  including inventory and capital in support of these technologies 
we expect purchases of property  plant and equipment in to be approximately million  a significant portion of which will relate to purchases of equipment and facility improvements associated with euv development and manufacturing  as well as purchases of software and equipment 
in addition  we require resources to fund our normal operations 
we believe that our operating cash flows  together with our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs for our normal operations  and our investments in our new technologies  including euv and silicon crystallization tools  for at least the next months 
it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities or to acquire assets  products or new technologies beyond the next months 
we may also decide that it is prudent in the current business and 
table of contents economic environment to secure commitments to access additional capital  including equity or debt securities  to protect our long term liquidity position 
in april  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
during  we purchased  shares for million under this program 
at december   million remain available under this program for repurchases 
our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned 
we anticipate that the amount of capital we will need in the future will depend on many factors  including the required investments in our new technologies such as euv and tcz silicon crystallization tools and in the products derived from them  the market acceptance of our products  the overall levels of sales of our products and gross profit margins  general economic and political conditions and specific conditions in the markets in which we operate  including the volatility in the semiconductor industry  and trends in the semiconductor markets in various geographic regions  including seasonality in sales of consumer products into which semiconductors are incorporated  the timing and requirements of spending to support product development efforts for our current technologies and other operating costs  our competitors responses to our products and our anticipation of and responses to their products  our manufacturing activity  the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain  the inability of certain of our customers who depend on credit to have access to their traditional sources of credit to finance the purchase of products from us  particularly during changing or adverse global economic conditions  which may lead them to reduce their level of purchases or to seek credit or other accommodations from us  competitive labor market compensation requirements  acquisitions of assets  products or new technologies  repurchases of our common stock  capital improvements for new and existing facilities  and our relationships with suppliers and customers 
transactions with related parties under our audit committee charter  our audit committee is responsible for reviewing and approving all related party transactions on a quarterly basis 
in addition  our board of directors determines annually whether any related party relationships exist among the directors which would interfere with the judgment of individual directors in carrying out his responsibilities as director 
during the year ended december   we engaged exponent  inc  to perform a one time component reliability analysis for a fee of  mr 
michael r 
gaulke  a member of our board of directors and member of exponent s board of directors  served as an executive officer of exponent until he retired from his executive chairman role on june  
table of contents contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years other purchase obligations operating leases other long term liabilities purchase obligations represent outstanding purchase commitments by us at december   including purchase orders that have cancellation provisions requiring little or no payment 
the amounts are included in the table above because management believes that cancellation of these purchase orders is unlikely and expects to make future cash payments according to the contractual terms or in similar amounts for similar materials 
other long term liabilities primarily represent liabilities for uncertain tax positions  deferred compensation and post retirement benefits related to our foreign pension plans 
the timing of payments resulting from uncertain tax positions will depend on a number of factors and we are unable to project if and when this might occur  if at all  within the next five years 
accordingly  we cannot make reasonable estimates of the amount and period of potential cash settlements  if any  with taxing authorities 
therefore  we have included million of long term income taxes payable in the column marked other 
the timing of payments of deferred compensation in the table above represents the current elections by participants  which are subject to change 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  variable interest  or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we did not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we do not have relationships with or enter into transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties except as disclosed herein 
recently issued accounting standards see note to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report for a description of recent accounting standards  including our expected dates of adoption and the estimated effects on our results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we conduct business in several international currencies through our global operations 
our foreign currency hedging program manages fluctuations in the value of the japanese yen  the korean won  the euro and the taiwanese dollar 
our foreign currency risk falls into two primary categories 
first  we are subject to uncertain gross profit margins when we forecast selling products in one currency and the product costs are denominated in a different currency  primarily for the purchases of our products by our 
table of contents japanese subsidiary in us dollars for resale under firm third party sales commitments denominated in japanese yen 
in this instance  we enter into derivative financial instruments  principally forward contracts  which we designate as cash flow hedges in order to mitigate fluctuations in the gross profit margins of these forecasted transactions 
forward contracts on forecasted transactions that hedge uncertain gross profit margins generally qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment 
gains and losses on cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the hedged transaction is recorded in the financial statements 
once the underlying transaction is recorded in the financial statements  we de designate the derivative  reclassify the accumulated gain or loss on the derivative into cost of revenues and cease to apply hedge accounting treatment 
once the derivative has been de designated  any further gains or losses are recorded to other income expense 
if all or a portion of the forecasted transaction were cancelled  this would render all or a portion of the cash flow hedge ineffective and we would reclassify the ineffective portion of the hedge into other income expense 
we generally have not experienced ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges from cancelled transactions 
the second category of foreign currency risk occurs when transactions are recorded to our consolidated financial statements in a currency other than the applicable entity s functional currency and the cash settlement of the transaction occurs at some point in the future 
when transactions in non functional currency are recorded to our consolidated financial statements  any changes in the recorded amounts resulting from fluctuations in the value of that currency will be recorded to other income expense 
in order to mitigate these revaluation gains and losses  we enter into derivative financial instruments  principally forward contracts 
the forward contracts that hedge transactions that have been recorded to our consolidated financial statements are not designated as hedges  and we record changes in their fair value to other income expense in order to attempt to offset gains and losses on the underlying transactions 
we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of for all currencies could be experienced in the near term 
these changes would have resulted in an adverse effect on income before income taxes of approximately  and million at december  and  respectively 
the adverse effect at december  and is after consideration of the offsetting effect of approximately million and million  respectively from forward exchange contracts in place at that time 
these reasonably possible adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates of were applied to net assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse effect these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term 
at december   we had outstanding forward contracts to buy million in exchange for japanese yen  million in exchange for korean won  million in exchange for taiwanese dollars and to sell million in exchange for euros 
these contracts expire on various dates through april the fair value of all our forward contracts totaled to a current liability of million at december  beginning in the fourth quarter of  sales to a significant customer in japan were changed  at the customer s request  to us dollars instead of japanese yen 
this change eliminated our need to enter into cash flow hedges and  therefore  we held no forward contracts that qualified for hedge accounting treatment as of december  we may enter into cash flow hedges in the future 
investment risk we maintain an investment portfolio consisting primarily of government and corporate fixed income securities  commercial paper and money market funds 
while it is our general intent to hold such securities until maturity  we will occasionally sell certain securities for cash flow purposes 
therefore  our investments are classified as available for sale and are carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
if interest rates were to increase instantaneously and uniformly by basis points  the fair market value of our investment portfolio as of december  would decrease by
