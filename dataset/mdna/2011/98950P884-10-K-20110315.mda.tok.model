item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we believe that we are the first company dedicated solely to developing the full spectrum of next generation access network solutions to cost effectively deliver high bandwidth services while simultaneously preserving the investment in today s networks 
our next generation solutions are based upon our slms architecture 
from its inception  this slms architecture was specifically designed for the delivery of multiple classes of subscriber services such as voice  data and video distribution  rather than being based on a particular protocol or media 
in other words  our slms products are built to support the migration from legacy circuit to packet technologies and from copper to fiber technologies 
this flexibility and versatility allows our products to adapt to future technologies while allowing service providers to focus on the delivery of additional high bandwidth services 
because this slms architecture is designed to interoperate with existing legacy equipment  service providers can leverage their existing networks to deliver a combination of voice  data and video services today  while they migrate  either simultaneously or at a future date  from legacy equipment to next generation equipment with minimal interruption 
we believe that our slms solution provides an evolutionary path for service providers from their existing infrastructures  as well as gives newer service providers the capability to deploy cost effective  multi service networks that can support voice  data and video 
our global customer base includes regional  national and international telecommunications carriers 
to date  our products are deployed by over network service providers on six continents worldwide 
we believe that we have assembled the employee base  technological breadth and market presence to provide a simple yet comprehensive set of next generation solutions to the bandwidth bottleneck in the access network and the other problems encountered by network service providers when delivering communications services to subscribers 
since inception  we have incurred significant operating losses and had an accumulated deficit of  million as of december  if we are unable to access or raise the capital needed to meet liquidity needs and finance capital expenditures and working capital  or if the economic  market and geopolitical conditions in the united states and the rest of the world do not improve or deteriorate  we may experience material adverse impacts on our business  operating results and financial condition 
during  we implemented several activities intended to reduce costs  improve operating efficiencies and change our operations to more closely align them with our key strategic focus  which included headcount reductions 
during  we continued to focus on cost control and operating efficiency along with restrictions on discretionary spending 
the most significant cost cutting measure during was the sale in september of our land and buildings located in oakland  california and extinguishment of related debt in a sale and leaseback transaction with lba realty  llc  or lba realty 
the sale and leaseback transaction will allow us to reduce occupancy costs going forward and improved the current financial position by eliminating the related debt which was due in april going forward  our key financial objectives include the following increasing revenue while continuing to carefully control costs  continued investments in strategic research and product development activities that will provide the maximum potential return on investment  and minimizing consumption of our cash and short term investments 
sale of legacy inventory and other assets in january  we sold our gigamux legacy product line to a third party 
the sale of the gigamux legacy product line was not treated as a discontinued operation since it did not represent a component of the company that had operations and cash flows that were clearly distinguishable  operationally and for financial reporting 
table of contents purposes  from the rest of the entity 
we allocated the proceeds received to receivables  inventory  fixed assets and intangible assets based on the relative fair value of the assets sold 
we recognized a gain of million on the sale of the inventory related to this product line in the first quarter of that was recorded in cost of revenue 
we also recognized a gain of million and million on the sale of fixed assets and intangible assets  respectively  in the first quarter of that was recorded as a component of operating expenses 
we are entitled to additional contingent consideration for the sale of the gigamux legacy product line upon the buyer s usage of inventory and or attainment of certain performance targets through december additional contingent consideration  if any  will be recorded upon receipt of cash as an additional gain in cost of revenue 
in and  we received additional contingent consideration of million and million  respectively  related to the buyer s usage of inventory related to the gigamux legacy product line 
we received no additional contingent consideration in related to the gigamux legacy product line 
in december  we sold inventory and certain assets related to our access node legacy product line to a third party 
the sale of the access node product line was not treated as a discontinued operation since it did not represent a component of our company that had operations and cash flows that were clearly distinguishable  operationally and for financial reporting purposes  from the rest of the entity 
upon sale of the access node inventory  we recognized a gain of million in that was recorded in cost of revenue 
in   and  we recognized additional gains of million  million  and million  respectively  which were recorded in cost of revenue 
we will continue to record additional gain in the future contingent upon attainment of certain earnout provisions 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because changes in such estimates can materially affect the amount of our reported net income or loss 
for all of these policies  management cautions that actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete 
we recognize product revenue upon shipment of product under contractual terms which transfer title to customers upon shipment  under normal credit terms  net of estimated sales returns and allowances at the time of shipment 
revenue is deferred if there are significant post delivery obligations or if the fees are not fixed or determinable 
when significant post delivery obligations exist  revenue is deferred until such obligations are fulfilled 
our arrangements generally do not have any significant post delivery obligations 
if our arrangements include customer acceptance provisions  revenue is recognized upon obtaining the signed acceptance certificate from the customer  unless we can objectively demonstrate that the delivered products or services meet all the acceptance criteria specified in the arrangement prior to obtaining the signed acceptance 
in those instances where revenue is recognized prior to obtaining the signed acceptance certificate  we use successful completion of customer testing as the basis to objectively demonstrate that the delivered products or services meet all the acceptance criteria specified in the arrangement 
we also consider our historical acceptance experience with the customer  as well as the payment terms specified in the arrangement  when revenue is recognized prior to obtaining the signed acceptance certificate 
we offer products and services such as support  education and training  hardware upgrades and post warranty support 
for multiple element revenue arrangements  we establish the fair value of these products and services based primarily on sales prices when the products and services are sold separately 
if fair value cannot be established for undelivered elements  all of the revenue under the arrangement is deferred until those elements have been delivered 
when collectibility is not reasonably assured  revenue is recognized when cash is collected 
revenue 
table of contents from education services and support services is recognized over the contract term or as the service is performed 
we make certain sales to product distributors 
these customers are given certain privileges to return a portion of inventory 
return privileges generally allow distributors to return inventory based on a percent of purchases made within a specific period of time 
we recognize revenue on sales to distributors that have contractual return rights when the products have been sold by the distributors  unless there is sufficient customer specific sales and sales returns history to support revenue recognition upon shipment 
in those instances when revenue is recognized upon shipment to distributors  we use historical rates of return from the distributors to provide for estimated product returns 
we accrue for warranty costs  sales returns and other allowances at the time of shipment based on historical experience and expected future costs 
allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts we record an allowance for sales returns for estimated future product returns related to current period product revenue 
the allowance for sales returns is recorded as a reduction of revenue and an allowance against our accounts receivable 
we base our allowance for sales returns on periodic assessments of historical trends in product return rates and current approved returned products 
if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established  our future revenue could be adversely affected 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make payments for amounts owed to us 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded as a charge to general and administrative expenses 
we base our allowance on periodic assessments of our customers liquidity and financial condition through analysis of information obtained from credit rating agencies  financial statement reviews and historical collection trends 
additional allowances may be required in the future if the liquidity or financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in impairment in their ability to make payments 
stock based compensation we estimate the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes pricing model  which is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
the expected stock price volatility is based on the weighted average of the historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock options 
we base our expected life assumption on our historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards we grant to employees 
risk free interest rates reflect the yield on zero coupon us treasury securities 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero 
if factors change  and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net loss and net loss per share 
we are also required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
in addition  stock based compensation expense was recorded for options issued to non employees 
these options are generally immediately exercisable and expire seven to ten years from the date of grant 
we value non employee options using the black scholes model 
non employee options subject to vesting are valued as they become vested 
in november  we completed the exchange offer to exchange certain stock options issued to eligible employees  officers and directors of zhone under zhone s equity incentive compensation plans 
the primary purpose of the exchange offer was to motivate  retain and reward talented employees and directors 
stock options previously granted that had an exercise price per share of equal to or greater than per share were 
table of contents eligible to be exchanged on a one for one basis for new stock options with an exercise price equal to the last reported sale price of zhone common stock on the nasdaq global market on the date of grant 
options for an aggregate of million shares of common stock were exchanged on november  the new stock options issued pursuant to the exchange offer have an exercise price of  vest over a four year period with no credit for past vesting and have a seven year term 
the exchange offer will result in incremental stock based compensation of approximately million to be recognized over the four year vesting period 
the remaining unrecognized compensation expense of the original grant will be amortized over the original requisite service period 
on march   our board of directors approved the acceleration of vesting of all unvested options to purchase shares of zhone common stock issued in connection with the exchange offer that were held by members of zhone s senior management 
the acceleration was effective as of march  options to purchase an aggregate of approximately million shares of zhone common stock were subject to the acceleration and resulted in a compensation charge of million which was fully expensed on march  the acceleration of these options was undertaken in recognition of the achievement of certain performance objectives by zhone s senior management 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
in assessing the net realizable value of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare these with the current or committed inventory levels 
once inventory has been written down to its estimated net realizable value  its carrying value cannot be increased due to subsequent changes in demand forecasts 
to the extent that a severe decline in forecasted demand occurs  or we experience a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we may incur significant charges for excess inventory 
operating lease liabilities as a result of our acquisition of paradyne in september  we assumed certain lease liabilities for facilities in largo  florida 
we have accrued a liability for the excess portion of these facilities 
the computation of the estimated liability includes a number of assumptions and subjective variables 
these variables include the level and timing of future sublease income  amount of contractual variable costs  future market rental rates  discount rate  and other estimated expenses 
if circumstances change  and we employ different assumptions in future periods  the lease liability may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our net loss and net loss per share 
during the second quarter of  we increased the excess lease liability balance by million with a corresponding charge to general and administrative expenses 
during  we assumed that we would no longer be able to sublease the remaining excess space due to the continued deterioration in the real estate market 
accordingly  during  we increased our excess lease liability balance by million  with a corresponding charge to general and administrative expenses

at december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million compared to million at december  this amount included cash and cash equivalents of million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million was attributable to net cash used in investing activities and financing activities of million and million  respectively  offset by net cash provided by operating activities of million 
operating activities for fiscal year  net cash provided by operating activities consisted of a net loss of million  adjusted for non cash charges totaling million and a decrease in operating assets totaling million 
the most significant components of the changes in net operating assets were a decrease in accounts receivable of million partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of million

table of contents significant components of the changes in net operating assets were an increase in accounts receivable of million offset by a decrease in inventories of million

as part of our september sale and leaseback transaction with lba realty  we moved into another building at the oakland location and performed significant build out of new labs and redesigned office spaces resulting in an increase in property and equipment purchases as compared to for fiscal year  net cash provided by investing activities consisted primarily of proceeds from the sale and maturity of short term investments of million offset by purchases of short term investments of million and equipment purchases of million 
financing activities for fiscal year  net cash used in financing activities consisted of repayment of the secured real estate debt of million for the period before the sale of the oakland  california campus and extinguishment of the related debt transaction as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
this was partially offset by the proceeds related to exercise of stock options and purchases made under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp of million 
for fiscal year  net cash used in financing activities consisted primarily of repayment of the debt and credit facility of million primarily in connection with the replacement of our existing revolving line of credit and letter of credit facility with svb with a new revolving line of credit and letter of credit in march cash management our primary source of liquidity comes from our cash and cash equivalents  which totaled million at december   and our million svb facility 
our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts 
at current revenue levels  we anticipate that some portion of our existing cash and cash equivalents will continue to be consumed by operations 
under the svb facility  we have the option of borrowing funds at agreed upon interest rates 
the amount that we are able to borrow under the svb facility varies based on the eligible accounts receivable  as defined in the agreement  as long as the principal amount outstanding does not exceed million 
in addition  under the svb facility  we are able to utilize the facility as security for letters of credit 
under the svb facility  million was outstanding at december  in addition  million was committed as security for various letters of credit and million was unused and available for borrowing as of december  as of december   the amounts borrowed under the svb facility bore interest  payable monthly  at a floating rate that was svb s prime rate plus  with a minimum interest rate of 
the interest rate was at december  our obligations under the svb facility are secured by substantially all of our personal property assets and those of our subsidiaries  including our intellectual property 
the svb facility contains certain financial 
table of contents covenants  and customary affirmative covenants and negative covenants 
if we do not comply with the various covenants and other requirements under the svb facility  svb is entitled to  among other things  require the immediate repayment of all outstanding amounts and sell our assets to satisfy the obligations under the svb facility 
as of december   we were not in compliance with the financial covenant regarding minimum ebitda under the svb facility 
on january   we entered into an amendment with svb in which svb agreed to waive our obligation to comply with the financial covenant regarding minimum ebitda for the compliance period ending december  in january  we repaid the million outstanding under the svb facility 
on march   we renewed the svb facility to provide liquidity and working capital through march  and amended the interest rate applicable to amounts borrowed under the svb facility  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
future requirements and funding sources our fixed commitments for cash expenditures consist primarily of payments under operating leases  inventory purchase commitments  and payments of principal and interest for debt obligations 
as a result of the paradyne acquisition in  we assumed a lease commitment for facilities in largo  florida 
the term of the lease expires in june and had an estimated remaining obligation of approximately million as of december  we intend to continue to occupy only a portion of these facilities and are evaluating our options to exit the excess portion of the lease 
we have recorded a liability of million as of december   which we believe is adequate to cover costs incurred to exit the excess portion of these facilities  net of estimated sublease income 
our operating lease commitments also include million of future minimum lease payments spread over the five year lease term under the lease agreement we entered into with lba realty in september with respect to our oakland  california campus following the sale of our campus to lba realty in a sale leaseback transaction 
as a result of the financial demands of major network deployments and the difficulty in accessing capital markets  network service providers continue to request financing assistance from their suppliers 
from time to time  we may provide or commit to extend credit or credit support to our customers 
this financing may include extending the terms for product payments to customers 
depending upon market conditions  we may seek to factor these arrangements to financial institutions and investors to reduce the amount of our financial commitments associated with such arrangements 
for example  during the year ended december   we sold million of customer trade receivables to svb on a non recourse basis in exchange for cash 
the sale of the receivables did not represent a securitization  and there was no continuing involvement or interests in the receivables by us after the sale 
our ability to provide customer financing is limited and depends upon a number of factors  including our capital structure  the level of our available credit and our ability to factor commitments to third parties 
any extension of financing to our customers will limit the capital that we have available for other uses 
our accounts receivable  while not considered a primary source of liquidity  represent a concentration of credit risk because a significant portion of the accounts receivable balance at any point in time typically consists of large balances due from a relatively small number of customer account balances 
as of december   etisalat accounted for of net accounts receivable  and receivables from customers in countries other than the united states of america represented of net accounts receivable 
we do not currently have any material commitments for capital expenditures  or any other material commitments aside from operating leases for our facilities  inventory purchase commitments and debt 
we expect that operating losses and negative cash flows from operations may continue 
in order to meet our liquidity needs and finance our capital expenditures and working capital needs for our business  we may be required to sell assets  issue debt or equity securities or borrow on unfavorable terms 
continued uncertainty regarding financial institutions ability and inclination to lend may negatively impact our ability to access debt 
table of contents financing or to refinance existing indebtedness in the future on favorable terms  or at all 
we may be unable to sell assets  issue securities or access additional indebtedness to meet these needs on favorable terms  or at all 
if additional capital is raised through the issuance of debt securities or other debt financing  the terms of such debt may include covenants  restrictions and financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
likewise  any equity financing could result in additional dilution of our stockholders 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital or are required to obtain additional capital on terms that are not favorable to us  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and sales and marketing efforts beyond the reductions we have previously taken 
based on our current plans and business conditions  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and available credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
contractual commitments and off balance sheet arrangements at december   our future contractual commitments by fiscal year were as follows in thousands payments due by period total and thereafter operating leases purchase commitments line of credit total future contractual commitments operating leases the operating lease amounts shown above represent primarily off balance sheet arrangements 
for operating lease commitments  a liability is generally not recorded on our balance sheet unless the facility represents an excess facility for which an estimate of the facility exit costs has been recorded on our balance sheet  net of estimated sublease income 
for operating leases that include contractual commitments for operating expenses and maintenance  estimates of such amounts are included based on current rates 
payments made under operating leases will be treated as rent expense for the facilities currently being utilized 
of the total million operating lease amount  million has been recorded as a liability on our balance sheet as of december  purchase commitments the purchase commitments shown above represent non cancellable inventory purchase commitments as of december  the inventory purchase commitments typically allow for cancellation of orders days in advance of the required inventory availability date as set by us at time of order 
line of credit the line of credit obligation has been recorded as a liability on our balance sheet 
the line of credit obligation amount shown above represents the scheduled principal repayment under our svb facility  but not the associated interest payments which may vary based on changes in market interest rates 
at december   the interest rate under our svb facility was 
as of december   we had million outstanding under the svb facility and an additional million committed as security for various letters of credit  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents sale leaseback of oakland  california campus on september   we sold our oakland  california campus  consisting of land and three buildings  to lba realty for approximately million 
as part of the sale transaction  lba realty agreed to settle our secured real estate debt which was secured by the oakland  california campus for a net sum of million 
in connection with the sale  we entered into a multi tenant commercial industrial lease agreement  or the lease agreement  to rent one of the buildings from lba realty for a five year term  commencing from the closing of the sale 
the initial annual rent under the lease agreement is approximately million  with periodic rent escalations at a rate of approximately per annum 
under the lease agreement  in october  we also received a non refundable tenant improvement allowance of million for the required alterations to the property being leased back 
the tenant improvement allowance amount will be amortized over the term of the lease as an offset to rent expense 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standards update asu  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
as summarized in asu  asc topic has been amended to provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated  and the consideration allocated  to require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or third party evidence of selling price  and to eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
the accounting changes summarized in asu are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
adoption may either be on a prospective basis or by retrospective application 
we have assessed the impact of this amendment to the asc on our accounting and reporting systems and processes  and do not anticipate the adoption to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in january  fasb issued asu  fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
the update requires new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements including significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements
