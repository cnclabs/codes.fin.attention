we incur routine drydock  inspection  maintenance and repair costs pursuant to us coast guard regulations and in order to maintain our vessels in class under the rules of the applicable class society 
for  these costs were million 
we defer these costs and amortize them over the period commencing with the date the vessel returned to service following completion of the drydock and certification process to the next certificate expiry date  which typically ranges from months to months 
these costs can fluctuate widely from year to year based on the number of vessels  the scope of the related work plan  availability of drydock capacity and general prevailing market conditions 
in addition to complying with these requirements  we have our own vessel maintenance program that we believe permits us to continue to provide our customers with well maintained  reliable vessels 
in addition to the deferred drydock costs discussed above  during  we incurred million in capital expenditures primarily related to replacements and vessel improvements 
in the normal course of business  we charter other vessels on a short term basis  such as tugboats  cargo barges  utility boats and dive support vessels

table of contents item legal proceedings insurance and legal proceedings our operations are subject to the inherent risks of offshore marine activity  including accidents resulting in personal injury and the loss of life or property  environmental mishaps  mechanical failures  fires and collisions 
we insure against these risks at levels consistent with industry standards 
we also carry workers compensation  maritime employer s liability  general liability and other insurance customary in our business 
all insurance is carried at levels of coverage and deductibles we consider financially prudent 
our services are provided in hazardous environments where accidents involving catastrophic damage or loss of life could occur  and litigation arising from such events may result in our being named a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims 
although there can be no assurance the amounts of insurance we carry are sufficient to protect us fully in all events  or that such insurance will continue to be available at current levels of cost or coverage  we believe that our insurance protection is adequate for our business operations 
a successful liability claim for which we are underinsured or uninsured could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we are involved in various legal proceedings  primarily involving claims for personal injury under the general maritime laws of the united states and the jones act as a result of alleged negligence 
in addition  we from time to time incur other claims  such as contract disputes  in the normal course of business 
under our agreements with helix  we have assumed and agreed to indemnify helix for liabilities related to our business 
tax assessment during the fourth quarter of  horizon received a tax assessment related to fiscal from the servicio de administracion tributaria sat  the mexican taxing authority  for approximately million pesos  translated to approximately million using the foreign exchange rate at december   including penalties and interest 
the sat s assessment claims unpaid taxes related to services performed among our subsidiaries as well as penalties and accrued interest 
we have consulted with our mexican counsel and believe that under the mexico and united states double taxation treaty these services are not taxable and the tax assessment itself is invalid 
accordingly  we have not recorded a liability for the sat s assessment for the tax year in our consolidated financial statements 
on february   we received notice from the sat upholding the original assessment 
on april   we filed a petition in mexico tax court disputing the assessment 
we believe that our position is supported by law and intend to vigorously defend our position 
all pleadings have been filed and we are awaiting the court s decision 
however  the ultimate timing and outcome of this litigation and our potential liability from this assessment  if any  cannot be determined at this time 
nonetheless  an unfavorable outcome with respect to the mexico tax assessment could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
the sat also claimed unpaid taxes related to services performed among our subsidiaries for horizon s through taxable years 
during  we successfully completed negotiations with the sat with respect to their claim of unpaid taxes related to horizon s through taxable years  and paid an aggregate of approximately million in settlement of these periods 
horizon s through tax audits were closed in  settling this particular claim by the sat 
in we also filed amendments for tax years through using the same methodology used in the settlement for the through years 
the amended returns were accepted by the mexican tax authority in march  effectively settling this particular claim 
even though we have settled this issue for these years  under mexican tax law there is a five year statute of limitations  so our tax years through remain open for examination in this jurisdiction

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and their notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  such as those set forth under item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
business and outlook we experienced challenging market conditions in that we expect to continue in as a result of the continued negative effects stemming from the global recession that began in and the april macondo well disaster 
our results were also affected by the following additional factors reduced new construction work worldwide  fewer large projects utilizing multiple vessels occurring in similar to projects completed in and which yielded significant profits  reduced levels of hurricane repair and salvage work in the gulf of mexico  and heightened competition in certain of our international strategic markets due to new capacity placed into service 
the macondo well disaster has significantly and adversely disrupted oil and gas exploration activities in the gulf of mexico and there is increased uncertainty in the market and regulatory environment for our industry which will likely have a negative effect on our customer s spending levels for some time 
the duration that this disruption will continue is currently unknown 
we believe these uncertain market conditions contributed to the decline in our stock price and our market capitalization relative to our equity book value during in the third quarter of  the continued decline in our stock price and uncertainty described above prompted us to conclude that a triggering event had occurred that required us to perform an interim impairment test  which resulted in our recording million of pre tax impairment expenses million of pre tax goodwill impairment expense and million of pre tax fixed assets impairment expense 
generally  we believe the long term outlook for our business remains favorable in both domestic and international markets as capital spending will increase to support exploration and development activity necessary to replenish oil and natural gas production  and for industry participants to satisfy new idle iron regulations and other directives promulgated by boemre regarding the decommissioning of platforms and pipelines 
we expect all of these factors to continue to drive long term demand for our services 
fiscal performance we generated a net loss of million per diluted share for the year ended december  primarily as a result of non cash  pre tax impairment charges recorded during the third quarter related to goodwill and four idle construction barges 
this compares to net income of million  or per share  for the year ended december  our performance compared to was also adversely affected by lower vessel utilization  which was in declining to in this continuing prolonged decline in vessel utilization is primarily a result of decreased demand for new construction services worldwide and a decrease in demand for hurricane repair and salvage work 
in addition  we experienced lower day rates across our diving fleet during as well as unexpected mechanical downtime for one of our dp saturation diving vessels in the third quarter of work relating to cleanup efforts for the oil spill as a result of the macondo well blowout partially offset these factors 

table of contents vessel utilization we believe vessel utilization is one of the most important performance measurements for our business 
utilization provides a good indication of demand for our vessels and  as a result  the contract rates we may charge for our services 
as a marine contractor with significant operations in the gulf of mexico  our vessel utilization is typically lower during the winter and early spring due to unfavorable weather conditions in the gulf of mexico 
accordingly  we attempt to schedule our drydock inspections and other routine and preventative maintenance programs during this period 
the bid and award process during the first two quarters typically leads to the commencement of construction activities during the second and third quarters 
the seasonal trend for vessel utilization can be disrupted by hurricanes  which can cause severe offshore damage and generate significant demand for our services from oil and natural gas companies trying to restore shut in production 
this production restoration focus has led to increased demand for our services for prolonged periods following hurricanes  as was the case in the first half of following hurricanes gustav and ike in beginning in the fourth quarter of  and reflected in our results for the year ended december   our operations on the gulf of mexico ocs returned to more customary seasonal conditions  the effect of which was further exacerbated by particularly weak demand for our services during the first half of these factors resulted in a decrease in vessel utilization across our entire fleet for the fiscal year ended december  as compared to fiscal the following table shows the size of our fleet and effective utilization of our vessels during the past three fiscal years number of vessels utilization number of vessels utilization number of vessels utilization saturation diving surface and mixed gas diving construction barges entire fleet effective vessel utilization is calculated by dividing the total number of days the vessels generated revenues by the total number of days the vessels were available for operation in each year 
results of operations operating results year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands in thousands  except revenues gross profit vessel utilization revenues decreased from to by million  or  and gross profit decreased by million or  due to lower vessel utilization  which declined from in to in the decreases in revenues and gross profit in as compared to were primarily a result of i fewer substantial integrated construction projects as compared to a liquefied natural gas project located offshore boston and two significant pipelay projects in china and mexico which were ongoing in that utilized multiple vessels and yielded significant profits  ii decreased demand for hurricane related repair work and salvage activity as compared to the increased activity experienced during as a result of hurricanes gustav and ike that passed through the gulf of mexico in the third quarter of and iii significantly lower day rates 

table of contents revenues decreased from to by million  or  and gross profit decreased by million or 
the decreases in revenues and gross profit in as compared to were primarily a result of lower vessel utilization resulting from a decreased new construction services  which declined from in to in our decline in vessel utilization was partially offset by an increase in demand for hurricane related repair and salvage work resulting from hurricanes gustav and ike 
goodwill impairment year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands in thousands  except goodwill impairment during we incurred million of goodwill impairment charges following a significant and continued decline in our stock prices and related market capitalization and a challenging business climate 
there were no comparable impairment charges during the same period of fixed assets impairment year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands in thousands  except fixed assets impairment during we incurred million of impairment charges related to certain fixed assets  consisting of four idle construction barges  for which the outlook for utilization remains uncertain 
there were no comparable impairment charges during the same period of selling and administrative expenses year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands in thousands  except selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues selling and administrative expenses decreased from to by million  or 
the decreases were primarily due to lower incentive cash compensation in  cost control measures initiated by management in the fourth quarter of in response to the downturn in business activity  and lower amortization expense for certain intangible assets recognized as part of the horizon acquisition  which became fully amortized in the second quarter of selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  increased from the same period ended december  due to the decrease in revenues as described above 
provision for doubtful accounts year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands provision for doubtful accounts the provision for doubtful accounts recorded during was comprised of million reserved for customers that filed for bankruptcy protection during the year and million for contract disputes with customers 
we intend to pursue all commercial and legal avenues for collection of the receivables currently reserved for in our allowance for doubtful accounts 

table of contents gains on sales and other expense  net year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands gain on sale of assets other expense  net in  we sold a portable saturation system to a third party for cash proceeds totaling million and recognized a gain on the sale of million  and we sold two utility vessels to different third parties for million and recognized a gain on the sales of million 
other income expense is primarily from foreign currency gains and losses on transactions conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
in addition  we recorded an impairment charge of million during for abandonment of buildings and leasehold improvements 
interest expense  net year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands interest expense  net the decrease in interest expense  net from to and from to is primarily due to lower outstanding borrowings 
our debt level under our credit facility was million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
income tax expense benefit year ended december  increase decrease to to income tax expense benefit including goodwill and fixed asset impairment charges effect of the goodwill and fixed asset impairment charges income tax expense benefit excluding goodwill and fixed asset impairment charges percentage is not meaningful 
our effective tax rate was   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
because we generated a pre tax loss for the year ended december   the lower effective tax rate results in a lower tax benefit realized 
the change in our effective tax rate during the year ended december  compared to and was primarily due to the impairment charges related to non deductible goodwill  which decreased our current year effective tax rate by 
net income loss year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands net income loss weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding fully diluted earnings loss per share 
table of contents as a result of the factors described above  i net income decreased from a net income of million in to a net loss of million in  and fully diluted earnings per share decreased from earnings per share of in to a loss per share of in  and ii net income decreased from to by million  or  and fully diluted earnings per share decreased by per share  or 
partially offsetting the decrease in fully diluted earnings per share in was a reduction in weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding from to  primarily as a result of the repurchase from helix and retirement of million shares of our common stock during liquidity and capital resources we require capital to fund ongoing operations  organic growth initiatives and pursue joint ventures or acquisitions 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations  available cash and cash equivalents and availability under our revolving credit facility 
we use  and intend to continue using  these sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements  maintenance capital expenditures  strategic investments and acquisitions 
for  we anticipate capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions or investments in joint ventures  of approximately million for vessel improvements and replacements  and million of regulatory drydock costs 
in connection with our business strategy  we regularly evaluate acquisition and joint venture opportunities  including vessels and marine contracting businesses 
we believe that our liquidity will provide the necessary capital to fund our business activities and achieve our near term and long term growth objectives 
we expect to be able to fund our activities for with cash flows generated from our operations  available cash and cash equivalents  and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we have a credit facility  which consists of a variable interest term loan and a variable interest million revolving credit facility  with certain financial institutions 
at december   we had outstanding debt of million under our term loan  including current maturities  and no debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility and the term loan mature on december   with quarterly principal payments of million payable on the term loan and a final payment of million due on maturity 
we may prepay all or any portion of the outstanding balance of the term loan without prepayment penalty 
we may borrow from or repay the revolving credit facility as business needs merit 
at december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants under our facility 
as of december   we had million of cash on hand  million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility  issued and outstanding letters of credit of million under our revolving credit facility  and no outstanding warranty bonds 
effective july   we amended the credit facility to  among other things  i increase our permitted consolidated leverage ratio covenant  ii amend the amortization of a portion of our term loan  and iii permit us to transfer in the future two of our saturation diving vessels operating internationally the eclipse and the texas to one of our international subsidiaries and to release such vessels as collateral upon any such future transfer in december we completed the transfer of the eclipse as permitted by the terms of the amendment 
under the amendment  our permitted debt to ebitda leverage ratio was increased from x to x for the period through june   decreasing to x through september   and thereafter returning to x 
in addition  the amortization of a portion of the debt outstanding under the term loan was deferred until the maturity date  reducing our quarterly principal payments on the term loan from million to million  with a final payment of million due on december  our current blended total interest rate for the term loan at december  is approximately 
although we were in full compliance with the leverage ratio covenant  and anticipated continued compliance in the future  we took the proactive measure to secure the amendment to enhance our access to cash and liquidity in the future 
the impairment charges related to goodwill and the four idle construction barges have no effect on our debt covenants under our credit facility 
based on our consolidated leverage ratio and outstanding borrowings and letters of credit as of december   we have million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility 

table of contents cash flows our cash flows depend on the level of spending by oil and natural gas companies for marine contracting services 
certain sources and uses of cash  such as the level of discretionary capital expenditures  issuance and repurchases of debt and of our common stock  are within our control and are adjusted as necessary based on market conditions 
the following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended december  and operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million during compared to million during during  net income adjusted for net non cash items  such as depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation and deferred income taxes  provided million of cash  and net changes in our working capital and other balance sheet accounts used million of cash

net cash used for financing activities was million during compared to million in during  we borrowed million under our revolving credit facility to meet working capital needs 
we made scheduled payments of million under our term loan and re paid the entire million outstanding under our revolving credit facility  which resulted in no amounts being outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of december  during  we borrowed million under our revolving credit facility to fund the million repurchase of our common stock from helix 
we made scheduled payments of million under our term loan and re paid the million outstanding under our revolving credit facility  which resulted in no amounts being outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of december  contractual and other obligations we lease several facilities worldwide and accommodations for certain employees located outside the us under noncancelable operating leases

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
for information regarding our principles of consolidation  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates and policies our accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
our results of operations and financial condition  as reflected in our consolidated financial statements and related notes  are subject to management s evaluation and interpretation of business conditions  changing capital market conditions and other factors that could affect the ongoing viability of our business and our customers 
we believe the most critical accounting policies in this regard are those described below 
while these issues require us to make judgments that are somewhat subjective  they are generally based on a significant amount of historical data and current market data 
revenue recognition we determine the appropriate revenue recognition accounting method for each of our contracts at the beginning of the project 
most of our revenues are derived from contracts that have a short duration 
these contracts contain either qualified lump sum provisions or provisions for specific time  material and equipment charges  which we bill in accordance with the terms of such contracts 
revenue generated from qualified lump sum contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
changes in the expected cost of materials and labor  productivity  scheduling and other factors may affect the total estimated costs 
additionally  external factors  including weather or other factors outside of our control  may also affect the progress and estimated cost of a project s completion and  therefore  delay the timing of income and revenue recognition 
we routinely review estimates related to our contracts and reflect revisions to profitability in earnings on a current basis 
if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates an ultimate loss on a contract  we recognize the projected loss in full when it is first determined as required under generally accepted accounting principles 
we recognize additional contract revenue related to claims when the claim is probable and legally enforceable 
in determining whether a contract should be accounted for using the percentage of completion method  we follow the accounting guidelines for the performance of construction type contracts 
the use of this method is based on our experience and history of being able to prepare reasonably dependable estimates of the cost to complete our projects 
although we constantly seek to improve our ability to estimate revenue  contract costs and profitability  adjustments to total contract costs due to unanticipated events could be significant in future periods 
revenues generated from specific time  materials and equipment contracts are generally earned on a dayrate basis and recognized as delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
property and equipment we record our property and equipment at cost  net of recorded impairments 
we depreciate our assets primarily on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
our estimates of useful lives of our assets are as follows vessels to years  portable saturation diving systems ten to years  machinery and equipment five to ten years  and buildings and leasehold improvements three to years 
major replacements and improvements  which extend the vessel s economic useful life or functional operating capability  are capitalized and depreciated over their economic useful lives 
we expense the costs of repairs and maintenance which do not materially prolong the useful life of the property and equipment as incurred 
inherent in this process are estimates we make regarding the specific cost incurred and the period that the incurred cost will benefit 

table of contents we evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of our property and equipment may not be recoverable 
we base our evaluation on impairment indicators such as the nature of the assets  the future economic benefit of the assets  any historical or future profitability measurements and other external market conditions 
if such impairment indicators are present  we determine whether an impairment has occurred through projected net undiscounted cash flows based on expected operating results over the remaining life of the asset group 
the cash flows are based on historical data adjusted for management estimates of future market performance that rely on existing market data  industry trends  expected utilization and margins 
management s estimates may vary considerably from actual outcomes due to future adverse market conditions  poor operating results  or other factors that could result in our inability to recover the current carrying value of long lived assets  which could possibly require an impairment charge in the future 
we recorded million of impairment charges related to certain fixed assets  consisting of four idle construction barges for which the outlook for future utilization is uncertain 
we recorded an impairment charge of million in for buildings and leasehold improvements we have abandoned 
recertification costs and deferred drydock costs our vessels are required by regulation to be recertified after certain periods of time 
typically  these recertification costs are incurred while the vessel is in drydock 
we defer these costs and amortize them over the period commencing with the date the vessel returned to service following completion of the drydock process to the next certificate expiry date  which typically ranges from months to months 
a drydock and related recertification process typically lasts one to two months  a period during which the vessel is not available to earn revenue 
inherent in this process are estimates we make regarding the specific cost incurred and the period that the incurred cost will benefit 
goodwill and fixed asset impairments under accounting standards codification asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other and asc topic  property  plant and equipment  we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and long lived assets 
we elected november st as our annual impairment assessment date for goodwill and other intangible assets 
in certain circumstances  we also test for impairment of goodwill between annual tests if a triggering event occurs  such as significant adverse change in the business climate  unexpected significant declines in operating results  an adverse action by a regulator  emergence of unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel or a decline in market capitalization 
our goodwill impairment test is based on our single operating and reporting unit and involves a comparison of the fair value of the unit with its carrying amount 
the fair value is determined using market related valuation models and discounted cash flows 
during the third quarter of  our market capitalization declined by approximately from million at june  to million at august   which was lower by million  or  than our equity book value at august  the macondo well disaster has significantly and adversely disrupted oil and gas exploration activities in the gulf of mexico and there is increased uncertainty in the market and regulatory environment for our industry which has had a negative effect on our customer s spending levels 
the duration of this disruption is currently unknown and this has negatively impacted the outlook for activity levels in the gulf of mexico 
in light of the continued decline in our stock price and market capitalization and challenging and uncertain business climate during  management determined that a triggering event had occurred necessitating the performance of an interim impairment test 
as a result  we commenced an interim assessment of our goodwill  which we completed as of august  goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
in the first step  if the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
however  if the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the process is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss to recognize  if any 

table of contents under the first step of the process  we estimated the fair value of our reporting unit using both a market related and discounted cash flow valuation approach 
under the market related approach  the fair value of our reporting unit is calculated by applying an average peer total invested capital to ebitda defined as earnings before interest  income taxes and depreciation and amortization multiple to forecasted ebitda for the reporting unit 
we exercise our judgment in selecting peer companies that operate in the same or similar lines of business as ours and are potentially subject to similar market risks 
under the income approach  a discounted cash flow analysis is performed requiring us to make various assumptions about our discount rate  future revenue  operating margins  capital expenditures and growth rates 
these assumptions are based on historical operating results  long term business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data 
these fair value measurements fall within level under asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures 
the second step of the process compared the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
to the extent that our reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination  through allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities  including any unrecognized intangible assets  as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
based on the first step calculation of our goodwill impairment test  the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeded its fair value  which required us to perform the second step of the impairment test 
in the second step  the fair value of goodwill and fixed assets was generally estimated using an income valuation approach 
based on our goodwill impairment analysis  we recorded million of pre tax goodwill impairment expense 
income taxes in accordance with asc topic  income taxes  we recognize income tax expense for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
the current provision for income tax is based upon the current tax laws and our interpretation of these laws  as well as the probable outcomes of any foreign or domestic tax audits 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all of the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we compute deferred income taxes using the liability method 
we provide for deferred income taxes on all temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities by applying enacted statutory tax rates  applicable to future years 
allowable tax credits are applied currently as reductions to the provisions for income taxes 
our most significant judgments on tax related matters include tax valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions 
these matters involve the exercise of significant judgment which could change and materially impact our financial condition or results of operations 
the realization of our deferred tax assets depends on recognition of sufficient future taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions during periods in which those temporary differences are deductible 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts we believe are more likely than not to be recovered 
in evaluating our valuation allowance  we consider the reversal of existing temporary differences  the existence of taxable income in prior carryback years  tax planning strategies and future taxable income for each of our taxable jurisdictions  the latter two of which involve the exercise of significant judgment 
changes to our valuation allowance could materially impact our results of operations 
we have liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions connected with ongoing examinations and open tax years 
changes in our assessment of these liabilities may require us to increase the liability and record additional tax expense or reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit which would positively or negatively impact our effective tax rate 
we do not provide for us income taxes on foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings intended to be permanently reinvested in foreign operations 
for financial reporting purposes  our provision for income taxes has been computed on the basis that we have completed and filed separate federal income tax returns for all periods presented 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve 
allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible  including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices  customer satisfaction claims and pricing discrepancies 
depending on how these issues are resolved  or if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  adjustments to the allowance may be required 

table of contents loss contingencies we accrue loss contingency reserves when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of our liabilities are based on an evaluation of potential outcomes and currently available facts 
we attempt to resolve these matters through settlements  mediation and arbitration proceedings when possible 
actual results may differ from our estimates  and our estimates can be revised in the future  either negatively or positively  depending upon actual outcomes or changes in expectations based on the facts surrounding each matter 
recently issued accounting principles each reporting period we consider all newly issued but not yet adopted accounting and reporting guidance applicable to our operations and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we do not believe that any issued accounting and reporting guidance we have not yet adopted will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks in our normal business activities 
market risk is the potential loss that may result from market changes associated with existing or forecasted financial transactions 
the types of market risks to which we are exposed are credit risk  interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
credit risk 
our financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and accounts receivable 
cash equivalents such as deposits and temporary cash investments are held by major banks 
our trade receivables are with a variety of us  international and foreign country national oil and natural gas companies 
management considers this credit risk to be limited due to the financial resources of these companies 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and we generally do not require material collateral to support contractual payment obligations 
we maintain reserves for potential credit losses 
interest rate risk 
at december   we had million of variable rate debt outstanding under our credit facility 
changes based on the floating interest rates under this facility could result in an increase or decrease in our annual interest expense and related cash outlay 
to reduce the impact of this market risk  in august we entered into a twelve month interest rate swap with a notional amount of million to convert a portion of our anticipated variable rate interest payments under our term loan to fixed rate interest payments 
we expect this interest rate swap to effectively fix our variable interest payments made on million of our term loan  at plus the current average applicable loan margin of approximately for a total interest rate of for the remaining term of the interest rate hedge 
a hypothetical increase of in quoted interest rates as of december  would increase interest expense by million and million in and  respectively 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we have operations in foreign locations that subject us to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
although the vast majority of our business is transacted in us dollars  we transact some business in euro dollars  mexican pesos  singapore dollars  and australian dollars  among others 
historically  foreign currency exchange rate risk has not been material to our business and we have not entered into any foreign exchange contracts 
at various times  we utilize the payment structure of customer contracts to selectively hedge our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in connection with monetary assets  liabilities  cash flows and commitments denominated in certain foreign currencies 
as we continue to grow our international operations  foreign currency exchange rate risk may become more significant and we may mitigate our foreign currency risk with foreign currency derivative instruments in the future
