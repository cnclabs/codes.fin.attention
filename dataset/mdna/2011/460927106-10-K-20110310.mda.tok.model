item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general this section presents discussion and analysis of our financial condition at december  and  and our results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december  this section should be read in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated financial statements in this report 
for a detailed discussion of our business  see item business in this report 
critical accounting policies general 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the information included in management s discussion and analysis is governed by policies that are based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and general practices within the banking industry 
the financial information contained in our financial statements is  to a significant extent  based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it is important to a company s results of operations and financial condition  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain amounts reported in the financial statements and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions used in connection with the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures are reasonable and made in good faith 

table of contents we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that relate to the determination of the following our allowance for loan losses  our valuation allowance for real estate losses  other than temporary impairment assessments of our security investments  and the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for our deferred tax asset 
these items are considered critical accounting estimates because each is highly susceptible to change from period to period and require us to make numerous assumptions about a variety of information that directly affect the calculation of the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
for example  the impact of a large unexpected chargeoff could deplete the allowance for loan losses and potentially require us to record increased loan loss provisions to replenish the allowance  which could negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 
for a summary of our other significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements in this report 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses reflects our judgment as to the estimated credit losses that may result from defaults in our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a loan loss provision charged to expense 
loans are charged off against the allowance when we believe that the collection of any portion of the principal amount of the loan balance is confirmed as a loss 
subsequent recoveries of previous chargeoffs are added back to the allowance 
we evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses at least quarterly or more frequently when necessary 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires us to make estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
the allowance consists of specific and general components 
for loans that are not impaired  the general component of the allowance is based on a number of factors 
we begin with our actual historical loss experience by major loan category expressed as a percentage of outstanding loans 
because actual loss experience may not adequately predict the level of losses inherent in a portfolio  we then review other qualitative factors to determine if our historical loss rate should be increased or decreased based upon a review of those factors 
our evaluation considers the following qualitative factors 
i size of our loans 
our loan portfolio has many individual loans with large principal balances 
at december   the average real estate loan was million  with the largest loan being million 
in addition  loans of million or more represented approximately of the loan portfolio 
these indicators have improved slightly for a number of quarters as new loan originations have been curtailed dramatically since the middle of and those loans that were originated were smaller balance loans 
the default of a larger size loan may have a greater negative impact on our lending losses 
ii concentrations of our loans 
our loan portfolio is concentrated in loans secured by commercial and multifamily real estate  including some properties that are vacant or substantially vacant and vacant land  all of which are generally considered to have more credit risk than traditional family residential lending because these loans tend to involve larger loan balances to single borrowers and their repayment is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the underlying real estate for income producing properties 
additionally  loans on vacant properties and land typically do not have adequate or any income streams and depend upon other sources of cash flow from the borrower for repayment 
the number of vacant land loans in the portfolio  while never a substantial amount relative to the entire portfolio  has decreased substantially over the last several years and currently represents approximately of the portfolio or million 
these vacant land loans are personally guaranteed 
the properties that collateralize our loans are also concentrated in two states  new york and florida  and many are located in geographical areas of those states that are being revitalized or redeveloped  which are negatively impacted to a greater degree in an economic downturn 
both of these states have experienced weak economic conditions  high rates of unemployment  increased office and retail vacancy rates and lower real estate values 
additionally  many of the multifamily properties located in new york city and surrounding boroughs are also subject to rent control and rent stabilization laws  which limit the ability of the property owners to increase rents  which may in turn limit the borrower s ability to repay those mortgage loans 
all of the above factors increase the risk profile of our loan portfolio 
iii changes in our review of specific problem loans  including loans on nonaccrual status  and estimates of fair value of the underlying properties 
when a loan experiences payment problems  an internal review is initiated by our chief credit officer to re evaluate the internal credit rating that is assigned to the loan 

table of contents we also engage an independent third party to perform quarterly reviews of the portfolio  which includes all problem loans 
nonaccrual and or problem loans are normally downgraded based on known facts and circumstances at the time of review  which includes the review of rent rolls  financial statements and strength of borrower s repayment sources and a physical inspection and a determination of the estimated fair value of the collateral property 
estimates of fair value are determined based on a variety of information  including available appraisals and the knowledge and experience of our two senior lending officers and chief credit officer related to values of properties in our lending market areas 
our policy is to obtain externally prepared appraisals or other indications of value for all new  restructured  or renewed loans  upon the classification or downgrade of a loan  and upon foreclosure and transfer of a loan to foreclosed real estate  and at least annually thereafter for all impaired loans and real estate owned 
in addition to appraisals  consideration is also given to the type  location and occupancy of the property and current economic conditions in the area the property is located in assessing estimates of fair value 
we believe our process of reviewing loans and determining estimated fair values is effective 
iv changes in the volume of our past due loans  nonaccrual loans and adversely classified assets 
on may   we sold a total of million of certain non performing and underperforming loans in a bulk sale in order to expedite the resolution of such assets 
due to the then market conditions  the assets were sold at a significant discount to their net carrying values 
this transaction significantly decreased our nonaccrual and problem loans 
in addition  our special mention and substandard rated loans decreased from approximately million and million  respectively  prior to the bulk sale to approximately million and million  respectively  at december  in determining our historical loss rate  we excluded the effect of the may bulk sale since these assets were sold substantially below their net carrying values as we were required to expedite the reduction of our problem assets during a time when the financial markets were volatile and real property values were depressed 
a transaction that is unusual and deemed not reflective of normal charge off history can be excluded from an historical analysis and we believe the net result of the bulk sale is not indicative of the ultimate losses that would have occurred had the assets been resolved on an individual basis  over time and not on a steeply discounted immediate bulk sale basis 
v adverse situations which may affect our borrowers ability to repay 
nonaccrual problem loans are reviewed individually based on the facts and circumstances known to us at that time 
an assessment is made as to whether there are specific issues unique to each loan or borrower that caused the problem or whether such issues identified are generic systemic to the entire or a large portion of the loan portfolio and as such increase the risk profile of the loan portfolio 
in addition to the negative impact from the weak economy  high rates of unemployment  and increased office and retail vacancy rates  we believe that a large number of our loans that became nonaccrual also had specific issues unique to each loan that resulted in the loan being classified as nonaccrual 
vi changes in national  regional and local new york and florida economic and business conditions and other developments that may affect the collectability of our loan portfolio  including impacts of political  regulatory  legal and competitive changes on the portfolio 
we continually monitor real estate market and economic conditions  both locally in our lending areas and on a national level 
the monitoring process is done through the review of various publications  discussions with brokers and existing customers and analysis of market rents 
the economy and commercial and multifamily real estate markets both nationally and in our new york and florida markets remain weak  although they show signs of improvement 
political and regulatory issues  including armed conflicts and acts of terrorism  or natural disasters such as hurricanes  may have an adverse impact on economic conditions as a whole and may be more pronounced on loans in specific geographic regions 
vii changes to our lending policies and procedures  underwriting standards  risk selection loan volumes and loan terms and to our collection  loan chargeoff and recovery practices 
we have not relaxed any of these policies  procedures and practices 
furthermore  we believe that we have become more risk averse over the last year by being more selective in originating new loans 
the loan to value ratio the ratio that the original principal amount of the loan bears to the lower of the purchase price or appraised value of the property securing the loan at the time of origination on a new loan normally does not exceed 

table of contents the debt service coverage ratio the ratio of the net operating income generated by the property securing the loan to the required debt service on a new loan typically is not less than times 
we have also enhanced our loan monitoring procedures by creating penetration reports and enhancing exception reports evidencing various types of financial or performance data of the collateral property  and accelerating the ordering of new appraisals when loans are experiencing difficulty 
in addition  reviews and action plans are updated on a quarterly basis for all classified loans 
viii changes in the experience  ability and depth of our lending management and other relevant staff 
during  we hired a chief credit officer with years of experience who reviews the assignment of credit ratings for all loans and attends all loan committee meetings and provides his input 
we also added to and expect to continue to expand the number of our loan relationship managers to monitor our loans 
these changes coupled with the depth of our existing staff and the substantial experience of our chairman and president in commercial and multifamily real estate lending have had a positive effect on this qualitative factor 
we believe there is substantial experience on our lending and underwriting staff and on our loan committee 
in addition the general component discussed earlier  the specific component of the allowance relates to loans that are impaired 
a loan is normally deemed impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect both principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we consider a variety of factors in determining whether a loan is impaired  including i any notice from the borrower that the borrower will be unable to repay all principal and interest amounts contractually due under the loan agreement  ii any delinquency in the principal and or interest payments other than minimal delays or shortfalls in payments  and iii other information known by us that would indicate the full repayment of principal and interest is not probable 
we generally consider delinquencies of days or less to be minimal delays  and accordingly do not consider such delinquent loans to be impaired in the absence of other indications 
our impaired loans normally consist of loans on nonaccrual status and those classified as troubled debt restructurings tdrs 
generally  impairment for all of our loans is calculated on a loan by loan basis using either the estimated fair value of the loan s collateral less estimated selling costs for collateral dependent loans or the present value of the loan s cash flows for non collateral dependent loans 
any calculated impairment is recognized as a valuation allowance within the overall allowance for loan losses and a charge through the provision for loan losses 
we may charge off any portion of the impaired loan with a corresponding decrease to the valuation allowance when such impairment is deemed uncollectible 
the net carrying amount of an impaired loan net of the valuation allowance does not at any time exceed the recorded investment in the loan 
valuation allowance for real estate losses 
we maintain a valuation allowance for real estate we acquire through foreclosure 
we estimate the fair value of our real estate in the same manner as impaired loans 
as the properties are actively marketed for sale  we may periodically adjust the carrying values of the real estate to reflect changes in fair values resulting from changing market conditions through an increase to the valuation allowance for real estate losses and a charge to the provision for real estate losses 
we believe  based on information known to us at december   that the level of our allowance for loan losses and valuation allowance for real estate losses was adequate to cover estimated losses in our loan and real estate owned portfolios at such date 
although we believe we use the best information available to make determinations with respect to these allowances  future adjustments to one or both allowances may be necessary if facts and circumstances differ from those previously assumed in their determination 
for example  a prolonged downturn in real estate values and economic conditions could have an adverse impact on our asset quality and may result in a higher level of losses than we have provide for which would result in additional loss provisions 
additionally  our regulators  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review both of these allowances based on the regulators judgment concerning information available to them during their examination process as well as other factors they utilize for all banks 
accordingly  they may require us to take certain chargeoffs and or recognize additions to the allowances based on their judgments 

table of contents valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
at december   we determined that we were not required to maintain a valuation allowance for our deferred tax asset 
the need for as well as adjustments increases or decreases to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance is determined by us based upon changes in the expected realization of the deferred tax assets 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets for recoverability quarterly based on all available evidence 
this process involves significant judgment on our part and includes assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between our projected earnings and our actual results 
we are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine  based on available evidence at the time the determination is made  that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be fully realized 
in evaluating the more likely than not criterion  we consider all positive and negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period 
the realization of our deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient future taxable income in the carryforward period under the tax law 
due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances  we may be required to establish and or record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods 
such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and regulatory capital position 
as disclosed in greater detail in note to the consolidated financial statements in this report  at december   we had a deferred tax asset in the amount of million  which includes a gross net operating loss carryfoward nol totaling million representing million of the total deferred tax asset 
we have determined that a valuation allowance was not required at any time during the reporting periods in this report because we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax asset will be fully realized 
this conclusion is based on our prior earnings history exclusive of the nol generated in the second quarter of coupled with evidence such as our profitable fourth quarter of indicating that we will be able to generate an adequate amount of future taxable income over a reasonable period of time to fully utilize the deferred tax asset 
our ability to realize our deferred tax asset could be reduced in the future if our estimates of future taxable income from our operations and tax planning strategies do not support the realization of our deferred tax asset 
we also need to consider that the amount of our nols and certain other tax attributes realizable for income tax purposes may be reduced under section of the internal revenue code by sales of our common stock  including transactions in the open market by or greater shareholders  if an ownership change is deemed to have occured under section of the internal revenue code by such sales 
the determination of whether an ownership change has occurred is highly fact specific and can occur through one or more acquisitions of capital stock including open market trading if the result of such acquisitions is that the percentage of our outstanding common stock held by shareholders or groups of shareholders owning at least of our common stock at the time of such acquisition  as determined under section  is more than percentage points higher than the lowest percentage of our outstanding common stock owned by such shareholders or groups of shareholders within the prior three year period 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  in may  october and november  ibc sold to various investors   and  shares of its class a common stock  respectively 
we have determined based on an internal analysis that the completion of these transactions did not result in a change of control as defined by section  although no assurance can be given that taxing authorities would agree with such determination 
the combination of these sales with any future sales of ibc s common stock during the period defined above  could increase the risk of a change in control as determined under section and result in the partial loss of the availability of our nols  which would require us to expense a portion of our then deferred tax asset amount 
other than temporary impairment charges on security investments 
for a discussion of the factors and estimates used in assessing for and computing other than temporary impairment charges on our security investments  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents comparison of financial condition at december  and a comparison of selected consolidated balance sheet information follows at december  at december  in thousands carrying value of total assets carrying value of total assets cash and cash equivalents security investments loans receivable  net of deferred fees and allowance for loan losses foreclosed real estate  net of valuation allowance all other assets total assets deposits borrowed funds and related interest payable all other liabilities total liabilities total stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity general consolidated assets at december  decreased by million  or  to billion  from billion at december   primarily reflecting a decrease in loans receivable and security investments  partially offset by increases in cash equivalents and all other assets 
the net reduction in the size of our balance sheet in was the result of several factors discussed below 
on may   in order to accelerate the reduction of our problem assets  we completed a transaction to remove a large portion of our problem assets from our balance sheet 
we sold in bulk certain non performing and underperforming loans on commercial real estate and multifamily properties and some real estate owned 
the assets sold aggregated to approximately million and consisted of million of loans and million of real estate owned 
all of the assets were sold at a substantial discount to their net carrying values of million for an aggregate purchase price of million  or million after selling costs 
as a result of this bulk sale  we recorded a million combined provision for loan and real estate losses  which contributed approximately million to our net loss of million for at december   our deferred tax asset increased by million from december  to million 
a large portion of the increase was attributable to the tax effect of the net operating loss carryfoward generated by this bulk sale transaction 
also contributing to the decrease in our balance sheet was higher regulatory capital requirements applicable to inb 
during  inb gradually reduced its balance sheet by decreasing its deposit rates and encouraging net deposit outflow  repaying its borrowed funds as they matured and decreasing the volume of its new loan originations from historical levels 
these actions accounted for an additional million net decrease in our balance sheet  which positively impacted our regulatory capital ratios 
in order to increase inb s regulatory capital  ibc raised additional capital in in may  ibc sold in a private placement  shares of its class a common stock at a price of per share for net proceeds of approximately million 
in october  ibc sold in an underwritten public offering  shares of its class a common stock at a price of per share for net proceeds of approximately million 
in november  the underwriter of the public offering exercised a portion of its over allotment option to purchase an additional  shares of class a common stock at a price of per share for additional net proceeds of approximately million 
ibc invested nearly all of the proceeds totaling million from these transactions as capital contributions to inb 
inb s capital ratios at december  were in excess of its regulatory capital requirements 
see the section supervision and regulation and notes and to the consolidated financial statements in this report for more information regarding our capital requirements as well as a discussion of our formal agreements with our regulators 

table of contents cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents include interest bearing and noninterest bearing cash balances with banks  and other short term investments that have original maturities of three months or less 
cash and cash equivalents increased to million at december  from million at december  the level of cash and cash equivalents fluctuates based on various factors  including our liquidity needs  loan demand  deposit flows  calls of securities  repayments of borrowed funds and alternative investment opportunities 
see the section liquidity and capital resources in this report for a discussion of our liquidity 
security investments security investments consist of securities held to maturity and federal reserve bank frb and federal home loan bank of new york fhlb stock 
securities are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost when we have the intent and ability to hold them to maturity 
such investments  all of which are held by inb  decreased to million at december   from million at december  the decrease reflected million of calls  million of maturities  a million transfer to the available for sale portfolio and million of impairment writedowns 
the aggregate of these items exceeded million of new purchases during the period 
in  inb s investment portfolio experienced a high level of calls by the issuers due to the low interest rate environment 
in march  securities held to maturity with a carrying value of million estimated fair value of million were transferred to the available for sale category and promptly sold 
a gain of million was realized from this transaction 
the securities sold consisted of non callable  fixed rate us government agency securities that were scheduled to mature at various times from through this transaction was undertaken as one of the steps to enhance inb s capital levels in response to its higher regulatory capital requirements 
at december  and  there were no securities classified as available for sale 
at december   securities held to maturity consisted of investment grade rated debt obligations of the federal home loan bank  federal farm credit bank  federal national mortgage association and federal home loan mortgage corporation totaling million and noninvestment grade rated corporate securities consisting of variable rate pooled trust preferred securities backed by obligations of companies in the banking industry totaling million 
as discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements in this report  impairment charges totaling million have been recorded on these trust preferred security investments 
at december   the held to maturity portfolio had a weighted average yield to earliest call date of and a weighted average remaining contractual maturity of years 
nearly all of the securities have fixed interest rates or have predetermined rate increases and call features that allow the issuer to call the security before its stated maturity without penalty 
over the next twelve months  approximately million of securities in the portfolio could potentially be called assuming interest rates remain at or near levels as of december  a large portion of the resulting proceeds would then be reinvested into similar securities and potentially at lower rates 
securities with call features routinely have higher yields than securities with non callable features with the same maturity at the time of purchase 
however  the lack of call protection or the expiration of the non callable period of the security will most likely result in the early call of securities in a declining or flat rate environment  which results in re investment risk of the proceeds 
at december  and  the held to maturity portfolio s estimated fair value was million and million  respectively 
at december   the portfolio had a net unrealized loss of million  compared to a net unrealized loss of million at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements in this report for information on and a discussion of unrealized losses 
for additional historical information on the securities portfolio  see the caption entitled security investment activities in item business of this report 

table of contents in order for inb to be a member of frb and fhlb  inb must maintain an investment in the capital stock of each entity  which amounted to million and million  respectively  at december  the frb stock has historically paid a dividend of  while the fhlb stock dividend fluctuates quarterly and was most recently at the rate of for the quarter ended december  the total required investment fluctuates based on inb s capital level for the frb stock and inb s loans and outstanding fhlb borrowings for the fhlb stock 
loans receivable  net of deferred fees total loans receivable  net of unearned fees  amounted to billion at december   a million decrease from billion at december  the decrease was due to million of principal repayments resulting from the bulk sale of loans  other loan payoffs and normal amortization  million of loans transferred to real estate owned and million of loan chargeoffs which included approximately million of chargeoffs related to the bulk sale  partially offset by million of new loan originations 
the new loan originations are secured primarily by commercial real estate and the loans are nearly all fixed rate with a weighted average yield and term of and years  respectively 
the terms of these loans have largely been a function of the demand by borrowers for longer term  fixed rate product that has been driven by the historically low interest rate environment 
we expect this demand for longer term  fixed rate product to continue for the foreseeable future 
fixed rate loans constituted approximately of the consolidated loan portfolio at december  see the section asset and liability management for a further discussion of fixed rate loans 
new loan originations for decreased from million in  reflecting the effects of a decrease in suitable lending opportunities for us as well as inb s efforts to shrink its balance sheet and maintain its loan portfolio at a prudent level relative to its increased capital requirements 
for additional information on and discussion of the loan portfolio  see the section entitled lending activities in item business of this report 
nonaccrual and restructured loans impaired loans nonaccrual loans decreased to million or loans at december   from million or loans at december  loans classified as troubled debt restructurings tdrs decreased to million or loans at december   from million or loans at december  as a result of the bulk sale of assets described earlier  our impaired loans nonaccrual loans and tdrs decreased substantially from december  tdrs are loans on which inb has granted certain concessions to provide payment relief to the borrower 
these concessions generally consist of the deferral of principal and or interest payments for a period of time  or a partial reduction in interest payments 
in the third quarter of  inb re classified approximately million of performing tdrs to nonaccrual status based on regulatory guidance 
these tdrs continue to pay as agreed under their renegotiated terms 
at december   a specific valuation allowance included as part of the overall allowance for loan losses in the amount of million was maintained on nonaccrual loans and million for tdrs 
at december   there were three loans totaling million that were classified as ninety days past due and still accruing interest 
these loans were past their maturity date but the borrowers were making monthly loan payments 
the majority of these loans are expected to be extended at market terms 
in addition to our nonaccrual loans and tdrs  at december   there were an additional loans totaling million for which there were concerns regarding the ability of the borrowers to meet existing repayment terms 
these loans are classified as substandard for regulatory purposes and reflect the distinct possibility  but not the probability  that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan 
such loans may never become delinquent  nonaccrual or impaired 
potential problem loans are considered in the determination of the overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
for additional information on and discussion of nonaccrual loans  tdrs and potential problem loans  see the section entitled asset quality in item business of this report 

table of contents allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses amounted to million at december   compared to million at december  the allowance represented of total loans net of deferred fees outstanding at december   compared to at december  the net change in the allowance in was due to million of loan loss provisions and million of recoveries  nearly all of which was offset by million of chargeoffs 
approximately million of the chargeoffs and million of the provisions was attributable to the bulk sale 
approximately million of the provisions was attributable to the following factors credit rating downgrades on various loans  lower estimates of value on several collateral properties resulting in loan chargeoffs  our assessment of the continued weakness in the economies and commercial real estate markets in florida and new york and their impact on our loan portfolio  and input received from inb s primary regulator 
at december  and  the allowance for loan losses included a specific valuation allowance in the aggregate amount of million and million  respectively  for total nonaccrual and restructured loans  all of which are considered impaired loans 
the reduction in the valuation allowance was due to the chargeoffs attributable to the bulk sale and a lower level of impaired loans 
for additional information on and discussion of the allowance for loan losses  see the caption entitled allowance for loan losses in item business of this report 
for a discussion of the criteria used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  see the section entitled critical accounting policies at the beginning of item of this report 
foreclosed real estate real estate acquired through foreclosure  net of a valuation allowance  amounted to million at december   compared to million at december  for additional information on and discussion of foreclosed real estate  see the section entitled asset quality in item business of this report 
all other assets the following table sets forth the composition of all other assets at december  in thousands accrued interest receivable loan fees receivable income tax receivable premises and equipment  net deferred income tax asset deferred debenture offering costs  net investment in unconsolidated subsidiaries deferred issuance costs from brokered cds prepaid deposit insurance assessments all other accrued interest receivable fluctuates based on the level of interest earning assets and the timing of interest payments received 
loan fees receivable are fees due to us in accordance with the terms of our mortgage loans 
such amounts are generally due upon the full repayment of the loan 
this fee is recorded as deferred income at the time a loan is originated and is then amortized to interest income over the life of the loan as a yield adjustment 
the decrease was due to payments exceeding new fees that were charged on new loan originations as well as a lower level of new originations 
the increase in income tax receivable is due to the projected partial carryback of the nol generated in the second quarter of this receivable represents mostly federal income taxes we paid on our taxable income in and that are refundable under nol carryback rules 
this receivable is expected to be collected from the internal revenue service shortly after completion and filing of our federal income tax return in premises and equipment decreased as purchases were more than offset by normal depreciation and amortization 

table of contents the deferred tax asset relates to the unrealized benefit for net temporary differences between the our financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases that will result in future income tax deductions 
such items are normally comprised of the allowance for loan losses  valuation allowance for real estate losses and capitalized real estate expenses  all of which will become tax deductible when actual chargeoffs are incurred  and our net operating loss carryforward that can be used to offset future taxable income 
the increase in the deferred tax asset was attributable to the tax effect of the net operating loss carryforward generated by bulk sale transaction in may see the section critical accounting policies and note to the consolidated financial statements in this report for further discussion of the deferred tax asset 
deferred debenture offering costs consist primarily of underwriters commissions and are amortized over the terms of the debentures 
the net decrease was due to normal amortization 
the investment in unconsolidated subsidiaries consists of ibc s total common stock investment in its wholly owned business trusts  intervest statutory trust ii  iii  iv and v 
prepaid deposit insurance assessments relates to the unamortized portion of the estimated amount of inb s fdic insurance premiums for and that was prepaid by inb on december  this prepayment requirement was imposed on all fdic insured institutions in order to recapitalize the deposit insurance fund 
the prepaid asset will be charged to expense during the future periods to which it relates 
deferred issuance costs from brokered deposits decreased due to normal amortization 
these costs are being amortized to interest expense over the life of the deposits 
deposits deposits at december  decreased to billion from billion at december   due to a million decrease in time deposits and a million decrease in money market deposit accounts  resulting from inb s planned shrinkage through a reduction in its deposit rates 
at december   certificate of deposit accounts totaled billion  and checking  savings and money market accounts aggregated to million 
the same categories of deposit accounts totaled billion and million  respectively  at december  certificate of deposit accounts represented of total consolidated deposits at december   compared to at december  at december  and  certificate of deposit accounts included million and million of brokered deposits  respectively

net interest and dividend income net interest and dividend income is our primary source of earnings and is influenced by the amount  distribution and repricing characteristics of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as by the relative levels and movements of interest rates 
net interest and dividend income is the difference between interest income earned on our interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and interest expense paid on our interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
as detailed in the table that follows  net interest and dividend income increased by million to million in  from million in the increase in income reflected an improved net interest margin  partially offset by the impact of the planned reduction in the size of our balance sheet as well as the sale of performing loans as part of the bulk sale

average balances are derived from daily balances 
net interest margin is computed by dividing net interest and dividend income by the average of total interest earning assets during each year 
the interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities

liquidity and capital resources general 
liquidity risk involves the risk of being unable to fund our assets with the appropriate duration and rate based liabilities  as well as the risk of not being able to meet unexpected cash needs 
we manage our liquidity position on a daily basis to assure that funds are available to meet our operating requirements  loan and investment commitments  deposit withdrawals and debt service obligations 
our primary sources of funds consist of the following retail deposits obtained through inb s branch offices and the mail  principal repayments of loans  maturities and calls of securities  borrowings through fhlb advances or the federal funds market  brokered deposits  and cash flow provided by our operating activities 
for additional detail concerning our actual cash flows  see the consolidated statements of cash flows included in this report 
intervest national bank 
inb s lending business is dependent on its ability to generate a positive interest rate spread between the yields earned on its loans and the rates offered on its deposits 
inb relies heavily on certificates of deposit time deposits as its main source of funds and it needs to pay competitive interest rates to attract and retain deposits to fund its loan originations 
the stability of deposits as a funding source is affected by numerous factors  including returns available to our depositors on alternative investments  safety and fdic insurance limits  the quality of our customer service and other competitive forces 
due primarily to higher regulatory capital requirements applicable to inb  inb gradually reduced its balance sheet during by decreasing its deposit rates and encouraging deposit outflow 
inb may reduce its deposits further during and expects to fund any deposit reductions mainly through the expected calls of its agency security investments 
inb s objective is to maintain its deposit rates at levels that will promote a stable deposit base and at the same time adjust to its cash flow needs 
see the section supervision and regulation for restrictions placed on inb with respect to deposits rates it can offer and on accepting  renewing and rolling over brokered deposits 
total deposits decreased to billion at december   from billion at december   reflecting decreases of million in certificate of deposit accounts cds and million in money market deposit accounts

ibc s historical sources of funds to meet its obligations have been derived from the following interest income from short term investments  monthly dividends from inb  and monthly management fees from its subsidiaries for providing them with certain administrative services 
ibc s historical sources of working capital have been derived from the issuance of its common stock through public or private offerings  exercise of its common stock warrants  the issuance of its trust preferred securities and preferred stock and the issuance of its subordinated debentures to the public 
during  imc distributed million of its cash on hand to ibc as a return of capital  which was redeployed by ibc as additional capital investments in inb 
at december   ibc had issued and outstanding million of trust preferred securities and million of series a preferred stock held by the us treasury  all of which are eligible for inclusion in ibc s tier regulatory capital 
the proceeds from the issuances of these securities have been invested in inb at various times through capital contributions 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements in this report 
the trust preferred securities contractually mature at various times through and as of december  had the following interest rates million had variable rates that reset quarterly based on month libor plus an additional predetermined spread ranging from to basis points  and the remaining million was fixed at until september   and thereafter reverts to a variable rate that resets quarterly based on month libor plus an additional basis points 
the holder of the series a preferred stock is entitled to a quarterly cash dividend at the rate of per year until december  after which the dividend rate increases to per year 
dividends need not be declared and paid  but the dividend is a cumulative dividend and failure by ibc to pay dividends for six dividend periods  whether or not consecutive  would trigger board appointment rights for the holder of the preferred stock 
prior to january   inb paid cash dividends to ibc for the debt service on ibc s trust preferred securities as well as for ibc s payment of dividends on the preferred stock 
in january  inb was informed by its primary regulator  the occ  that it is not permitted to pay any cash dividends to ibc 
inb accordingly suspended its cash dividend payments to ibc 
in turn  ibc also suspended its payments of interest on the trust preferred securities as well as preferred dividend payments as discussed below 
in february  the frb  ibc s primary regulator  informed ibc that it may not  without the prior approval of the frb  pay dividends on or redeem its capital stock  pay interest on or redeem its trust preferred securities  or incur new debt 
at december   the total amount of undeclared and unpaid dividends in arrears was million 
in march  ibc also exercised its right to defer regularly scheduled interest payments on its million of junior subordinated notes relating to its outstanding trust preferred securities noted above 
ibc has the right to defer such payments for up to consecutive quarterly periods without default or penalty 
during the deferral period  the respective statutory trusts  which are wholly owned subsidiaries of ibc that were formed to issue the trust preferred securities  have likewise suspended the declaration and payment of dividends on the trust preferred securities 
the regularly scheduled interest payments continue to be accrued for payment in the future and are reported as interest expense for financial statement purposes 
at december   the total amount of accrued and unpaid interest was million 

table of contents the deferral of interest payments as well as the suspension of preferred dividend payments is likely to adversely affect ibc s ability to borrow funds on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
the interest and preferred dividend payments referred to above will resume at such time as both ibc and inb are permitted to do so and upon the determination that such payments are consistent with ibc s and inb s overall financial performance and capital requirements

table of contents asset and liability management we have interest rate risk that arises from differences in the repricing of our assets and liabilities within a given time period 
we have never engaged in trading or hedging activities  nor invested in interest rate derivatives or entered into interest rate swaps 
the primary objective of our asset liability management strategy is to limit  within established guidelines  the adverse effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and capital 
in this regard  inb  whose assets represent of our consolidated assets  engages an outside consultant to prepare quarterly reports using an earnings simulation model to quantify the effects of various interest rate scenarios on inb s projected net interest and dividend income over specified periods 
these computations begin with our internally prepared gap analysis which is then further adjusted for additional assumptions regarding balance sheet growth and composition  and the pricing and repricing and maturity characteristics of inb s balance sheet 
gap analysis measures the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice within a given time period 
as noted in the footnotes to the gap table that follows  there are numerous assumptions that are made by us to compute the gap 
a change in any of these assumptions would materially alter the results of the gap analysis as well as the simulation analysis noted above 
an asset or liability is normally considered to be interest rate sensitive if it will reprice or mature within one year or less 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities scheduled to mature or reprice within one year 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
conversely  a gap is considered negative when the opposite is true 
in a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to increase net interest income 
in a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to increase net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
if the repricing of our assets and liabilities were equally flexible and moved concurrently  the impact of any increase or decrease in interest rates on our net interest income would be minimal 
a simple interest rate gap analysis by itself may not be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates for the following reasons 
income associated with interest earning assets and costs associated with interest bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates 
in addition  the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
callable features of certain assets and liabilities  in addition to the foregoing  may also cause actual experience to vary from the analysis 
in addition  certain assets with adjustable rates may have features generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors  which limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  asset prepayment and early deposit withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the interest rate gap 
the amount of loan prepayments cannot be predicted with accuracy and we experience reinvestment risk associated with the investment of the resulting proceeds 
the ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase  and the behavior of depositors may be different from those assumed in the gap analysis 
the number of fixed rate loans in our loan portfolio has increased significantly over the last several years 
to illustrate  fixed rate loans constituted approximately of our loan portfolio at december   compared to approximately at december  we also have many loans approximately of the portfolio that have terms that call for predetermined interest rate increases at various times over the life of the loan  which may or may not be at the same magnitude as general changes in market rates 
we also have a limited number approximately of the portfolio of floating rate loans that have a floor or minimum rate that was determined in relation to prevailing market rates on the date of origination 
this floor only adjusts upwards in the event of increases in the loan s interest rate 

table of contents the table below summarizes our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december   that are scheduled to mature or reprice within the periods shown 
in thousands months months over years over years total loans securities held to maturity short term investments frb and fhlb stock total rate sensitive assets deposit accounts interest checking deposits savings deposits money market deposits certificates of deposit total deposits fhlb advances debentures and mortgage note payable accrued interest on all borrowed funds total borrowed funds total rate sensitive liabilities gap repricing differences cumulative gap cumulative gap to total assets significant assumptions used in preparing the gap table above follow floating rate loans  loans with predetermined rate increases and floating rate borrowings are included in the period in which their interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they mature 
fixed rate loans and borrowings are scheduled according to their contractual maturities 
deferred loan fees and the effect of possible loan prepayments are excluded from the analysis 
nonaccrual loans of million and foreclosed real estate of million are also excluded from the table although some portion is expected to return to an interest earning status in the near term 
securities are scheduled according to the earlier of their next callable date or the date on which the interest rate on the security is scheduled to change 
nearly all have predetermined interest rate increases or steps up to a specified rate on one or more predetermined dates 
generally  the security becomes eligible for redemption by the issuer at the date of the first scheduled step up 
the net carrying value million of corporate securities that are on a cash basis of accounting are excluded from the table 
interest checking  savings and money market deposits are regarded as readily accessible withdrawable accounts and certificates of deposit are scheduled according to their contractual maturity dates 
this assumption contributes significantly to the liability sensitive position reported per the one year gap analysis 
however  if such deposits were treated differently  the one year gap would then change 
depositors may not necessarily immediately withdraw funds in the event deposit rates offered by inb did not change as quickly and uniformly as changes in general market rates 
at december   the gap analysis above indicated that our interest bearing liabilities that were scheduled to mature or reprice within one year exceeded our interest earning assets that were scheduled to mature or reprice within one year 
this one year interest rate sensitivity gap amounted to a negative million  or a negative of total assets  at december  as a result of the negative one year gap  the composition of our balance sheet at december  was considered liability sensitive  indicating that our interest bearing liabilities would generally reprice with changes in interest rates more rapidly than our interest earning assets 
based on our recent analysis of the earnings simulation model described earlier  the two year cumulative risk to our net interest and dividend income would be a negative for a basis point rate decrease shock and a negative for a basis point rate increase shock 
the model covers a month horizon and assumes interest rate changes are gradually ramped up or down over a month horizon using various assumptions based upon a parallel yield curve shift and subsequently sustained at those levels for the remainder of the simulation horizon 
there can be no assurances that a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may not adversely impact our net interest and dividend income to a larger extent if interest rates on our assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis  than those assumed in the model 

table of contents recent accounting standards update see note the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of this topic 
impact of inflation and changing prices our financial statements and related financial data presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
because virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and in prices 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in our lending  security investing  deposit taking and borrowing activities 
we do not engage in and accordingly have no risk related to trading accounts  commodities  interest rate hedges or foreign exchange 
the measurement of market risk associated with financial instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated  and the resulting net positions are identified 
disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments which reflect changes in market prices and rates  can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we also actively monitor and manage our interest rate risk exposure as discussed under the caption asset and liability management
