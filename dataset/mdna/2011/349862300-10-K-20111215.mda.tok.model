business overview trends and economic environment in executing the channel building and product development elements of our strategy  during fiscal we have incurred  and we intend to continue to incur  significantly increased selling  general  and administrative expenses as we devote resources to recruit  hire and compensate experienced sales  design  operations  and administrative professionals  and to develop and or acquire new product offerings 
insofar as most of our new personnel were hired in the second half of fiscal  with further investment in personnel planned for the first quarter of fiscal  the fourth quarter of fiscal  and succeeding reporting periods will begin to reflect more fully our investments in resources  while the anticipated benefits of such hires in the form of increased sales and profit will take significantly longer to be realized  if at all 
at the same time  we are investing resources in bringing new products to market  particularly in terms of funding product development activities with prospective partners 
we anticipate that the measure of success of our strategy as reflected in our results of operations will be determined by the strength of new distribution channels  by the speed in which we can bring new products to market  and by the success and acceptance of these products in the marketplace 
with regard to our oem business  we have recently been awarded several large programs by two major diabetic customers 
we anticipate that these programs will begin to contribute meaningfully to revenues beginning in late fiscal while these new programs will increase our sales volume  we anticipate that gross margins on certain of these new or prospective programs will be lower than the gross margins seen in the first part of fiscal our business remains highly concentrated by customer and product type  especially in the diabetic case product line 
however  as we indicated in previous reports  we intended to build on the growth in revenue that was contributed by other products in fiscal  and in fiscal we have exceeded such targets 
accordingly  even as diabetic product sales continue to increase  we believe that we are making progress in diversifying the customer base 
we continue to operate in a very challenging pricing and gross margin environment with our oem customers 
the global economy continues to face headwinds  and our oem customers remain very price sensitive 
as reflected in the gross profit discussions below  we are encountering higher costs from our china based suppliers due to materials and labor price increases  placing continuing pressure on profit margins 
as the expected launch of new and replacement diabetic programs increasingly replace mature programs  we anticipate that the impact of materials and labor cost increases from our china based suppliers will become more evident in this product line and gross profit generally 
product mix factors may exacerbate this trend 
in many cases  we are not able to pass higher costs through to customers  particularly when replacement program products resemble their predecessor or historically similar products for which customers have become accustomed to a narrow price range 
see risk factors in item a of this annual report 
we are actively looking at alternative sources of supply  as well as other geographic regions to expand and diversify our manufacturing capabilities in order to mitigate this trend 
variability of revenues and results of operation because a high percentage of our sales revenues is highly concentrated in a few large customers  and because the volumes of these customers order flows to us are highly variable  with short lead times  our quarterly revenues  and consequently our results of operations  are susceptible to significant variability over a relatively short period of time 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the accounting policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the discussion below is not intended to be comprehensive 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment of a particular transaction 
in other cases  management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion of the applications of these and other accounting policies  refer to
