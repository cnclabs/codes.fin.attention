strategy autodesk s vision is to help people imagine  design and create a better world 
we do this by developing software for the world s designers  architects  engineers  and digital artists the people who create the products  buildings  infrastructure  films  and games 
autodesk serves customers in three primary markets architecture  engineering and construction  manufacturing  and digital media and entertainment 
our goal is to provide our customers with the world s most valuable  innovative  and engaging software and services 
our product and services portfolio allow our customers to digitally visualize  simulate  and analyze their projects  helping them to better understand the consequences of their design decisions  save time  money  and resources  and become more innovative 
today complex challenges such as globalization  urbanization  and sustainable design are driving our customers to new levels of performance and competitiveness  and we are committed to helping them address those challenges and take advantage of new opportunities 
to achieve these goals  we are capitalizing on two of our strongest competitive advantages our ability to bring advanced technology to mainstream markets  and the breadth and depth of our product portfolio 
by innovating in existing technology categories  we bring powerful new design capabilities to volume markets 
our products are designed to be easy to learn and use  and to provide customers with a low cost of deployment  a low total cost of ownership  and a rapid return on investment 
in addition  our software architecture allows for extensibility and integration with other products 
the breadth of our technology and product line gives us a unique competitive advantage  because it allows our customers to address a wide variety of problems in ways that transcend industry and disciplinary boundaries 
this is particularly important in helping our customers address the complex challenges mentioned above 
we also believe that our technological leadership and global brand recognition have positioned us well for long term growth and industry leadership 

table of contents in addition to the competitive advantages afforded by our technology  our large global network of distributors  resellers  third party developers  customers  educational institutions  faculty and students is a key competitive advantage 
this network of relationships provides us with a broad and deep reach into volume markets around the world 
our distributor and reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with the resources to purchase  deploy  learn  and support our products quickly and easily 
we have a significant number of registered third party developers who create products that work well with autodesk products and extend them for a variety of specialized applications 
users fluent in our products are broadly and globally available from educational institutions and in the existing workforce 
we offer extensive educational programs  including student versions of software  curricula  and faculty development 
we have an extensive global community of students who are fluent in our software and poised to become the next generation of professional users thus reducing the cost of training and providing fresh talent for our customers 
our global network of distributors  resellers  third party developers  customers  educational institutions and students has been developed over our twenty eight year history 
we believe it is an enduring competitive advantage that is difficult for others to replicate 
our growth strategy includes continually increasing the business value of our design tools to our customers in a number of ways 
first  we seek to address an increasing portion of our customers workflow with products that extend the value of our customers digital design information into visualization  analysis  and simulation 
second  we extend our customers workflow with products for adjacent users and for the customers of our customers  thus increasing the value of the design information our customers produce 
third  we seek to improve our product interoperability and usability  thus improving our customers productivity and effectiveness 
fourth  we develop new ways to deliver capability and value to our customers  such as product suites  software as a service  mobile devices  and new hardware platforms 
notably  in october  we released autocad for the mac  reaching a large base of native mac environment customers 
finally  we have developed a new line of consumer products for the web  ipad  and mobile devices that provide our advanced visualization technologies to consumers a whole new category of autodesk customer 
a number of our customers use our horizontal design products  autocad and autocad lt 
we also develop a large number of vertical model based design products 
we believe that expanding our horizontal design product customers portfolios to include our vertical design products and our model based design products  and now our suites  presents a meaningful growth opportunity and is an important part of our overall strategy 
for fiscal  revenue from model based design products increased as compared to the prior fiscal year and as a percentage of revenue  increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal for fiscal  revenue from suites increased  as compared to the prior fiscal year  and as a percentage of revenue increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal we believe that the adoption of vertical design products and model based design products by our customers in all industries will increase their productivity and the value of their design data 
expanding our geographic coverage is another key element of our growth strategy 
while emerging markets are important for all global businesses  we believe they hold special opportunity for autodesk 
much of the growth in the world s construction and manufacturing is happening in emerging markets 
further  emerging markets face many of the challenges that our design technology can help address  for example infrastructure build out 
we believe that emerging economies continue to present long term growth opportunities for us and revenue from emerging countries increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal revenue from emerging countries represented of both fiscal and fiscal net revenue 
while we believe there are long term growth opportunities in emerging economies  conducting business in these countries presents significant challenges  including economic volatility  geopolitical risk  local competition  intellectual property protection  poorly developed business infrastructure  scarcity of talent and software piracy 
our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products  technology and businesses 
acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers  however  they entail cost 
table of contents and integration challenges and may  in certain instances  negatively impact our operating margins 
we continually review these trade offs in making decisions regarding acquisitions 
we currently anticipate that we will acquire products  technology and businesses as compelling opportunities that promote our strategy become available 
the pace at which we make such investments will vary depending upon our business needs  the availability of suitable sellers and technology  and our own financial condition 
our strategy depends upon a number of assumptions  including that we will be able to continue making our technology available to mainstream markets  leverage our large global network of distributors  resellers  third party developers  customers  educational institutions  and students  improve the performance and functionality of our products  and adequately protect our intellectual property 
if the outcome of any of these assumptions differs from our expectations  we may not be able to implement our strategy  which could potentially adversely affect our business 
for further discussion regarding these and related risks see part i  item a  risk factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we regularly reevaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note  business and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that of all our significant accounting policies  the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
however  determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
for multiple element arrangements that include software products  we allocate the sales price among each of the deliverables using the residual method  under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on their vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
vsoe is the price charged when an element is sold separately or a price set by management with the relevant authority 
if we do not have vsoe of an undelivered software license  we defer revenue recognition on the entire sales arrangement until all elements for which we do not have vsoe are delivered 
if we do not have vsoe for undelivered maintenance or services  the revenue for the arrangement is recognized over the longest contractual period in the arrangement 
we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent 
our assessment of likelihood of collection is also a critical factor in determining the timing of revenue recognition 
if we do not believe that collection is probable  the revenue will be deferred until the earlier of when collection is deemed probable or payment is received 
our indirect channel model includes both a two tiered distribution structure  where distributors sell to resellers  and a one tiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers 
our product license revenue from distributors and resellers are generally recognized at the time title to our product passes to the distributor  in a two tiered structure  or reseller  in a one tiered structure  provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met 
this policy is predicated on our ability to estimate sales returns  among other criteria 
we are also required to evaluate whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to make fixed or 
table of contents determinable payments  regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers 
our policy also presumes that we have no significant performance obligations in connection with the sale of our product licenses by our distributors and resellers to their customers 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
marketable securities 
at january  we had million of short and long term marketable securities 
marketable securities are stated at fair value 
as described in note  fair value measurements  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we estimate the fair value of our marketable securities each quarter 
fair value is defined as an exit price  representing the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
when identical or similar assets are traded in active markets  the level of judgment required to estimate their fair value is relatively low 
this is generally true for our cash and cash equivalents and the majority of our marketable securities  which we consider to be level assets and level assets 
however  determining the fair value of marketable securities when observable inputs are not available level requires significant judgment 
for example we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of our auction rate securities  because we have determined that the market for those securities is inactive 
this determination is based on the fact that due to a decrease in liquidity in the global credit markets  the regularly scheduled auctions for the auction rate securities we hold have generally failed since august these assumptions are inherently subjective and involve significant management judgment 
whenever possible  we use observable market data and rely on unobservable inputs only when observable market data is not available  when determining fair value 
business combinations 
we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to assets and liabilities  as well as to in process research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
the purchase price allocation process requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates used in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from sales  maintenance agreements and acquired developed technologies  the acquired company s trade name and customer relationships as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and customer relationships will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  and discount rates 
goodwill 
we test goodwill for impairment annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment 
when assessing goodwill for impairment  we use discounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows 
variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether goodwill is impaired  or the amount of any impairment charge 
impairment charges  if any  result from instances where the fair values of net assets associated with goodwill are less than their carrying values 
as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur  we may be required to record impairment charges 
as of january   a hypothetical decrease in the fair value of our reporting units would not have an impact on the carrying value of goodwill  nor result in impairment of goodwill 
for further discussion see note  business and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
realizability of long lived assets 
we assess the realizability of our long lived assets and related intangible assets  other than goodwill  annually during the fourth fiscal quarter  or sooner should events or 
table of contents changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable 
we consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review significant under performance of a business or product line relative to budget  shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets  significant negative industry or economic trends  and the results of past impairment reviews 
in assessing the recoverability of these long lived assets  we first determine their fair values  which are based on assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows that could reasonably be generated by these assets 
if impairment indicators were present based on our undiscounted cash flow models  which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows  we would discount the cash flows to assess impairments on long lived assets 
variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge 
impairment charges  if any  result in situations where any fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values 
in addition to our recoverability assessments  we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our long lived assets 
any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made  as well as in subsequent quarters 
we will continue to evaluate the values of our long lived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules 
as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur  we may be required to record impairment charges 
income taxes 
we currently have million of net deferred tax assets  primarily a result of tax credits  net operating losses  and timing differences for reserves  accrued liabilities  stock options  purchased technologies and capitalized intangibles  partially offset by the establishment of us deferred tax liabilities on unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries  deferred tax liabilities associated with tax method change on advanced payments and valuation allowances against california and canadian deferred tax assets 
we perform a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets and believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize the net deferred tax assets 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions and other factors 
any change in future profitability may require material adjustments to these net deferred tax assets  resulting in a reduction in net income in the period when such determination is made 
stock based compensation 
we measure stock based compensation cost at the grant date fair value of the award  and recognize expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we estimate the fair value of stock based payment awards using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of a stock based award on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the award  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the award and expected dividends 
the variables used in the model are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted  as needed 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
legal contingencies 
as described in part i  item  legal proceedings and part ii  item  note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings 
we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we record a liability for the estimated loss 
because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters  we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates 
such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations

overview of fiscal results of operations fiscal year ended january  as a of net revenue fiscal year ended january  as a of net revenue in millions net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses income from operations our results for fiscal reflect recent improvements in global demand  as compared to the prior fiscal year when the economic downturn had decreased demand for our products and services  and customers reduced their workforces 
while some global macroeconomic indicators improved during fiscal  unemployment remains high in several important geographies  including the us additionally  there are a number of mixed data points as to whether credit has become more readily available  and it is unclear whether and how the availability of credit continues to impact our customers and partners 
our business grew year over year as evidenced by our increases in revenue  gross profit and income from operations 
during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  net revenue increase  gross profit increased and income from operations increased 
contributing to the year over year increases in revenue were increases in revenue from new seat licenses  maintenance revenue  revenue for most of our major products  all of our reportable segments  and all of our geographies during fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year 
in addition  we continued to make progress in controlling our operating costs  which led to year over year improvements in profitability 
the increase in income from operations in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due to the increase in our net revenue  while holding the growth of operating expenses 
the majority of our costs are relatively fixed in the short term as they relate primarily to our workforce 
in fiscal we were able to grow our net revenue without significantly increasing our workforce 
we believe that the improvements in these areas are indications that our business stabilized and is beginning to grow 
our total operating margin increased from million  or of revenue during fiscal to million  or of revenue during fiscal the increase in our operating margin during fiscal was primarily due to net revenue increasing more rapidly than the increase in our costs due to our cost saving initiatives during fiscal and net revenue increased million or for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  while our operating expenses increased million  or for fiscal the increase in operating expenses in fiscal  as compared to fiscal was due to performance based compensation related to higher company performance  the return of employee costs which were temporarily suppressed in the prior year such as  salary reductions  employee incentives and mandatory vacation  and other costs associated with higher revenue 
these increases were partially offset by the decrease in restructuring charges of million  the decrease in goodwill impairment charges of million and the decrease in stock based compensation charges of million 
we believe net revenue for fiscal will increase by approximately compared to fiscal we anticipate fiscal operating margin will increase by approximately basis points compared to fiscal net revenue from japan was million  or approximately of our net revenue  for the fiscal year ended january  the earthquake and tsunami that struck japan in march has created uncertainty  which may impact our future financial results 

table of contents we generate a significant amount of our revenue in the us  japan  germany  france  the united kingdom  canada  italy  south korea  australia and belgium 
included in the overall increase in revenue were impacts associated with foreign currency 
our revenue benefited from foreign exchange rate changes during fiscal  as compared to fiscal had applicable exchange rates from fiscal been in effect during fiscal and had we excluded foreign exchange hedge gains and losses from fiscal  on a constant currency basis  net revenue would have increased compared to the prior fiscal year 
operating expenses during fiscal year increased compared to the prior fiscal year as reported and increased on a constant currency basis 
changes in the value of the us dollar may have a significant effect on net revenue  operating expenses and income from operations in future periods 
we use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate effect on a portion of the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions  but do not attempt to completely mitigate the impact of fluctuation of such foreign currency against the us dollar 
we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions  including tech data corporation and its global affiliates collectively  tech data 
tech data accounted for and of our consolidated net revenue during fiscal year and  respectively 
we believe our business is not substantially dependent on tech data 
our actual customers through tech data are the resellers and end users who purchase our software licenses and services 
should any of the agreements between us and tech data be terminated for any reason  we believe that arrangements could be made so that the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through tech data would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to us 
our primary goals for fiscal are to grow revenue and improve operating margin percentage by delivering our market leading products and solutions to our customers and investing in product functionality and new product lines  including suites offerings 
however  there can be no assurance that we will achieve our financial goals and improve our financial results 
at january   we had  million in cash and marketable securities 
we completed fiscal with a higher deferred revenue balance and a higher accounts receivable balance as compared to fiscal our deferred revenue balance at january  included million of customer maintenance contracts  which will be recognized as revenue ratably over the life of the contracts  which is predominantly one year  but may be two or three year  or occasionally as long as five year terms 
we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million during fiscal comparatively  we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million during fiscal 
table of contents results of operations net revenue fiscal year ended january  increase decrease compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  increase decrease compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  in millions net revenue license and other maintenance net revenue by geographic area americas europe  middle east and africa asia pacific net revenue by operating segment platform solutions and emerging business architecture  engineering and construction manufacturing media and entertainment other fiscal net revenue compared to fiscal net revenue license and other revenue license and other revenue is comprised of two components all forms of product license revenue and other revenue 
product license revenue includes revenue from the sale of new seat licenses  upgrades and crossgrades 
other revenue consists of revenue from creative finishing  consulting and training services  collaborative project management services  and our former location services division 
we divested the location services division in february total license and other revenue increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal license and other revenue from horizontal design and vertical design products increased and license and other revenue from model based design products increased  each as compared to the prior fiscal year 
these increases were primarily due to the increase in commercial new seat revenue during fiscal as compared to fiscal during fiscal  percentage points of the increase was due to the increase in the number of seats sold  and percentage points was due to higher average net revenue per seat 
commercial new seat revenue  as a percentage of license and other revenue  was and for fiscal and  respectively 
also contributing to the increase in license and other revenue during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was the increase in upgrade revenue  which includes crossgrade revenue 
upgrade revenue was higher during fiscal primarily due to a one time increase in upgrades in response to a promotion in advance of the march increase in upgrade pricing  an additional promotion run in the americas geography in the fourth quarter and an increase in the number of larger revenue transactions in fiscal as compared to fiscal 
table of contents revenue from the sales of our services  training and support  included in license and other revenue  represented less than of net revenue for all periods presented 
maintenance revenue our maintenance revenue relates to a program known by our user community as the subscription program 
our maintenance program provides our commercial and educational customers with a cost effective and predictable budgetary option to obtain the productivity benefits of our new releases and enhancements when and if released during the term of their contracts 
under our maintenance program  customers are eligible to receive unspecified upgrades when and if available  downloadable training courses and online support 
we recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the maintenance contract periods 
maintenance revenue increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a increase in commercial maintenance revenue 
total subscription program enrollment at january  and consisted of about million users and million users  respectively 
the increase in commercial maintenance revenue was due to a percentage point increase in net revenue per maintenance seat and a percentage point increase in commercial enrollment during the corresponding maintenance contract term 
commercial maintenance revenue represented of maintenance revenue for both fiscal and changes in maintenance revenue lag changes in net billings for maintenance contracts because we recognize the revenue from those contracts ratably over their contract terms  which are predominantly one year  but may be two or three year  or occasionally as long as five year terms 
net maintenance billings increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was due to an increase in renewals  more new seats sold and the impact from the upgrade pricing promotion mentioned above 
aggregate backlog at january  and january  was million and million  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  represented deferred revenue 
backlog related to current software license product orders that had not shipped at the end of the quarter increased by million during fiscal from million at january  to million at january  deferred revenue consists primarily of deferred maintenance revenue 
to a lesser extent  deferred revenue consists of deferred license and other revenue derived from collaborative project management services  consulting services and deferred license sales 
backlog from current software license product orders that we have not yet shipped consists of orders for currently available licensed software products from customers with approved credit status and may include orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period 
net revenue by geographic area net revenue in the americas geography increased by both as reported and on a constant currency basis  during fiscal  as compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to a increase in revenue from new seats in the americas during fiscal as compared to fiscal maintenance revenue increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal the americas was affected by slower economic growth than our other geographies  which impacted growth rates for all of our products during fiscal net revenue in the emea geography increased by  or on a constant currency basis  during fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to a increase in new seat revenue and a increase in maintenance revenue 
the emea geography s increase in revenue during fiscal was primarily due to economic expansion in virtually all countries in that geography 
the increase in our revenue in that geography was led by germany  france  the united kingdom and belgium 
net revenue in the apac geography increased by  or on a constant currency basis  during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a increase in new seat revenue and a increase in 
table of contents upgrade revenue 
net revenue expansion in the apac geography during fiscal occurred in virtually all countries  led by japan and followed by south korea  australia and india 
net revenue in emerging economies increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to revenue from china  the russian federation  india  brazil and poland 
this growth was a significant factor in our international sales growth during fiscal revenue from emerging economies represented of net revenue for both fiscal and we believe that international revenue will continue to comprise a majority of our total net revenue 
the economic conditions in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue may have an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance 
changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies have significantly affected  and could continue to significantly affect  our financial results for a given period even though we hedge a portion of our current and projected revenue 
international net revenue represented of our net revenue in fiscal and of our net revenue in fiscal we remain cautious regarding our financial prospects primarily due the uncertainty surrounding the sustainability of the global economic recovery 
net revenue by operating segment we have four reportable segments platform solutions and emerging business pseb  architecture  engineering and construction aec  manufacturing mfg and media and entertainment m e 
location services  which we disposed of in february  is not included in any of the above reportable segments and is reflected as other 
we have no material inter segment revenue 
net revenue for pseb increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a increase in revenue from both our autocad and autocad lt products  offset by a net decrease in revenue from all other pseb products and services 
net revenue for aec increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a increase in revenue from our revit products  a increase in revenue from our autocad civil d products  and a increase in revenue from our navisworks products 
net revenue for mfg increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a increase in revenue from our autodesk inventor products and a increase in our autocad mechanical products 
net revenue for m e increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a increase in revenue from our animation product group and a increase in revenue from creative finishing 
the increase in animation revenue was primarily due to a increase in revenue from autodesk ds max 
fiscal net revenue compared to fiscal net revenue license and other revenue total license and other revenue decreased during fiscal as compared to fiscal license and other revenue from horizontal design and vertical design products decreased and license and other revenue from model based design products decreased  each as compared to the prior fiscal year 
these decreases were primarily due to the decrease in commercial new seat revenue during fiscal as compared to fiscal during fiscal  percentage points of the decrease was due to decreases in the number of seats sold  and percentage points was due to lower average net revenue per seat 
commercial new seat revenue  as a percentage of license and other revenue  was and for fiscal and  respectively 
also contributing to the decrease in license and other revenue during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was the decrease in upgrade revenue  which includes crossgrade revenue 
the decrease in upgrade revenue 
table of contents was driven primarily by the global economic contraction 
additionally  upgrade revenue was lower during fiscal because of the relatively smaller size of the upgradeable base of our autocad based products  as compared to the upgradeable base of our autocad based products during fiscal  due to a higher percentage of customers on our maintenance program  which includes unspecified upgrades when and if available 
maintenance revenue maintenance revenue increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a increase in commercial maintenance revenue 
the increase in commercial maintenance revenue was due to percentage points from higher net revenue per maintenance seat  partially offset by percentage points from lower program enrollment due to the economic downturn 
our increase in maintenance revenue in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  reflects an increase in maintenance billings in fiscal as compared to fiscal  partially offset by a decline in maintenance billings in fiscal as compared to fiscal the number of users increased from million at january  to million at january  primarily due to a one time adjustment of million educational seats for users who were migrated to a standard educational maintenance plan during the second fiscal quarter ended july  these users were not previously captured in our maintenance installed base prior to the second quarter of fiscal maintenance billings declined in fiscal  as compared to fiscal this decrease was due to fewer new seats sold and a decrease in renewal rates as customers reduced their work force 
the year over year growth in billings for maintenance contracts began to slow in the second quarter of fiscal  although maintenance billings increased slightly in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal the year over year decrease in maintenance billings caused downward pressure on maintenance revenue during subsequent years 
net revenue by geographic area net revenue in the americas geography decreased by both as reported and on a constant currency basis  during fiscal  as compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in revenue from new seats  partially offset by a increase in upgrade revenue in the americas during fiscal as compared to fiscal maintenance revenue growth was flat in fiscal as compared to fiscal growth in the americas was affected by economic volatility that impacted growth rates for all of our products during fiscal net revenue in the emea geography decreased by  or on a constant currency basis  during fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in new seat revenue and a decrease in revenue from upgrades 
these decreases were partially offset by a increase in maintenance revenue in emea during fiscal as compared to fiscal the emea geography s decline in revenue during fiscal was primarily due to economic contraction in virtually all countries in that geography 
the decrease in our revenue in that geography was led by emerging economy countries followed by germany  france  italy and the united kingdom 
the negative effect of the stronger value of the us dollar relative to the euro  the british pound and other european currencies also contributed to the decrease in net revenue in emea 
net revenue in the apac geography decreased by  or on a constant currency basis  during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in new seat revenue and a decrease in upgrade revenue 
these decreases were partially offset by a increase in maintenance revenue 
net revenue contraction in the apac geography during fiscal occurred in virtually all countries  led by japan and followed by china  south korea  india and australia 
revenue from emerging economies decreased during fiscal as compared to fiscal revenue from emerging economies represented and of net revenue during fiscal and  respectively 
this decrease contributed to our international sales contraction during fiscal 
table of contents international net revenue represented of our net revenue in fiscal and of our net revenue in fiscal we started to experience some economic difficulty in international sales in the third quarter of fiscal global conditions worsened  and the economic downturn significantly impacted our international sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal  particularly the robust business we had been seeing in emerging economies 
the economic contractions in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue had an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance in fiscal net revenue by operating segment net revenue for pseb decreased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in revenue from our autocad lt products and a decrease in revenue from our autocad products  offset by a net increase in revenue from all other pseb products and services 
net revenue for aec decreased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in revenue from our revit products  a decrease in revenue from our autocad architecture products  a decrease in revenue from our autocad civil d products and a net decrease in revenue from all other aec products and services 
net revenue for mfg decreased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in revenue from our autodesk inventor products and a decrease in revenue from our autodesk mechanical products  offset by a net increase in revenue from all other mfg products and services 
net revenue for m e decreased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in revenue from creative finishing and an decrease in revenue from our animation product group 
the decrease in animation revenue was primarily due to a decrease in revenue from autodesk ds max and a decrease in revenue from maya  offset by a net increase in revenue from all other m e products and services 
cost of revenue and operating expenses cost of revenue fiscal year ended january  increase decrease compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  increase decrease compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  in millions cost of revenue license and other maintenance as a percentage of net revenue cost of license and other revenue includes labor costs of order fulfillment and costs of fulfilling consulting and training services contracts and collaborative project management services contracts 
cost of license and other revenue also includes stock based compensation expense  direct material and overhead charges  amortization of purchased technology  professional services fees and royalties 
direct material and overhead charges include the cost of hardware sold mainly pc based workstations for creative finishing in the m e segment  costs associated with transferring our software to electronic media  printing of user manuals and packaging materials and shipping and handling costs 
during the first quarter of fiscal  autodesk reclassified certain costs of revenue  which primarily included reclassifying certain shipping and fulfillment expenses from cost of license and other revenue to 
table of contents cost of maintenance revenue  due to a change in our cost allocation methodology 
these expenses have been updated in the consolidated statements of operations  which include reclassifying million and million from cost of license to cost of maintenance revenue for fiscal years and  respectively 
see note  basis of presentation  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
cost of license and other revenue decreased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal primarily due to savings on shipping and handling costs caused by the switch to a lower cost vendor as well as an increase in electronic order fulfillment 
cost of license and other revenue decreased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal primarily due to the decrease in license and other revenue 
cost of license and other revenue did not decline as rapidly as the associated net revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal because of increased amortization of purchased technology related to fiscal years and acquisitions  costs associated with redundant services as we migrated a portion of our it systems onto a new platform  and higher costs associated with the implementation of our electronic fulfillment system 
cost of maintenance revenue includes labor costs of providing product support to our maintenance customers  including stock based compensation expense for these employees  rent and occupancy  shipping and handling costs and professional services fees 
cost of maintenance revenue increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to an increase in maintenance support headcount 
these increases were partially offset by savings on freight and materials costs as fewer maintenance customers require physical shipments than in the past due to electronic fulfillment 
cost of maintenance revenue increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to an increase in product support headcount due to the acquisition of moldflow corporation in the second quarter of fiscal cost of revenue  at least over the near term  is affected by the volume and mix of product sales  mix of physical versus electronic fulfillment  fluctuations in consulting costs  amortization of purchased technology  new customer support offerings  royalty rates for licensed technology embedded in our products  and employee stock based compensation expense 
we expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars  but to remain relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal  as compared to fiscal marketing and sales fiscal year ended january  increase compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  decrease compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  in millions marketing and sales as a percentage of net revenue marketing and sales expenses include salaries  bonuses  benefits  and stock based compensation expense for our marketing and sales employees  and the expense of travel  entertainment and training for such personnel  and the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue  such as advertising  trade shows and expositions  and various sales and promotional programs 
marketing and sales expenses also include labor costs of sales and order processing  sales and dealer commissions  rent and occupancy  and the cost of supplies and equipment 
marketing and sales expenses increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher employee related costs related to variable compensation  including commissions  bonuses and related fringe benefits 
variable compensation expenses increased as a result of exceeding our fiscal target revenue growth and operating margin growth targets more than we did in fiscal our annual incentive plans are based on forecasted revenue and operating margin  with current year targets set at the beginning of fiscal these increases were partially offset by the decrease in advertising and promotion spending and stock based compensation expense 
marketing and sales expenses decreased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to lower employee related costs  driven by decreased marketing and sales headcount and decreased travel expenditures and reduced advertising and promotional expenses 

table of contents we expect to balance our need to invest in the marketing and sales of our products with our desire to actively manage our sales and marketing operating expenses 
as a result  we expect marketing and sales expense to increase in absolute dollars  but to slightly decrease as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal  as compared to fiscal research and development fiscal year ended january  increase compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  decrease compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  in millions research and development as a percentage of net revenue research and development expenses  which are expensed as incurred  consist primarily of salaries  bonuses  benefits and stock based compensation expense for research and development employees  and the expense of travel  entertainment and training for such personnel  rent and occupancy  professional services such as fees paid to software development firms and independent contractors 
research and development expenses increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to an increase in bonuses  salaries and benefits 
research and development expenses decreased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to decreases in employee related costs driven by decreased research and development headcount 
also contributing to the decline was a decrease in acquisition related in process research and development charges from fiscal to fiscal we expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars  but remain relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  as we continue to invest in product development and acquire new technology in fiscal general and administrative fiscal year ended january  increase compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  decrease compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  in millions general and administrative as a percentage of net revenue general and administrative expenses include salaries  bonuses  benefits and stock based compensation expense for our finance  human resources and legal employees  and the expense of travel  entertainment and training for such personnel as well as professional fees for legal and accounting services  amortization of acquisition related customer relationships and trade names  expense of communication and the cost of supplies and equipment 
general and administrative expenses increased from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to an increase in bonuses and salaries partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense 
general and administrative expenses decreased from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to decreases in employee related costs driven by decreased general and administrative headcount and reduced rent and occupancy costs due to the consolidation of facilities 
this decrease was partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization related to capital expenditures from fiscal and we expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars  but remain consistent as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal  as compared to fiscal 
table of contents restructuring fiscal year ended january  decrease compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  increase compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  in millions restructuring as a percentage of net revenue in the first quarter of fiscal  we initiated a restructuring plan in order to reduce operating costs 
the restructuring plan resulted in targeted staff reductions of approximately positions 
no leased facilities were consolidated as part of this restructuring 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we initiated a restructuring program  which resulted in headcount reduction of approximately positions globally and resulted in the consolidation of approximately leased facilities around the world in order to reduce our operating expenses 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we initiated a restructuring program in order to reduce our operating costs 
this program reduced the number of employees by a total of approximately positions globally and resulted in the consolidation of approximately leased facilities 
in connection with these restructuring programs  we recorded restructuring related charges of million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
of these amounts  million  million and million were recorded for one time termination benefits and other costs during fiscal  and  respectively  and million and million were recorded for facilities related costs during fiscal and  respectively 
the one time termination benefits for these three restructuring programs have been substantially paid as of january  we expect to pay the facility related liabilities through fiscal see note  restructuring reserve  in notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
impairment of goodwill and intangibles fiscal year ended january  decrease compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  decrease compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  in millions impairment of goodwill and intangibles as a percentage of net revenue we did not record an impairment charge during fiscal during fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million representing the entire goodwill balance of our m e segment as of april  this goodwill balance related to our m e segment s fourth quarter fiscal acquisition of substantially all of the assets of softimage 
during fiscal we recorded a million impairment charge affecting the fourth quarter of fiscal  primarily related to impairment of goodwill associated with our m e segment 
should our revenue and cash flow projections decline significantly in the future  additional impairment charges may be recorded to goodwill 
as of january   a hypothetical decrease in the fair value of our reporting units would not have an impact on the carrying value of goodwill  nor result in impairment of goodwill

table of contents interest and other income  net the following table sets forth the components of interest and other income  net fiscal year ended january  in millions interest and investment income  net investment impairment gain loss on foreign currency other income interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  decreased million during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to foreign currency losses 
the loss on foreign currency in fiscal is primarily due to the impact of re measuring foreign currency transactions into the functional currency of the corresponding entity  partially offset by the gain on foreign currency derivatives not designated as hedging instruments 
interest and investment income  net  fluctuates based on average cash and marketable securities balances  average maturities and interest rates 
the increase in interest and investment income  net  during fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to the increase in interest income concurrent with the increase in our cash and marketable securities balance 
the increase in interest and other income  net  during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  is primarily due to gains on marketable securities  gains on foreign currency transactions  a gain on the sale of an investment and the impairment of an investment during fiscal these increases were partially offset by lower interest rate yields on investments during fiscal as compared to fiscal provision for income taxes we account for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse 
our effective tax rate was and during fiscal and  respectively 
our effective tax rate decreased percentage points from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to a change in expected future tax rates  the establishment of the california valuation allowance in fiscal and a decrease in non deductible stock based compensation expense  offset by a decrease in tax benefits from foreign earnings taxed at different rates in fiscal compared to fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  the state of california enacted legislation significantly altering california tax law 
as a result of the newly enacted legislation  we expect that in fiscal years and beyond  income subject to tax in california will be less than under prior tax law and accordingly  deferred tax assets are less likely to be realized 
our effective tax rate was and during fiscal and  respectively 
our effective tax rate increased percentage points from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to a change in expected future tax rates and the establishment of the california valuation allowance in fiscal offset by non deductible goodwill impairment and in process research and development expenses in fiscal our future effective tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits and charges from tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings that are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate  research credits  state income taxes  the tax impact of stock based compensation  accounting for uncertain tax positions  business combinations  us manufacturer s deduction  closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits  changes in valuation allowances and changes in tax law 

table of contents at january   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize these assets 
for additional information regarding our income tax provision  see note  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other financial information in addition to our results determined under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap discussed above  we believe the following non gaap measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance 
for the fiscal years ended january   and  our gross profit  gross margin  income from operations  operating margin  net income and diluted earnings per share on a gaap and non gaap basis were as follows in millions except for gross margin  operating margin and per share data january  january  january  unaudited gross profit non gaap gross profit gross margin non gaap gross margin income from operations non gaap income from operations operating margin non gaap operating margin net income non gaap net income diluted earnings per share non gaap diluted earnings per share for our internal budgeting and resource allocation process  we use non gaap measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis 
these non gaap measures do not include certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results 
we use non gaap measures in making operating decisions because we believe those measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our earning potential 
in addition  these non gaap financial measures facilitate comparisons to our and our competitors historical results and operating guidance 
we also use these measures for purposes of determining company wide incentive compensation 
there are limitations in using non gaap financial measures because non gaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different from non gaap financial measures used by other companies 
the non gaap financial measures included above are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results 
in addition  they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which charges are excluded from the non gaap financial measures 
we compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a gaap basis as well as a non gaap basis and also by providing gaap measures in our public disclosures 
the presentation of non gaap financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap 
the non gaap financial measures are meant to supplement  and be viewed in conjunction with  gaap financial measures 
we urge investors to review the reconciliation of our non gaap financial measures to the comparable gaap financial measures included below  and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business

table of contents our non gaap financial measures as set forth in the table above exclude the following stock based compensation expenses 
we exclude stock based compensation expenses from non gaap measures primarily because they are non cash expenses and management finds it useful to exclude certain non cash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting  planning and forecasting future periods 
amortization of purchased intangibles and in process research and development expenses 
we incur amortization of acquisition related purchased intangible assets and charges related to in process research and development primarily in connection with acquisitions of certain businesses and technologies 
the amortization of purchased intangibles varies depending on the level of acquisition activity  and management finds it useful to exclude these variable charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting  planning and forecasting future periods 
goodwill impairment 
this is a non cash charge to write down goodwill to fair value when there was an indication that the asset was impaired 
as explained above  management finds it useful to exclude certain non cash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting  planning and forecasting future periods 
restructuring charges 
these expenses are associated with realigning our business strategies based on current economic conditions 
in connection with these restructuring actions  we recognize costs related to termination benefits for former employees whose positions were eliminated  and the closure of facilities and cancelation of certain contracts 
we exclude these charges because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing financial results in the current period 
establishment of a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets 
this is a non cash charge to record a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets 
as explained above  management finds it useful to exclude certain non cash charges to assess the appropriate level of various expenses to assist in budgeting  planning and forecasting future periods 
discrete tax items 
we exclude the gaap tax provision  including discrete items  from the non gaap measure of income  and include a non gaap tax provision based upon the projected annual non gaap effective tax rate 
management believes this approach assists investors in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations 
income tax effects on the difference between gaap and non gaap costs and expenses 
the income tax effects that are excluded from the non gaap measures relate to the tax impact on the difference between gaap and non gaap costs and expenses  primarily due to differences in the timing of when income tax benefits are recognized for stock compensation and purchased intangibles for gaap and non gaap measures 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of cash is from the sale of licenses to our products 
our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs which consist primarily of employee related expenses  such as compensation and benefits  as well as general operating expenses for marketing  facilities and overhead costs 
in addition to operating expenses  we also use cash to invest in our growth initiatives  which include acquisitions of products  technology and businesses and to fund our stock repurchase program 
see further discussion of these items below 
at january   our principal sources of liquidity were cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling  million and net accounts receivable of million 
in addition  we have a us line of credit facility that permits unsecured short term borrowings of up to million 
this line of credit agreement contains customary covenants that could restrict the imposition of liens on our assets  and restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or make dispositions of assets if we fail to maintain the financial covenants 
this 
table of contents credit facility is available for working capital and other business needs 
the us line of credit expires in august in addition to the u 
s line of credit  we had a million china line of credit that was terminated during the second quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we had no borrowings or repayments on either of our line of credit facilities 
at the beginning of fiscal we had million outstanding on our us and china line of credit facilities 
during fiscal  we borrowed million under our credit facilities for a total outstanding balance of million  all of which we repaid in fiscal as of january  and  there were no borrowings outstanding under the us and china line of credit facilities 
our cash and cash equivalents are held by diversified financial institutions globally 
our primary commercial banking relationship is with citibank and its global affiliates citibank 
in addition  citicorp usa  inc  an affiliate of citibank  is the lead lender and agent in the syndicate of our million us line of credit 
the increase in our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities from  million at january  to  million at january  is principally the result of cash generated from operations and the proceeds from the issuance of common stock following stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases 
these increases to cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were partially offset by cash used for repurchases of our common stock  capital expenditures  and cash used for business combinations and other investing activities 
cash generated from operations was positively impacted by higher net revenue 
the primary source for net cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal was net income of million increased by the effect of non cash expenses totaling million associated with depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation 
in addition  net cash flow provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities was million 
the primary source of working capital was an increase in deferred revenue due to higher maintenance billings for fiscal compared to fiscal the primary working capital uses of cash were increases in accounts receivable due to higher billings in fiscal compared to fiscal and an increase in prepaid and other assets 
at january   our short term investment portfolio had an estimated fair value of million and a cost basis of million 
the portfolio fair value consisted of million invested in commercial paper and corporate securities  million invested in us government agency securities  million invested in mutual funds  million invested in certificates of deposit and time deposits with remaining maturities at the date of purchase greater than days and less than one year  million invested in u 
s treasury securities  million invested in sovereign debt  million invested in municipal securities and million invested in other short term securities 
at january   autodesk was invested in the reserve international liquidity fund the international fund with an estimated fair value of million 
in mid september of  the international fund ceased redemptions after net asset values of the funds decreased below per share 
this occurred as a result of the international fund revaluing their holdings of debt securities issued by lehman brothers holdings  inc lehman brothers  which filed for chapter bankruptcy on september   and the resulting unusually high redemption requests on the international fund 
a third party court supervisor was appointed to oversee the accounting and payment administration of the international fund 
on november  a judge entered an order accepting a settlement agreement directing the distribution of the remaining funds 
on january   we received substantially all of our holdings from the international fund 
at january   million of trading securities were invested in a defined set of mutual funds as directed by the participants in our deferred compensation plan see note  deferred compensation  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
long term cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the following stock repurchases  the acquisition of businesses  software products  or technologies complementary to 
table of contents our business  capital expenditures  including the purchase and implementation of internal use software applications  and funding restructuring costs 
our cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances are concentrated in a few locations around the world  with a substantial amount held outside of the us we believe that such dispersion is appropriate and meets our business and liquidity needs 
a portion of this cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities could be subject to certain taxes  including us income taxes  in the event we believe repatriation to the us is appropriate 
our existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances may decline in fiscal in the event of a weakening of the global economy or changes in our planned cash outlay 
cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to the risks detailed in part i  item a titled risk factors 
however  based on our current business plan and revenue prospects  we believe that our existing balances  our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next months 
our existing us credit facility is currently million of which we have no amounts outstanding 
this credit facility is available for working capital and other business needs 
our revenue  earnings  cash flows  receivables and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency contracts to manage our exposure to foreign currency volatility that exists as part of our ongoing business operations 
we utilize cash flow hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on a portion of the net revenue or operating expense of certain anticipated transactions 
in addition  we use balance sheet hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with foreign currency denominated receivables and payables 
as of january  and  we had open cash flow and balance sheet hedge contracts with future settlements within one to twelve months 
contracts were primarily denominated in euros  japanese yen  swiss francs  british pounds and canadian dollars 
we do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the notional amount of our option and forward contracts was million and million at january  and  respectively 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant financial contractual obligations at january  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
total fiscal year fiscal years fiscal years thereafter in millions operating lease obligations purchase obligations deferred compensation obligations pension obligations other obligations total other obligations include future sabbatical obligations and asset retirement obligations 
this table generally excludes amounts already recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities  certain purchase obligations as discussed below  long term deferred revenue and amounts related to income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions  since we cannot predict with reasonable reliability the timing of cash settlements to the respective taxing authorities see note income taxes to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents operating lease obligations consist primarily of obligations for facilities  net of sublease income  computer equipment and other equipment leases 
purchase obligations are contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on autodesk and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations relate primarily to hosting services agreements  it infrastructure costs  marketing costs and contractual software development services 
deferred compensation obligations relate to amounts held in a rabbi trust under our non qualified deferred compensation plan 
see note deferred compensation  in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this plan 
pension obligations relate to our obligations for pension plans outside of the us see note  retirement benefit plans  in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these obligations 
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
in addition  we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products 
royalty expense is generally based on the number of units shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue 
royalty expense  included in cost of license and other revenue  was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
we provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees  including limited product warranties 
historically  costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant  but because potential future costs are highly variable  we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations 
issuer purchases of equity securities our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the cumulative repurchase of up to million shares 
the purpose of the stock repurchase program is largely to help offset the dilution to net income per share caused by the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans and for such other purposes as may be in the interests of autodesk and its stockholders  and has the effect of returning excess cash generated from our business to stockholders 
the number of shares acquired and the timing of the purchases are based on several factors  including general market conditions  the volume of employee stock option exercises  the trading price of our common stock  cash on hand and available in the us  and company defined trading windows 
there were million repurchases of our common stock during the three months ended january   during the year ended january  we repurchased million shares of our common stock 
at january   million shares remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization 
this program does not have a fixed expiration date 
see note  stockholder equity  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases  we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements or have any variable interest entities 
as of january  we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our revenue  earnings  cash flows  receivables and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency contracts to manage our exposure to foreign currency volatility that exists as part of our ongoing business operations

the notional amount of our option and forward contracts was million and million at january  and  respectively 
we utilize foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on the net revenue and operating expenses of certain anticipated transactions 
a sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of january  indicated that a hypothetical appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january  and would increase the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by million and million  respectively 
a hypothetical depreciation of the dollar from its value at january  and would decrease the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by million and million  respectively 
interest rate risk interest rate movements affect both the interest income we earn on our short term investments and  to a lesser extent  the market value of certain longer term securities 
at january   we had  million of cash equivalents and marketable securities 
with an average cash equivalent investment balance for the quarter of approximately million  if interest rates were to increase decrease by  this would result in a million increase decrease in annual interest income 
further  at january   we had approximately million invested in a longer term portfolio with remaining maturities that may be less than one year which  with and basis point moves  would result in market value changes gains or losses of million and million respectively  over a twelve month period 
at january   we had million of cash equivalents and marketable securities 
with an average investment balance for the quarter of approximately million  if interest rates were to increase decrease by  this would result in a million increase decrease in annual interest income 
further  at january   we had approximately million invested in a longer term portfolio which  with and basis point moves  would result in market value changes gains or losses of million over both six and month periods 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk
