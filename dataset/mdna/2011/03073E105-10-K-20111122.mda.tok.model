amerisourcebergen corporation summary financial information vs 
vs 
fiscal year ended september  dollars in thousands change change revenue gross profit operating income percentages of revenue gross profit operating expenses operating income year ended september  compared with year ended september  operating results revenue of billion in fiscal increased from the prior fiscal year 
the increase in revenue was due to the growth of abdc  offset in part by the revenue decline of absg 
during fiscal  of revenue was from sales to institutional customers and was from sales to retail customers  this compared to a customer mix in fiscal of institutional and retail 
sales to institutional customers increased in the current fiscal year and sales to retail customers increased in the current fiscal year 
abdc s revenue increased from the prior fiscal year due to overall pharmaceutical market growth and the above market growth of a few of our largest customers  primarily our institutional customers 
absg s revenue of billion in fiscal decreased by from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the september discontinuance of its contract with a third party logistics customer that transitioned to a direct manufacturer distribution model 
absg s revenue decline in the fiscal year ended september  was also attributable to a decline in sales to dialysis providers  and a shift in product mix to more generic pharmaceuticals 
the majority of absg s revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states  especially oncology 
absg s business may be adversely impacted in the future by changes in medical guidelines and the medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals  especially oncology drugs  administered by physicians and anemia drugs 
since absg provides a number of services to or through physicians  any changes affecting this service channel could result in slower growth or reduced revenues 

table of contents we currently expect our revenue growth in fiscal to be relatively flat or to grow modestly in comparison to fiscal we expect a significant number of brand to generic drug conversions in fiscal and one of our larger retail customers  the former long s drugs  with annual revenue totaling billion  was previously acquired by a customer of one of our competitors and did not renew its contract 
as a result  we will no longer service this large customer after september  our expected growth reflects us pharmaceutical industry conditions  including increases in prescription drug utilization  the introduction of new products  and higher branded pharmaceutical prices  offset  in part  by the increased use of lower priced generics 
our growth also may be impacted  among other things  by industry competition and changes in customer mix 
in july  our largest customer  medco health solutions  inc medco  which accounted for of our revenue in fiscal  announced its intention to merge with express scripts  inc  which will be the surviving corporation and is a customer of one of our competitors 
our business with medco contributes approximately of our earnings 
our current contract with medco continues at least through march we will make every effort to extend our relationship with the combined entity upon the expiration of our current contract  however  if we fail to do so  our revenue  earnings and cash flows would be significantly impacted 
our future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors such as industry growth trends  including the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers  general economic conditions in the united states  competition within the industry  customer consolidation  changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices  increased downward pressure on government and other third party reimbursement rates to our customers  and changes in federal government rules and regulations 
gross profit of billion in fiscal increased million or from the prior fiscal year 
the increase was greater than our revenue growth in large part due to the specialty generic product introductions launches  the continued strong growth and profitability of our non specialty generic programs and increased contributions from our fee for service agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers 
all of the above was offset in part by normal competitive pressures on customer margins 
oxaliplatin  gemcitabine  and docetaxel all generic oncology drugs  were launched in the quarters ended september   december   and march   respectively 
the gross profit benefit achieved collectively from all three generic oncology drugs in the fiscal year ended september  was higher than the benefit achieved from oxaliplatin alone in the prior fiscal year by approximately million 
sales of oxaliplatin  the largest contributor of the three specialty generic drugs  benefited our gross profit by approximately million and million in the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
we fully depleted our inventory of this product in fiscal further quantities of oxaliplatin are not expected to be available until the product is re launched in august beginning in our fourth quarter ended september   the gross profit contributions from sales of gemcitabine and docetaxel began to moderate as additional pharmaceutical manufacturers offered these products for sale and as third party reimbursement rates to our customers declined 
additionally  we expect the gross profit contributions from the sales of gemcitabine and docetaxel to be significantly lower in fiscal in comparison to fiscal in fiscal  we expect the gross profit decline from the above mentioned three specialty generic products will be substantially offset by the expected gross profit contribution from the over abdc brand to generic product conversions that are anticipated to occur 
however  there are unique circumstances surrounding the launch of each generic product and the actual gross profit from these launches can differ materially from what we expect 
in the current fiscal year  we recognized a gain of million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers 
this compared to a recognized gain of million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers in the prior fiscal year 
these gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold 
we are unable to estimate future gains  if any  that we will recognize as a result of antitrust settlements see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
lastly  in fiscal  we completed a reconciliation with one of our generic suppliers relating to rebate incentives owed to us 
our gross profit benefited by approximately million in fiscal as a result of having completed this reconciliation 
as a percentage of revenue  our gross profit margin of in fiscal improved basis points from the prior fiscal year 
the gross profit margin improvement was due to the above mentioned generic oncology drug launches  the strong growth and profitability of our non specialty generic programs and increased contributions from our fee for service agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers 
these factors more than offset the above market growth of some of our largest customers  who benefit from our best pricing  and normal competitive pressures on customer margins 
additionally  the gain on antitrust litigation settlements  as noted above  contributed basis points to our gross profit margin in fiscal our cost of goods sold includes a last in  first out lifo provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities  product mix  and manufacturer pricing practices  which may be impacted by market and other external influences 
we recorded a lifo charge of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  we started to incur significant costs to support our new erp system as we began the transition of our legacy information systems to our new erp system 
the incremental costs of maintaining dual information technology platforms  including depreciation  are estimated to be million per year during the transition period 
additionally  in fiscal  abdc implemented its energiz program  which encompasses a number of initiatives to maximize salesforce productivity  improve customer contractual compliance  and drive efficiency by linking our information technology capabilities more effectively with our operations 

table of contents operating expenses of billion in fiscal increased million or from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the incremental costs of maintaining dual information technology platforms including depreciation  an increase in consulting expenses related to abdc s energiz program  and an increase in employee severance  litigation and other costs 
in fiscal  we incurred severance costs of million related to our energiz program  we recorded a million charge related to the preliminary qui tam settlement the qui tam matter as described in note legal matters and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we incurred million of costs related to business acquisitions  and we incurred a million charge related to intangible asset impairments 
in the prior fiscal year  asset impairment charges included a write off of capitalized software of million included within distribution  selling and administrative expenses and intangible asset impairment charges of million 
additionally  the prior fiscal year benefited from the reversal of a million legal accrual 
as a percentage of revenue  operating expenses were in fiscal  and increased by basis points from the prior fiscal year due to the same matters as noted above and was offset  in part  by our operating leverage  particularly within abdc 
operating income of billion in fiscal increased million or from the prior fiscal year due to the increase in our gross profit 
as a percentage of revenue  operating income increased basis points to in fiscal due to the increase in our gross profit margin  offset in part by the increase in our operating expense margin 
the net impact of the gain on antitrust litigation settlements  the costs relating to employee severance  litigation and other  and the asset impairments decreased operating income as a percentage of revenue by basis points in fiscal and increased operating income as a percentage of revenue by basis points in fiscal other income of million in fiscal primarily related to a gain resulting from payments received in excess of amounts accrued on a note receivable relating to a prior business disposition 
other loss of million in fiscal primarily related to a loss incurred on an equity investment 
interest expense  interest income  and the respective weighted average interest rates in fiscal and were as follows in thousands weighted average weighted average amount interest rate amount interest rate interest expense interest income interest expense  net interest expense increased from the prior fiscal year due to an increase in the weighted average interest rate and a decline in interest costs capitalized relating to our business transformation project 
interest costs capitalized have the effect of reducing interest expense and were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
interest income decreased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average interest rate and an increase in the amount of cash held in non interest bearing cash accounts 
our interest expense in future periods may vary significantly depending upon changes in net borrowings  interest rates  amendments to our current borrowing facilities  and strategic decisions to deploy our invested cash 
we expect our interest expense to be significantly higher in fiscal primarily due to the november issuance of our senior notes due  as described further within liquidity and capital resources 
income taxes in fiscal reflect an effective tax rate of  compared to in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal was primarily due to adjustments made relating to state deferred income taxes 
we continue to expect that our ongoing effective tax rate will be approximately 

table of contents net income of million in fiscal increased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in operating income 
diluted earnings per share of in fiscal increased from in the prior fiscal year 
the difference between diluted earnings per share growth and the increase in net income was primarily due to the reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding  primarily from purchases of our common stock in connection with our stock repurchase programs as described within liquidity and capital resources  net of the impact of stock option exercises 
year ended september  compared with year ended september  operating results revenue of billion in fiscal  which included bulk deliveries to customer warehouses  increased from the prior fiscal year 
the increase in revenue was due to the growth of abdc and the growth of absg 
during fiscal  of revenue was from sales to institutional customers and was sales to retail customers  this compared to a customer mix in fiscal of institutional and retail 
sales to institutional customers increased in the current fiscal year and sales to retail customers increased in the current fiscal year 
abdc s revenue in fiscal increased by from the prior fiscal year due to overall pharmaceutical market growth  revenue from our new customers  primarily new buying group customers with which we started doing business in march and april of and a new alternate site customer which we added in august collectively representing approximately of abdc s revenue growth in fiscal  and the above market growth of a few of our largest customers 
absg s revenue in fiscal of billion increased from the prior fiscal year due to growth of its distribution businesses  primarily relating to the distribution of nephrology and blood products and its third party logistics business 
the majority of absg s revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states  especially oncology 
gross profit of billion in fiscal increased by million or from the prior fiscal year 
this increase was in large part attributable to our revenue growth  the continued strong growth and profitability of our generic programs with generic revenue increasing by in comparison to the prior fiscal year and increased contributions from fee for service agreements with brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers 
in august  a generic oncology drug  oxaliplatin  was introduced launched and absg s gross profit significantly benefited from this generic launch in fiscal the gross profit benefit that we received from this generic launch significantly exceeded the typical benefit we have experienced in the past from generic launches 
approximately one third of the gross profit increase for fiscal was derived from this new generic product launch 
additionally  in fiscal  we recognized a gain of million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers 
this gain was recorded as a reduction to cost of goods sold 
lastly  in fiscal  we completed a reconciliation with one of our generic suppliers relating to rebate incentives owed to us 
our gross profit benefited by approximately million in fiscal as a result of having completed this reconciliation 
as a percentage of revenue  our gross profit margin of in fiscal improved by basis points from the prior fiscal year due to the strong growth and profitability of our generic programs  including new and recent generic launches  and increased contributions from fee for service agreements with brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers 
additionally  the gain on antitrust litigation settlements  as noted above  had the effect of increasing our gross profit margin by basis points in fiscal all of these factors more than offset the above market growth of some of our largest customers  who benefit from our best pricing  and normal competitive pressures on customer margins 
we recorded a lifo charge of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in our lifo charge reflects strong brand name price inflation and a year over year reduction in generic price deflation 

table of contents operating expenses of billion in fiscal increased by million or from the prior fiscal year due to an increase in bad debt expense of million primarily relating to physician customers within absg s oncology business  an increase in incentive compensation  an increase in depreciation and amortization of million  and additional expenses incurred relating to our business transformation project  which includes a new enterprise resource planning erp system 
the above increases were offset  in part  by a million reduction in employee severance  litigation and other costs and a million reduction in asset impairment charges 
asset impairment charges in the current fiscal year included a write off of capitalized software of million included within distribution  selling and administrative expenses and intangible asset impairment charges of million 
asset impairment charges in the prior fiscal year included intangible asset impairment charges of million and the write off of capitalized software of million included within distribution  selling and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of revenue  operating expenses were in fiscal and represented a significant basis point decline in our operating expense ratio from the prior fiscal year  reflecting our strong operating leverage particularly within abdc as its operating expenses remained relatively flat in fiscal in comparison to the prior fiscal year  despite its revenue growth 
our operating leverage has benefited from significant productivity increases achieved from our highly automated distribution facilities and our ce initiative  as described below 
in july and october  we implemented the first and second phases of our new erp system 
as a result  we started to depreciate a significant portion of our capitalized project costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal additionally  we started to incur other significant costs to support our new erp system as we began the transition from our legacy information systems to our erp system 
in fiscal  we announced a more streamlined organizational structure and introduced an initiative ce designed to drive increased customer efficiency and cost effectiveness 
in connection with these efforts  we reduced various operating costs and terminated certain positions 
in fiscal  we terminated employees and incurred million of employee severance costs relating to our ce initiative 
additionally  in fiscal  we recorded million of expense to increase our liability relating to a former executive employee matter 
in fiscal  we reversed our remaining million liability relating to this matter 
operating income of billion in fiscal increased million or from the prior fiscal year due to the increase in our gross profit 
as a percentage of revenue  operating income increased basis points to in fiscal due to the increase in our gross profit margin and the decrease in our operating expense ratio 
the net impact of the gain on antitrust litigation settlements  the benefit from employee severance  litigation and other  and the intangible asset impairments increased operating income as a percentage of revenue by basis points in fiscal the costs of employee severance  litigation and other  and the intangible asset impairments decreased operating income as a percentage of revenue by basis points in fiscal interest expense  interest income  and their respective weighted average interest rates in fiscal and were as follows in thousands weighted average weighted average amount interest rate amount interest rate interest expense interest income interest expense  net interest expense increased from the prior fiscal year due to an increase of million in average borrowings  offset in part  by an increase in interest costs capitalized relating to our business transformation project and a decrease in the weighted average variable interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facilities to from in the prior fiscal year 
interest costs capitalized in fiscal and were million and million  respectively 
interest income decreased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average interest rate  offset in part  by an increase in average invested cash of million 
average borrowings increased in fiscal resulting from the november issuance of million of ten year senior notes  offset in part  by the repayment of substantially all amounts then outstanding under our multi currency revolving credit facility both described in liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents income taxes in fiscal reflect an effective income tax rate of  compared to in the prior fiscal year 
due to the impact of discrete tax events  we were able to recognize certain federal and state tax benefits in fiscal and  thereby reducing our effective tax rate from a normalized 
income from continuing operations of million in fiscal increased from million in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in operating income 
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of in fiscal increased from per share in the prior fiscal year 
the difference between diluted earnings per share growth and the increase in income from continuing operations was primarily due to the reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding  primarily from purchases of our common stock in connection with our stock repurchase program see liquidity and capital resources  net of the impact of stock option exercises 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those policies which involve accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment 
actual results may differ from these estimates due to uncertainties inherent in such estimates 
below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
for a complete list of significant accounting policies  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us for our pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and a reserve for customer sales returns 
in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider a combination of factors  such as the aging of trade receivables  industry trends  and our customers financial strength  credit standing  and payment and default history 
changes in the aforementioned factors  among others  may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables 
each of our business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based on historical experience and for specific credit problems when they arise 
we write off balances against the reserves when collectability is deemed remote 
each business unit performs formal documented reviews of the allowance at least quarterly and our largest business units perform such reviews monthly 
there were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended september    and and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods 
the bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for doubtful accounts  net of write offs  recoveries and other adjustments 
schedule ii of this form k sets forth a rollforward of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended september    and was million  million  and million respectively 
an increase or decrease of in the allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on accounts receivable of approximately million 
supplier reserves we establish reserves against amounts due from our suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives  including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them 
these reserve estimates are established based on the judgment of management after carefully considering the status of current outstanding claims  historical experience with the suppliers  the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available to us 
we evaluate the amounts due from our suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances 
an increase or decrease of in the supplier reserve balances as a percentage of trade payables would result in an increase or decrease in cost of goods sold by approximately million 
the ultimate outcome of any outstanding claim may be different from our estimate 

table of contents loss contingencies an estimated loss contingency is accrued in our consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events 
we regularly review loss contingencies to determine the adequacy of our accruals and related disclosures 
the amount of the actual loss may differ significantly from these estimates 
merchandise inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost for approximately and of our inventories at september  and  respectively  has been determined using the last in  first out lifo method 
if we had used the first in  first out fifo method of inventory valuation  which approximates current replacement cost  inventories would have been approximately million and million higher than the amounts reported at september  and  respectively 
we recorded a lifo charge of million  million  and million in fiscal   and respectively 
business combinations the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values  with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill 
we engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such valuations require management to make significant judgments  estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies  and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships  trade names  existing technology  and other intangible assets  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual events 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess purchase price of an acquired entity over the net amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  rather  they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
intangible assets with finite lives  primarily customer relationships  non compete agreements  patents and software technology  are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
in order to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  a determination of the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite lives is required and is based  among other things  on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit and or the component of the entity being valued 
we are required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and record any resulting impairment losses at least on an annual basis or more often if warranted by events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value may exceed fair value impairment indicators 
this impairment test includes the projection and discounting of cash flows  analysis of our market capitalization and estimating the fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities 
estimating future cash flows and determining their present values are based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and appropriate discount rates determined by management 
we completed our required annual impairment tests relating to goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of fiscal   and  and  as a result  recorded million  million  and million of impairment charges  respectively 
in fiscal  due to the existence of impairment indicators at us bioservices  a specialty pharmacy company within our specialty group  we performed an impairment test on the pharmacy s trade name as of june   which resulted in an impairment charge of million 
our estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to the business model  or changes in operating performance 
significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our future financial results 
share based compensation we utilize a binomial option pricing model to determine the fair value of share based compensation expense  which involves the use of several assumptions  including expected term of the option  future volatility  dividend yield and forfeiture rate 
the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock as well as other factors  such as implied volatility 

table of contents income taxes our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and uncertain tax positions reflect management s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities  as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 
we have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain 
expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually 
after application of the valuation allowances described above  we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other deferred income tax assets described above 
we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 
in the normal course of business  our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities 
inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation  regulation and or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and the amount of benefits recognized in our financial statements for uncertain tax positions are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
however  others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued 
the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year 
if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change  an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by on income before income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the following table illustrates our debt structure at september   including availability under revolving credit facilities and the receivables securitization facility in thousands outstanding additional balance availability fixed rate debt  senior notes due  senior notes due  senior notes due other total fixed rate debt variable rate debt blanco revolving credit facility due multi currency revolving credit facility due receivables securitization facility due other total variable rate debt total debt  including current portion along with our cash balances  our aggregate availability under our revolving credit facilities and our receivables securitization facility provides us sufficient sources of capital to fund our working capital requirements

we have a million multi currency senior unsecured revolving credit facility  which was scheduled to expire in march  the multi currency revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders 
in october  we entered into an amendment with the syndicate of lenders to extend the maturity date of the multi currency revolving credit facility to october the amendment also reduced our borrowing rates and facility fees 
interest on borrowings under the multi currency revolving credit facility accrues at specified rates based on our debt rating and ranges from basis points to basis points over libor euribor bankers acceptance stamping fee  as applicable currently basis points over libor euribor bankers acceptance stamping fee 
additionally  interest on borrowings denominated in canadian dollars may accrue at the greater of the canadian prime rate or the cdor rate

we may choose to repay or reduce our commitments under the multi currency revolving credit facility at any time 
the multi currency revolving credit facility contains covenants  including compliance with a financial leverage ratio test  as well as others that impose limitations on  among other things  indebtedness of excluded subsidiaries and asset sales 
on october   we established a commercial paper program whereby we may from time to time issue short term promissory notes in an aggregate amount of up to million at any one time 
amounts available under the program may be borrowed  repaid  and re borrowed from time to time 
the maturities on the notes will vary  but may not exceed days from the date of issuance 
the notes will bear interest rates  if interest bearing  or will be sold at a discount from their face amounts 
the commercial paper program is fully backed by our multi currency revolving credit facility 
we have a million receivables securitization facility receivables securitization facility  which was scheduled to expire in april in october  we entered into an amendment to the receivables securitization facility to extend the maturity date to october the amendment also reduced our borrowing rates

interest rates are currently based on prevailing market rates for short term commercial paper or libor plus a program fee of basis points 
we currently pay an unused fee of basis points  annually  to maintain the availability under the receivables securitization facility 
at september   there were no borrowings outstanding under the receivables securitization facility 
the receivables securitization facility contains similar covenants to the multi currency revolving credit facility 
in connection with the receivables securitization facility  abdc sells on a revolving basis certain accounts receivable to amerisource receivables financial corporation  a wholly owned special purpose entity  which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the receivables to commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions 
abdc is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the receivables securitization facility 
after the maximum limit of receivables sold has been reached and as sold receivables are collected  additional receivables may be sold up to the maximum amount available under the facility 
we use the facility as a financing vehicle because it generally offers an attractive interest rate relative to other financing sources 
in april  we amended the million blanco revolving credit facility  the blanco credit facility to extend the maturity date to april borrowings under the blanco credit facility are guaranteed by us 
interest on borrowings under this facility accrues at basis points over libor

market risk our most significant market risk historically has been the effect of fluctuations in interest rates relating to our debt 
we manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt 
at september   we had million of variable rate debt outstanding 
the amount of variable rate debt fluctuates during the year based on our working capital requirements 
we periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates 
however  there are no assurances that such instruments will be available in the combinations we want and on terms acceptable to us 
there were no such financial instruments in effect at september  we also have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash equivalents 
we had billion in cash and cash equivalents at september  the unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variable rate debt 
for every million of cash invested that is in excess of variable rate debt  a basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by million 
we are exposed to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our non us operations 
our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the canadian dollar 
we may utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign exchange rates 
such contracts generally have durations of less than one year 
we had no foreign currency denominated forward contracts at september  we may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure but not for speculative or trading purposes
