in connection with the acquisition  we identified an uncertain tax position  and as a result  we recorded million in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at december  the operating results of bdl media are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date 
the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted as of december  based on actual performance and an updated assessment of future performance

north social provides facebook applications that enable businesses to create  manage and promote their business on facebook which will broaden our social media solution 
the fair value of the consideration paid for this acquisition will be allocated to the assets purchased and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date 
sources of revenues we derive our revenues from subscription agreements and related services and from news distribution services 
our subscription agreements contain multiple service elements and deliverables  which generally include use of our cloud based software  hosting services  content and content updates and customer support and may also include implementation and training services 
the typical term of our subscription agreements is one year  however  our customers may purchase subscriptions with multi year terms 
we separately invoice our customers in advance of their annual subscription  with payment terms that require our customers to pay us generally within days of invoice 
our subscription agreements typically are non cancelable  though customers have the right to terminate their agreements for cause if we materially breach our obligations under the agreement 
our subscription agreements may include amounts that are not yet contractually billable to customers  and any such unbilled amounts are not recorded in deferred revenue until invoiced 
additionally  we derive revenue on a per transaction basis from our news distribution services 
we generally receive payment in advance of the online distribution of the news release 
professional services revenue consists primarily of data migration  custom development and training sold separately after the initial subscription agreement 
our professional service engagements are billed on a fixed fee basis with payment terms requiring our customers to pay us within days of invoice 
revenues from professional services sold separately from subscription agreements have not been material to our business 
during the year ended december   professional services sold separately accounted for less than of our revenues 
cost of revenues and operating expenses cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of compensation for training  editorial and support personnel  hosting infrastructure  press release distribution  acquisition  maintenance and amortization of the information database  amortization of purchased technology from business combinations  amortization of capitalized software development costs  depreciation associated with computer equipment and software and allocated overhead 
we allocate overhead expenses such as employee benefits  computer and office supplies  management information systems and depreciation for computer equipment based on headcount 
as a result  indirect overhead expenses are included in cost of revenues and each operating expense category 
we believe content is an integral part of our solution and provides our customers with access to broad  current and relevant information critical to their public relations efforts 
we expect to continue to make investments in both our own content as well as content acquired from third parties and to continue to enhance our proprietary information database and enhance our news monitoring and social media monitoring services 
we expect in  cost of revenues will increase in absolute dollars but will remain flat or decrease slightly as a percentage of revenues 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses are our largest operating expense 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation for our sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions and incentives  marketing programs  including lead generation  promotional events  webinars and other brand building expenses and allocated overhead 
we expense our sales commissions at the time a subscription agreement is executed by the customer  and we recognize substantially all of our revenues ratably over the term of the corresponding subscription agreement 
as a result  we incur sales expense before the recognition of the related revenues 
we plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing to add new customers  increase sales to our existing customers and increase sales of our online news release distribution services 
such investments will include adding sales personnel and expanding our marketing activities to build brand awareness and generate additional sales leads 
we expect in  sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars but will remain flat as a percentage of revenues 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation for our software application development personnel and allocated overhead 
we have historically focused our research and development efforts on increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our cloud based software 
because of our hosted  on demand model  we are able to provide our customers with a single  shared version of our most recent application 
as a result  we do not have to maintain legacy versions of our software  which enables us to have relatively low expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software business models 
we expect that in  research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars but will remain flat or increase slightly as a percentage of revenues 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of compensation and related expenses for executive  finance  legal  human resources and administrative personnel  as well as fees for legal  accounting and other consulting services  including acquisition related transaction costs  third party payment processing and credit card fees  facilities rent  other corporate expenses and allocated overhead 
we expect that in  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars but will remain flat as a percentage of revenues 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortized intangible assets consist of customer relationships  trade names and agreements not to complete acquired in business combinations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment or complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service has been provided to the customer  the collection of the fee is probable and the amount of the fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
our subscription agreements generally contain multiple service elements and deliverables 
these elements include access to our cloud based software  hosting services  content and content updates and customer support and may also include implementation and training services 
our subscription agreements do not provide customers the right to take possession of the software at any time 
all elements in our multiple element subscription agreements are considered a single unit of accounting  and accordingly  we recognize all associated fees over the subscription period  which is typically one year 
we recognize our revenue over the subscription period because the access to our software is the last element delivered to the customer and the predominant element of our agreements 
we determined that we do not have objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the subscription to our cloud based software 
professional services sold separately from a subscription arrangement are recognized as the services are performed 
we distribute press releases over the internet which are indexed by major search engines and distributed directly to various news sites  journalists and other key constituents 
we recognize revenue on a per transaction basis when the press releases are made available to the public 
on january   we will adopt the updated authoritative guidance on multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the new guidance revises the criteria for separating deliverables  measuring and allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting 
this update also establishes a hierarchy for determining the best selling price of a deliverable and significantly enhances disclosure requirements for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
we have evaluated the impact of the adoption of the new guidance and we do not expect the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
sales commissions 
sales commissions are expensed when we invoice a customer under their subscription agreement 
as a result  we incur sales expense before the recognition of the related revenues 
stock based compensation 
we recognize compensation expense for equity awards based on the fair value of the award and on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award based on the estimated portion of the award that is expected to vest 
we apply estimated forfeiture rates based on analyses of historical data  including termination patterns and other factors 
we use the quoted closing market price of our common stock on the grant date to measure the fair value of our restricted stock awards 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of our option awards 
we became a public entity in december  and therefore have a limited history of volatility 
accordingly  the expected volatility is based on the historical volatilities of similar entities common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected term of the awards 
the historical volatilities of these entities have not differed significantly from our historical volatility 
the expected term of an award is equal to the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term of the award 
the risk free interest rate is based on the rate on us treasury securities with maturities consistent with the estimated expected term of the awards 
we have not paid dividends and do not anticipate paying a cash dividend in the foreseeable future and  accordingly  use an expected dividend yield of zero 
business combinations 
we have completed acquisitions of businesses that have resulted in the recording of goodwill and identifiable definite lived intangible assets 
definite lived intangible assets consist of acquired customer relationships  trade names  agreements not to compete and purchased technology 
definite lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from two to seven years 
the company recognizes all of the assets acquired  liabilities assumed and contingent consideration at their fair values on the acquisition date 
acquisition related costs are recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
accounting for these acquisitions requires us to make determinations about the fair value of assets acquired  useful live lives for definite lived tangible and intangible assets  and liabilities assumed that involve estimates and judgments 
goodwill and long lived assets 
goodwill is not amortized  but rather is assessed for impairment at least annually 
goodwill impairment is evaluated using a two step process 
the first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
however  if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss to recognize  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount  then goodwill is not considered impaired 
however  if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we perform our annual impairment assessment on november  or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
we operate under one reporting unit  and as a result  evaluate goodwill impairment based on the fair value of our company as a whole 
we use an income approach based on discounted cash flows to determine the fair value of our reporting unit 
our cash flow assumptions consider historical and forecasted revenue  operating costs and other relevant factors which are consistent with the plans used to manage our operations 
the results of our most recent annual assessment performed on november  did not indicate any impairment of goodwill  and as such  the second step of the impairment test was not required 
we also review the carrying amount of our reporting unit to its fair value based on quoted market prices of our common stock  or market capitalization 
the market capitalization of the company exceeded its carrying amount by a substantial margin 
no events or circumstances occurred from the date of the assessment through december  that would impact this conclusion 
we assess impairment of definite lived intangible and other long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may no longer be fully recoverable 
we determine the impairment  if any  by comparing the carrying value of the assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets 
an impairment charge is recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
impairment charges for long lived assets for the year ended december  were not material 
there were no impairment charges for long lived assets for the years ended december  and income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets are reduced by the valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our estimates related to liabilities for uncertain tax positions require us to make judgments regarding the sustainability of each uncertain tax position based on its technical merits 
if we determine it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits  we record the impact of the position in our consolidated financial statements at the largest amount that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
our estimates are updated at each reporting date based on the facts  circumstances and information available 
we are also required to assess at each reporting date whether it is reasonably possible that any significant increases or decreases to our unrecognized tax benefits will occur during the next twelve months 
in connection with our acquisitions  we identified an uncertain tax position  and as a result  recorded million in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at december  we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdictions and various state and foreign jurisdictions and are subject to us federal  state  and foreign tax examinations for years ranging from to at december  and  we had approximately and million in gross deferred tax assets  respectively 
during  we concluded that it is more likely than not that we will have future income sufficient to realize certain of our deferred tax assets and we reversed our valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets 
as of december  and  we maintained a full valuation against our foreign deferred tax assets

in  we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million  net of landlord contributions  specifically for the remaining construction  build out and furnishing of our corporate headquarters 
as of december   we had a letter of credit outstanding in favor of the landlord of our current corporate headquarters in lanham  maryland 
the letter of credit renewed annually and expires in april as of december   the letter of credit remained outstanding  however  no amounts had been drawn against it 
the letter of credit is collateralized by a  certificate of deposit which is maintained at the granting financial institution and matures in may in may  we also established a letter of credit in favor of the landlord of the new corporate headquarters in beltsville  maryland 
the irrevocable letter of credit is in the amount of  the letter of credit does not require a compensating balance  renews annually and is active through may in accordance with the terms of the lease agreement  we are permitted to reduce the letter of credit by approximately  annually for each of the first five years commencing on the first anniversary of the lease year 
as of december   the letter of credit remained outstanding  however  no amounts had been drawn against it 
as of december   we had us federal net operating loss carry forwards of million which may be available to offset potential payments of future income tax liabilities and which  if unused  will begin to expire in as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
other than our operating leases for office space and computer equipment  we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
we intend to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operations 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and investments together with our expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  that requires us to make future cash payments 
payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases contractual commitments long term debt under note payable interest on long term debt under note payable capital lease obligations total obligations the contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum services to be used  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
obligations under agreements that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the british pound sterling  euro  hong kong dollar and chinese yuan 
as a result  we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of currencies against the us dollar 
revenues denominated in a foreign currency were approximately of our total revenues in the year ended december   of our total revenues in the year ended and of our total revenues in the year ended exchange rate fluctuations have not significantly impacted our results of operations and cash flows 
our future results of operations and cash flows may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
historically  we have not utilized derivative financial instruments to hedge our foreign exchange exposure  however  we may choose to use such contracts in the future 
interest rate sensitivity our cash equivalents and investments consist primarily of money market funds  corporate notes and bonds  government sponsored agency securities and other debt securities 
our interest income is subject to interest rate risk 
for the year ended december  a fluctuation in interest rates of percentage point would change interest income by approximately million 
our variable rate debt consists of a note payable that bears interest at the euribor rate plus 
as of december   outstanding borrowings were approximately  and therefore  fluctuations in interest rates would not have materially affected our interest expense
