the federal reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the community to be served 
consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy  and consideration of convenience and needs issues includes the parties performance under the cra  both of which are discussed below 
in addition  the federal reserve must take into account the institutions effectiveness in combating money laundering 
fdic temporary liquidity guarantee program in october  the fdic announced the temporary liquidity guarantee program the tlgp  under which the fdic would guarantee certain senior unsecured debt of fdic insured us depository institutions and us bank holding companies as well as non interest bearing transaction account deposits at fdic insured us depository institutions  unless such institutions opted out of the program 
regions and regions bank both participated in the tlgp

depositor preference under federal law  depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution in the liquidation or other resolution of such an institution by any receiver 
incentive compensation guidelines adopted by the federal banking agencies pursuant to the fdia prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer  employee  director or principal stockholder 
in june  the federal reserve issued comprehensive guidance on incentive compensation policies the incentive compensation guidance intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk taking 
the incentive compensation guidance  which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization  either individually or as part of a group  is based upon the key principles that a banking organization s incentive compensation arrangements should i provide incentives that do not encourage risk taking beyond the organization s ability to effectively identify and manage risks  ii be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management  and iii be supported by strong corporate governance  including active and effective oversight by the organization s board of directors 
any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization s supervisory ratings  which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions 
the incentive compensation guidance provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation 
table of contents arrangements or related risk management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies 
in february  the federal reserve and other federal banking agencies requested comments on a notice of proposed rulemaking designed to implement provisions of the dodd frank act prohibiting incentive compensation arrangements that would encourage inappropriate risk taking at a covered institution  which includes a bank or bank holding company with billion or more of assets  such as regions and regions bank 
the proposed rule i prohibits incentive based compensation arrangements that encourage executive officers  employees  directors or principal shareholders to expose the institution to inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation based on the standards for excessive compensation adopted pursuant to the fdia and ii prohibits incentive based compensation arrangements for executive officers  employees  directors or principal shareholders that could lead to a material financial loss for the institution 
the proposed rule requires covered institutions to establish policies and procedures for monitoring and evaluating their compensation practices 
institutions with consolidated assets of billion or more  such as regions  are subject to additional restrictions on compensation arrangements for their executive officers and any other persons indentified by the institution s board of directors as having the ability to expose the institution to substantial losses 
in addition  on january   the fdic announced that it would seek public comment on whether banks with compensation plans that encourage risky behavior should be charged higher deposit assessment rates than such banks would otherwise be charged 
the scope and content of the us banking regulators policies on incentive compensation are continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving in the near future 
it cannot be determined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect the ability of regions and its subsidiaries to hire  retain and motivate their key employees 
orderly liquidation authority the dodd frank act creates the orderly liquidation authority ola  a resolution regime for systemically important non bank financial companies  including bank holding companies  under which the fdic may be appointed receiver to liquidate such a company if the company is in danger of default and presents a systemic risk to us financial stability 
this determination must come after supermajority recommendations by the federal reserve and the fdic and consultation between the secretary of the us treasury and the president 
this resolution authority is similar to the fdic resolution model for depository institutions  with certain modifications to reflect differences between depository institutions and non bank financial companies and to reduce disparities between the treatment of creditors claims under the us bankruptcy code and in an orderly liquidation authority proceeding compared to those that would exist under the resolution model for insured depository institutions 
an orderly liquidation fund will fund ola liquidation proceedings through borrowings from the treasury department and risk based assessments made  first  on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in liquidation to the extent of such excess  and second  if necessary  on bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of billion or more  such as regions 
if an orderly liquidation is triggered  regions could face assessments for the orderly liquidation fund 
we do not yet have an indication of the level of such assessments 
financial privacy the federal banking regulators have adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non public information about consumers to non affiliated third parties 
these limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and  in some circumstances  allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a non affiliated third party 
these regulations affect how consumer 
table of contents information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors 
in addition  consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service  such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications 
consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services 
community reinvestment act regions bank is subject to the provisions of the cra 
under the terms of the cra  regions bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its communities  including providing credit to individuals residing in low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community  consistent with the cra 
the cra requires each appropriate federal bank regulatory agency  in connection with its examination of a depository institution  to assess such institution s record in assessing and meeting the credit needs of the community served by that institution  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the regulatory agency s assessment of the institution s record is made available to the public 
the assessment also is part of the federal reserve s consideration of applications to acquire  merge or consolidate with another banking institution or its holding company  to establish a new branch office that will accept deposits or to relocate an office 
in the case of a bank holding company applying for approval to acquire a bank or other bank holding company  the federal reserve will assess the records of each subsidiary depository institution of the applicant bank holding company  and such records may be the basis for denying the application 
regions bank received a satisfactory cra rating in its most recent examination 
usa patriot act a focus of governmental policy relating to financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing 
the usa patriot act of the usa patriot act broadened the application of anti money laundering regulations to apply to additional types of financial institutions such as broker dealers  investment advisors and insurance companies  and strengthened the ability of the us government to help prevent  detect and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism 
the principal provisions of title iii of the usa patriot act require that regulated financial institutions  including state member banks i establish an anti money laundering program that includes training and audit components  ii comply with regulations regarding the verification of the identity of any person seeking to open an account  iii take additional required precautions with non us owned accounts  and iv perform certain verification and certification of money laundering risk for their foreign correspondent banking relationships 
failure of a financial institution to comply with the usa patriot act s requirements could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution 
regions banking  broker dealer and insurance subsidiaries have augmented their systems and procedures to meet the requirements of these regulations and will continue to revise and update their policies  procedures and controls to reflect changes required by the usa patriot act and implementing regulations 
office of foreign assets control regulation the united states has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries  nationals and others 
these are typically known as the ofac rules based on their administration by the us treasury department office of foreign assets control ofac 
the ofac administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms 
generally  however  they contain one or more of the following elements i restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country  including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on us persons engaging in financial transactions relating to  making investments in  or providing investment related advice or assistance to  
table of contents a sanctioned country  and ii a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest  by prohibiting transfers of property subject to us jurisdiction including property in the possession or control of us persons 
blocked assets eg  property and bank deposits cannot be paid out  withdrawn  set off or transferred in any manner without a license from ofac 
failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences 
regulation of insurers and insurance brokers regions operations in the areas of insurance brokerage and reinsurance of credit life insurance are subject to regulation and supervision by various state insurance regulatory authorities 
although the scope of regulation and form of supervision may vary from state to state  insurance laws generally grant broad discretion to regulatory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities 
this supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling of customer funds held in a fiduciary capacity 
certain of regions insurance company subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulatory supervision and to insurance laws and regulations requiring  among other things  maintenance of capital  record keeping  reporting and examinations 
regulation of morgan keegan morgan keegan is subject to regulation and examination by the sec  finra  nyse and other sros 
such regulations cover a broad range of subject matter 
rules and regulations for registered broker dealers cover such issues as capital requirements  sales and trading practices  use of client funds and securities  the conduct of directors  officers and employees  record keeping and recording  supervisory procedures to prevent improper trading on material non public information  qualification and licensing of sales personnel  and limitations on the extension of credit in securities transactions 
rules and regulations for registered investment advisers include limitations on the ability of investment advisers to charge performance based or non refundable fees to clients  record keeping and reporting requirements  disclosure requirements  limitations on principal transactions between an adviser or its affiliates and advisory clients  and anti fraud standards 
morgan keegan is subject to the net capital requirements set forth in rule c of the securities exchange act of the net capital requirements measure the general financial condition and liquidity of a broker dealer by specifying a minimum level of net capital that a broker dealer must maintain  and by requiring that a significant portion of its assets be kept liquid 
if morgan keegan failed to maintain its minimum required net capital  it would be required to cease executing customer transactions until it came back into compliance 
this could also result in morgan keegan losing its finra membership  its registration with the sec or require a complete liquidation 
the sec s risk assessment rules also apply to morgan keegan as a registered broker dealer 
these rules require broker dealers to maintain and preserve records and certain information  describe risk management policies and procedures  and report on the financial condition of affiliates whose financial and securities activities are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial and operational condition of the broker dealer 
certain material associated persons of morgan keegan  as defined in the risk assessment rules  may also be subject to sec regulation 
in addition to federal registration  state securities commissions require the registration of certain broker dealers and investment advisers 
morgan keegan is registered as a broker dealer with every state  the district of columbia  and puerto rico 
morgan keegan is registered as an investment adviser in over states and the district of columbia 
violations of federal  state and sro rules or regulations may result in the revocation of broker dealer or investment adviser licenses  imposition of censures or fines  the issuance of cease and desist orders  and the suspension or expulsion of officers and employees from the securities business firm 

table of contents the dodd frank act contains several provisions which may affect morgan keegan s business  including registration of municipal advisors  increased regulation of investment advisors and conducting a study regarding the fiduciary duties of investment advisors 
morgan keegan s business may be adversely affected by new rules and regulations issued by the sec or sros  the implementation of provisions of the dodd frank act applicable to morgan keegan  and any changes in the enforcement of existing laws and rules that affect its securities business 
competition all aspects of regions business are highly competitive 
regions subsidiaries compete with other financial institutions located in the states in which they operate and other adjoining states  as well as large banks in major financial centers and other financial intermediaries  such as savings and loan associations  credit unions  consumer finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  investment companies  mutual funds  mortgage companies and financial service operations of major commercial and retail corporations 
regions expects competition to intensify among financial services companies due to the recent consolidation of certain competing financial institutions and the conversion of certain investment banks to bank holding companies 
customers for banking services and other financial services offered by regions subsidiaries are generally influenced by convenience  quality of service  personal contacts  price of services and availability of products 
although regions position varies in different markets  regions believes that its affiliates effectively compete with other financial services companies in their relevant market areas 
employees as of december   regions and its subsidiaries had  employees

item a 
risk factors our businesses have been and may continue to be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally 
the capital and credit markets since have experienced unprecedented levels of volatility and disruption 
in some cases  the markets produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength 
although the economic slowdown that the united states experienced has begun to reverse and the markets have generally improved  business activities across a wide range of industries continue to face serious difficulties due to the lack of consumer spending and the lack of liquidity in the global credit markets 
heightened unemployment levels have further increased these difficulties 
a sustained weakness or weakening in business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we do business could have one or more of the following adverse effects on our business a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us  
table of contents a decrease in the value of our loans held for sale or other assets secured by consumer or commercial real estate  an impairment of certain intangible assets  such as goodwill  a decrease in interest income from variable rate loans  due to potential reductions in interest rates  and an increase in the number of clients and counterparties who become delinquent  file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to us 
an increase in the number of delinquencies  bankruptcies or defaults could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets  net charge offs  provision for loan losses  and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale 
overall  during the past three years  the general business environment has had an adverse effect on our business 
although the general business environment has shown some improvement  there can be no assurance that it will continue to improve 
if economic conditions worsen or remain volatile  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
market developments may adversely affect our industry  business and results of operations 
dramatic declines in the housing market during recent years  with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures  unemployment and under employment  have negatively impacted the credit performance of real estate related loans and resulted in  and may continue to result in  significant write downs of asset values by us and other financial institutions  including government sponsored entities and major commercial and investment banks 
these write downs  initially of mortgage backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other securities and loans  have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital  to reduce or eliminate dividends  to merge with larger and stronger institutions and  in some cases  to fail 
reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced  and in some cases  ceased to provide funding to borrowers including financial institutions 
further negative market developments may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns  causing increases in delinquencies and default rates  which may impact our charge offs and provisions for credit losses 
continuing economic deterioration that affects household or corporate incomes could also result in reduced demand for credit or fee based products and services 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial services industry 
our status as a non investment grade issuer and any future reductions in our credit ratings may increase our funding costs or place limitations on business activities related to providing credit support to customers 
the major rating agencies regularly evaluate us and their ratings of our long term debt based on a number of factors  including our financial strength and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally 
over the past two years  all of the major ratings agencies downgraded regions and regions bank s credit ratings  and many of our ratings remain on negative watch or negative outlook 
negative watch  negative outlook or other similar terms mean that a future downgrade is possible 
most recently  regions senior ratings were downgraded to ba  bb  bbb and bbb by moody s investor services  standard poor s  fitch ratings and dominion bond rating service  respectively 
our ratings with moody s investor services and standard poor s are below investment grade 
in general  ratings agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors  including capital adequacy  liquidity  asset quality  business mix and level and quality of earnings  and we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings 
the ratings assigned to regions and regions bank remain subject to change at any time  and it is possible that any ratings agency will take action to downgrade regions  regions bank or both in the future 

table of contents the decreases in our credit rating over the past two years  our status as a non investment grade issuer and any future decrease in our credit ratings by one or more ratings agencies could impact our access to the capital markets or short term funding or increase our financing costs  and thereby adversely affect regions financial condition and liquidity 
where regions bank is providing forms of credit support such as letters of credit  standby lending arrangements or other forms of credit support  this recent decline and future declines may cause customers of regions to seek replacement credit support from a higher rated institution and may limit our ability to compete for future business 
our counterparties are also sensitive to the risk of a ratings downgrade and have the ability to terminate or may be less likely to engage in transactions with us  or may only engage in transactions with us at a substantially higher cost 
we cannot predict whether customer relationships or opportunities for future relationships could be adversely affected by customers who choose to do business with a higher rated institution 
the inability to retain customers or to effectively compete for new business may have a material and adverse effect on regions business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  ratings agencies have themselves been subject to scrutiny arising from the financial crisis such that the rating agencies may make or may be required to make substantial changes to their ratings policies and practices 
such changes may  among other things  adversely affect the ratings of our securities or other securities in which we have an economic interest 
the value of our deferred tax assets could adversely affect our operating results and regulatory capital ratios 
as of december   regions had approximately billion in net deferred tax assets  of which million was disallowed when calculating regulatory capital 
applicable banking regulations permit us to include these deferred tax assets  up to a maximum amount  when calculating regions regulatory capital to the extent these assets will be realized based on future projected earnings within one year of the report date 
the ability to realize these deferred tax assets during any year also includes the ability to apply these assets to offset any taxable income during the two previous years 
unless we anticipate generating sufficient taxable income in the future  we may be unable to include additional amounts related to our deferred tax assets as part of our regulatory capital 
the inability to include deferred tax assets in our regulatory capital could significantly reduce our regulatory capital ratios 
additionally  our deferred tax assets are subject to an evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that they will be realized for financial statement purposes 
in making this determination we consider all positive and negative evidence available including the impact of recent operating results as well as potential carryback of tax to prior years taxable income  reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  tax planning strategies and projected earnings within the statutory tax loss carryover period 
we have determined that the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized at december  except for million related to state deferred tax assets for which we have established a valuation allowance 
if we were to conclude that a significant portion of our deferred tax assets were not more likely than not to be realized  the required valuation allowance could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
we have been the subject of increased litigation which could result in legal liability and damage to our reputation 
we and certain of our subsidiaries have been named from time to time as defendants in various class actions and other litigation relating to their business and activities 
past  present and future litigation have included or could include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages 
we and certain of our subsidiaries are also involved from time to time in other reviews  investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and self regulatory agencies regarding their business 
these matters also could result in adverse judgments  settlements  fines  penalties  injunctions or other relief 
in addition  in recent years  a number of judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories  collectively termed lender liability 
generally  
table of contents lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty  whether implied or contractual  of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or shareholders 
substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us or our subsidiaries could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations or cause significant harm to our reputation 
additional information relating to litigation affecting regions and our subsidiaries is discussed in note commitments  contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
further disruptions in the residential real estate market could adversely affect our performance 
as of december   investor real estate loans secured by land  single family and condominium properties  plus home equity loans secured by second liens in florida represented approximately percent of our total loan portfolio 
these portions of our loan portfolio have been under pressure for over three years and  due to weakening credit quality  we have increased our loan loss provision and our total allowance for credit losses 
in addition  we have implemented several measures to support the management of these sections of the loan portfolio  including reassignment of experienced  key relationship managers to focus on work out strategies for distressed borrowers 
while we expect that these actions will help mitigate the overall effects of the downward credit cycle  the weaknesses in these sections of our loan portfolio are expected to continue well into accordingly  it is anticipated that our non performing asset and charge off levels will remain elevated 
further  the effects of recent mortgage market challenges  combined with decreases in residential real estate market prices and demand  could result in further price reductions in home values  adversely affecting the value of collateral securing the residential real estate and construction loans that we hold  as well as loan originations and gains on sale of real estate and construction loans 
specifically  a significant portion of our residential mortgages and commercial real estate loan portfolios are composed of borrowers in the southeastern united states  in which certain markets have been particularly adversely affected by declines in real estate value  declines in home sale volumes  and declines in new home building 
for example  prices of florida properties remain under significant pressure  with high unemployment levels relative to periods prior to and the continuing impact of the recent real estate downturn on the general economy 
these factors could result in higher delinquencies and greater charge offs in future periods  which would materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
a decline in home values or overall economic weakness could also have an adverse impact upon the value of real estate or other assets which we own upon foreclosing on a loan 
continuing weakness in the commercial real estate market could adversely affect our performance 
the fundamentals within the commercial real estate sector remain weak  under continuing pressure from reduced asset values  rising vacancies and reduced rents 
as of december   approximately percent of our loan portfolio consisted of investor real estate loans 
investor real estate loans secured by land  single family and condominiums continue to be impacted by declining property values  especially in areas where regions has significant lending activities  including florida and north georgia 
the properties securing income producing investor real estate loans are typically not fully leased at the origination of the loan 
the borrower s ability to repay the loan is instead reliant upon additional leasing through the life of the loan or the borrower s successful operation of a business 
weak economic conditions may impair a borrower s business operations and typically slow the execution of new leases 
such economic conditions may also lead to existing lease turnover 
as a result of these factors  vacancy rates for retail  office and industrial space may remain at elevated levels in high vacancy rates could result in rents falling further over the next several quarters 
the combination of these factors could result in further deterioration in the fundamentals underlying the commercial real estate market and the deterioration of one or more loans we have made 
any such deterioration could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our profitability and liquidity may be affected by changes in economic conditions in the areas where our operations or loans are concentrated 
our success depends to a certain extent on the general economic conditions of the geographic markets served by regions bank in the states of alabama  arkansas  florida  georgia  illinois  indiana  iowa  kentucky  louisiana  mississippi  missouri  north carolina  south carolina  tennessee  texas and virginia 
the local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on regions bank s commercial  real estate and construction loans  the ability of borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans 
adverse changes in the economic conditions of these geographical areas for over three years have had a negative impact on the financial results of our banking operations and may continue to have a negative effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any future adverse changes may also negatively effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
improvements in economic indicators disproportionately affecting the financial services industry may lag improvements in the general economy 
the improvement of certain economic indicators  such as unemployment and real estate asset values and rents  may continue to lag behind improvement in the overall economy 
these economic indicators typically affect certain industries  such as real estate and financial services  more significantly 
for example  improvements in commercial real estate fundamentals typically lag broad economic recovery by twelve to eighteen months 
our clients include entities active in these industries 
furthermore  financial services companies with a substantial lending business  like ours  are dependent upon the ability of their borrowers to make debt service payments on loans 
should unemployment or real estate asset values fail to recover for an extended period of time  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
negative perceptions associated with our continued participation in the us treasury s capital purchase program may adversely affect our ability to retain customers  attract investors and compete for new business opportunities 
on november   we issued and sold  shares of series a preferred stock and the warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock to the us treasury as part of the cpp 
several financial institutions which also participated in the cpp including some banks considered to be our peer banks have exited  or have applied for permission to exit  the program 
in order to repurchase one or both securities  in whole or in part  we must establish that we have satisfied all of the conditions to repurchase and must obtain the approval of the us treasury 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to repurchase these securities from the us treasury 
our customers  employees and counterparties in our current and future business relationships may draw negative implications regarding the strength of regions as a financial institution based on our continued participation in the cpp following the exit of one or more of our competitors or other financial institutions 
any such negative perceptions may impair our ability to effectively compete with other financial institutions for business or to retain high performing employees 
if this were to occur  our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations may be adversely affected  perhaps materially 
the limitations on incentive compensation contained in the arra and its implementing regulations may adversely affect our ability to retain our highest performing employees 
because we have not yet repurchased the us treasury s cpp investment  we remain subject to the restrictions on incentive compensation contained in the arra 
on june   the us treasury released its interim final rule implementing the provisions of the arra and limiting the compensation practices at institutions in which the us treasury is invested 
financial institutions which have repurchased the us treasury s cpp investment are relieved of the restrictions imposed by the arra and its implementing regulations 
due to these restrictions  we may not be able to successfully compete with financial institutions that have exited the cpp to retain and attract high performing employees 
if this were to occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected  perhaps materially 

table of contents our participation in the us treasury s cpp imposes restrictions and obligations on us that limit our ability to increase dividends  repurchase shares of our common stock and access the equity capital markets 
prior to november   unless we have redeemed all of the series a preferred stock purchased by the us treasury as part of the cpp or the us treasury has transferred all of the series a preferred stock to a third party  the agreement pursuant to which such securities were sold  among other things  limits the payment of dividends on our common stock to a quarterly dividend of per share without prior regulatory approval  limits our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock with certain exceptions  including the repurchase of our common stock to offset share dilution from equity based compensation awards  and grants the holders of such securities certain registration rights which  in certain circumstances  impose lock up periods during which we would be unable to issue equity securities 
regions has reduced its quarterly dividend to per share and does not expect to increase its quarterly dividend above such level for the foreseeable future 
in addition  unless we are able to redeem the preferred stock prior to november   the dividends on the preferred stock will increase substantially  from percent million annually to percent million annually 
we are subject to extensive governmental regulation  which could have an adverse impact on our operations 
the banking industry is extensively regulated and supervised under both federal and state law 
regions and regions bank are subject to the regulation and supervision of the federal reserve  the fdic and the superintendent of banking of the state of alabama 
these regulations are intended primarily to protect depositors  the public and the fdic insurance fund  and not our shareholders 
these regulations govern matters ranging from the regulation of certain debt obligations  changes in the control of bank holding companies and state chartered banks  and the maintenance of adequate capital to the general business operations and financial condition of regions bank  including permissible types  amounts and terms of loans and investments  to the amount of reserves against deposits  restrictions on dividends  establishment of branch offices  and the maximum interest rate that may be charged by law 
additionally  certain subsidiaries of regions  such as morgan keegan  are subject to regulation  supervision and examination by other regulatory authorities  such as the sec  finra and state securities and insurance regulators  and our non bank subsidiaries are subject to oversight by the federal reserve 
as a result  we are subject to changes in federal and state law  as well as regulations and governmental policies  income tax laws and accounting principles 
regulations affecting banks and other financial institutions are undergoing continuous review and frequently change  and the ultimate effect of such changes cannot be predicted 
regulations and laws may be modified at any time  and new legislation may be enacted that will affect us  regions bank and our subsidiaries 
any changes in any federal and state law  as well as regulations and governmental policies  income tax laws and accounting principles  could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways  including ways which may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
failure to appropriately comply with any such laws  regulations or principles could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies  civil money penalties or damage to our reputation  all of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our regulatory position is discussed in greater detail under the capital ratios section of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation of this annual report on form k 
recent legislation regarding the financial services industry may have a significant adverse effect on our operations 
the dodd frank act  which was signed into law on july   implements a variety of far reaching changes and has been called the most sweeping reform of the financial services industry since the s 
many of the provisions of the dodd frank act will directly affect our ability to conduct our business including imposition of higher prudential standards  including more stringent risk based capital  leverage  liquidity and risk management requirements  and numerous other requirements on systemically significant institutions  currently defined to include  among other things  all bank holding companies with assets of at least billion which would include regions  
table of contents establishment of the fsoc to identify and impose additional regulatory oversight of large financial firms  mandates requiring the federal reserve to establish standards for determining whether interchange fees charged by certain financial institutions are reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by such institutions  imposition of additional costs and fees  including fees to be set by the federal reserve and charged to systemically significant institutions to cover the cost of regulating such institutions and any fdic assessment made to cover the costs of any regular or special examination of regions or its affiliates  establishment of the cfpb with broad authority to implement new consumer protection regulations and to examine and enforce compliance with federal consumer laws  application to bank holding companies of regulatory capital requirements similar to those applied to banks  which requirements exclude  on a phase out basis  all trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred stock from tier capital except for preferred stock issued under the us treasury s troubled asset relief program tarp  such as the series a preferred stock  which will continue to qualify as tier capital as long as it remains outstanding  and establishment of new rules and restrictions regarding the origination of mortgages 
many provisions in the dodd frank act remain subject to regulatory rule making and implementation  the effects of which are not yet known 
as a result  it is difficult to gauge the ultimate impact of certain provisions of the dodd frank act because the implementation of many concepts is left to regulatory agencies 
for example  the cfpb is given the power to adopt new regulations to protect consumers and is given control over existing consumer protection regulations adopted by federal banking regulators 
the provisions of the dodd frank act and any rules adopted to implement those provisions as well as any additional legislative or regulatory changes may impact the profitability of our business activities and costs of operations  require that we change certain of our business practices  materially affect our business model or affect retention of key personnel  require us to raise additional regulatory capital  including additional tier capital  and could expose us to additional costs including increased compliance costs 
these and other changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes and may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business as previously conducted or our results of operations or financial condition 
we may need to raise additional debt or equity capital in the future  such capital may be dilutive to our existing shareholders or may not be available when needed or at all 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on  among other things  conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside of our control  and our financial performance 
the recent economic slowdown and loss of confidence in financial institutions may increase our cost of funding and limit our access to some of our customary sources of capital  including  but not limited to  inter bank borrowings  repurchase agreements and borrowings from the discount window of the federal reserve 
additionally  our debt ratings are currently not investment grade according to some credit ratings agencies 
as a non investment grade issuer  our cost of funding and access to the capital markets may be further limited 
we cannot assure you that capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets  such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers  depositors of regions bank or counterparties participating in the capital markets  our status as a non investment grade issuer  or a further downgrade of our debt rating  may adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and  in turn  our liquidity 
an inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents increases in fdic insurance premiums may adversely affect our earnings 
our deposits are insured by the fdic up to legal limits and  accordingly  we are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments 
we generally cannot control the amount of premiums we will be required to pay for fdic insurance 
high levels of bank failures over the past three years and increases in the statutory deposit insurance limits have increased resolution costs to the fdic and put pressure on the dif 
in order to maintain a strong funding position and restore the reserve ratios of the dif  the fdic increased assessment rates on insured institutions  charged a special assessment to all insured institutions as of june  and required banks to prepay three years worth of premiums on december  if there are additional financial institution failures  we may be required to pay even higher fdic premiums than the recently increased levels  or the fdic may charge additional special assessments 
further  the fdic recently increased the dif s target reserve ratio to percent of insured deposits following the dodd frank act s elimination of the percent cap on the dif s reserve ratio 
additional increases in our assessment rate may be required in the future to achieve this targeted reserve ratio 
these recent increases in deposit assessments and any future increases  required prepayments or special assessments of fdic insurance premiums may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
additionally  pursuant to the dodd frank act  the fdic must amend its regulations regarding assessment for federal deposit insurance to base such assessments on the average total consolidated assets of the insured institution during the assessment period  less the average tangible equity of the institution during the assessment period 
currently  we are assessed only on deposit balances  and this change may result in a substantial increase in the base to which the assessment rate is applied 
the fdic adopted a rule implementing this change  as well as adopting a revised risk based assessment calculation in february the fdic has also proposed a rule tying assessment rates of fdic insured institutions to the institution s employee compensation programs 
the exact nature and cumulative effect of these recent changes are not yet known  but they are expected to increase the amount of premiums we must pay for fdic insurance 
any such increase may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the recent repeal of federal prohibitions on payment of interest on demand deposits could increase our interest expense 
all federal prohibitions on the ability of financial institutions to pay interest on demand deposit accounts were repealed as part of the dodd frank act 
as a result  beginning on july   financial institutions could commence offering interest on demand deposits to compete for clients 
we do not yet know what interest rates or products other institutions may offer 
our interest expense will increase and our net interest margin will decrease if we begin offering interest on demand deposits to attract additional customers or maintain current customers 
consequently  our business  financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected  perhaps materially 
we may be subject to more stringent capital requirements 
regions and regions bank are each subject to capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital which each of regions and regions bank must maintain 
from time to time  the regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy guidelines 
if we fail to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements  our financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
in light of proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements contained in the dodd frank act and the regulatory accords on international banking institutions formulated by the basel committee and implemented by the federal reserve  we likely will be required to satisfy additional  more stringent  capital adequacy standards 
the ultimate impact of the new capital and liquidity standards on us cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including the treatment and implementation by the us banking regulators 
these requirements  however  and any other new regulations  could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends  or could require us to reduce business levels or to raise capital  including in ways that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations

if an orderly liquidation of a systemically important non bank financial company were triggered  we could face assessments for the orderly liquidation fund 
the dodd frank act creates a new mechanism  the ola  for liquidation of systemically important nonbank financial companies  including bank holding companies 
the ola is administered by the fdic and is based on the fdic s bank resolution model 
the secretary of the us treasury may trigger a liquidation under this authority only after consultation with the president of the united states and after receiving a recommendation from the boards of the fdic and the federal reserve upon a two thirds vote 
liquidation proceedings will be funded by the orderly liquidation fund  which will borrow from the us treasury and impose risk based assessments on covered financial companies 
risk based assessments would be made  first  on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in the liquidation to the extent of such excess  and second  if necessary  on  among others  bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of billion or more  such as regions 
any such assessments may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
proposed rules regulating the imposition of debit card income may adversely affect our operations 
the dodd frank act gives the federal reserve the authority to establish rules regarding interchange fees charged by payment card issuers for transactions in which a person uses certain types of debit cards  requiring that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to such transaction  subject to a possible adjustment to account for costs incurred in connection with the issuer s fraud prevention policies 
on december   the federal reserve requested comment on a proposed rule which would take effect on july  and which  if enacted  would significantly impact the amount of interchange fees collected by regions bank 
the proposed rule contains two alternative restrictions on the permissible level of interchange fees a uniform restriction of cents per transaction and an issuer specific restriction containing a safe harbor of cents per transaction and a cap of cents per transaction 
neither alternative makes a distinction between pin or signature transactions  and under both alternatives  the interchange fee will be much lower than the cents per transaction which is the average amount charged for all debit transactions according to the federal reserve s study on interchange transactions 
the restrictions on interchange fees contained in the proposed rule would be applicable to all debit card issuers who  together with their affiliates  possess more than billion in assets  such as regions bank  and do not include adjustments associated with costs resulting from compliance with the issuer s fraud prevention policies  which are expected to be included at a later date 
the proposed rule would also prohibit issuers and payment card networks from restricting the number of payment card networks on which an electronic debit transaction may be processed to one network  or two or more networks that are owned  controlled or operated by affiliates or networks affiliated with the issuer 
to implement the network exclusivity restrictions of the proposed rule  the federal reserve has offered two alternative methods for comment 
one alternative alternative a prohibits networks and issuers from limiting the number of payment card networks available for processing an electronic debit transaction to fewer than two unaffiliated networks  regardless of the means by which a transaction may be authorized 
the other alternative alternative b prohibits networks and issuers from limiting the number of networks available for processing an electronic debit transaction to fewer than two unaffiliated networks for each method by which a transaction may be authorized 
in the event the federal reserve adopts alternative b  considerable costs and immense operational complexity will be associated with its implementation 
in  regions bank collected million in debit card income  and without mitigating actions this amount could potentially be negatively impacted going forward 
based on the current proposed rule  regions bank s revenues resulting from debit card income would likely be reduced to approximately one quarter of 
table of contents current levels  absent any mitigating actions  based on the cent alternative described above 
while the final regulations are not yet known  they may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for dividends  distributions and other payments 
we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our banking and other subsidiaries 
our principal source of cash flow  including cash flow to pay dividends to our stockholders and principal and interest on our outstanding debt  is dividends from regions bank 
there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by regions bank to us  as well as by us to our stockholders 
regulations of both the federal reserve and the state of alabama affect the ability of regions bank to pay dividends and other distributions to us and to make loans to us 
due to losses recorded at regions bank during and  under the federal reserve s rules  regions bank may not be able to pay dividends to us in the near term without first obtaining regulatory approval 
if regions bank is unable to make dividend payments to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available  we may not be able to make dividend payments to our common and preferred stockholders or principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt 
see the stockholders equity section of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation of this annual report on form k 
in addition  our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors 
if we experience greater credit losses than anticipated  our earnings may be adversely affected 
as a lender  we are exposed to the risk that our customers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans may not be sufficient to assure repayment 
credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
our credit risk with respect to our real estate and construction loan portfolio will relate principally to the creditworthiness of corporate borrowers and the value of the real estate serving as security for the repayment of loans 
our credit risk with respect to our commercial and consumer loan portfolio will relate principally to the general creditworthiness of businesses and individuals within our local markets 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio and provide an allowance for estimated credit losses based on a number of factors 
we believe that our allowance for credit losses is adequate 
however  if our assumptions or judgments are wrong  our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover our actual credit losses 
we may have to increase our allowance in the future in response to the request of one of our primary banking regulators  to adjust for changing conditions and assumptions  or as a result of any deterioration in the quality of our loan portfolio 
the actual amount of future provisions for credit losses cannot be determined at this time and may vary from the amounts of past provisions 
the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets may decline in the future 
as of december   we had billion of goodwill and million of other intangible assets 
a significant decline in our expected future cash flows  a significant adverse change in the business climate  slower growth rates or a significant and sustained decline in the price of our common stock  any or all of which could be materially impacted by many of the risk factors discussed herein  may necessitate our taking charges in the future related to the impairment of our goodwill 
future regulatory actions could also have a material impact on assessments of goodwill for impairment 
additionally  if the fair values of our net assets improves at a faster rate than the market value of our banking treasury reporting unit  we may also have to take charges related to the impairment of our goodwill 
if we were to conclude that a future write down of our goodwill and other intangible assets is necessary  we would record the appropriate charge  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents rapid and significant changes in market interest rates may adversely affect our performance 
most of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature and subject us to significant risks from changes in interest rates 
our profitability depends to a large extent on our net interest income  and changes in interest rates can impact our net interest income as well as the valuation of our assets and liabilities 
our current one year interest rate sensitivity position is asset sensitive  meaning that an immediate or gradual increase in interest rates would likely have a positive cumulative impact on regions twelve month net interest income 
alternatively  an immediate or gradual decrease in rates over a twelve month period would likely have a negative impact on twelve month net interest income 
however  like most financial institutions  our results of operations are affected by changes in interest rates and our ability to manage interest rate risks 
changes in market interest rates  or changes in the relationships between short term and long term market interest rates  or changes in the relationships between different interest rate indices  can affect the interest rates charged on interest earning assets differently than the interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
this difference could result in an increase in interest expense relative to interest income  or a decrease in our interest rate spread 
for a more detailed discussion of these risks and our management strategies for these risks  see the net interest income and margin and market risk interest rate risk sections of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation of this annual report on form k 
our net interest margin depends on many factors that are partly or completely out of our control  including competition  federal economic monetary and fiscal policies  and general economic conditions 
despite our strategies to manage interest rate risks  changes in interest rates can still have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  regions portfolio segments  particularly investor real estate  include products where terms are tied to benchmark interest rates  such as libor 
an increasing interest rate environment would increase debt service requirements for borrowers with these types of products 
such increases may impact the borrowers ability to pay as contractually obligated 
the performance of our investment portfolio is subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates and market conditions 
changes in interest rates can negatively affect the performance of most of our investments 
interest rate volatility can reduce unrealized gains or create unrealized losses in our portfolios 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions  and other factors beyond our control 
fluctuations in interest rates affect our returns on  and the market value of  our investment securities 
the fair market value of the securities in our portfolio and the investment income from these securities also fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions 
in addition  actual net investment income and cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk  such as mortgage backed and other asset backed securities  may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations 
see the securities section of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation of this annual report on form k 
hurricanes and other weather related events  as well as man made disasters  could cause a disruption in our operations or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
a significant portion of our operations are located in the areas bordering the gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean  regions that are susceptible to hurricanes 
such weather events can cause disruption to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our overall results of operations 
we maintain hurricane insurance  including coverage for lost profits and extra expense  however  there is no insurance against the disruption to the markets that we serve that a catastrophic hurricane could produce 
further  a hurricane in any of our market areas could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to timely repay their loans and may adversely 
table of contents impact the value of any collateral held by us 
man made disasters and other events connected with the gulf of mexico or atlantic ocean  such as the recent gulf oil spill  could have similar effects 
some of the states in which we operate have in recent years experienced extreme droughts 
the severity and impact of future hurricanes  droughts and other weather related events are difficult to predict and may be exacerbated by global climate change 
the effects of past or future hurricanes  droughts and other weather related events could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
industry competition may have an adverse effect on our success 
our profitability depends on our ability to compete successfully 
we operate in a highly competitive environment 
certain of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do 
in our market areas  we face competition from other commercial banks  savings and loan associations  credit unions  internet banks  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  brokerage and investment banking firms  and other financial intermediaries that offer similar services 
some of our non bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern regions or regions bank and may have greater flexibility in competing for business 
regions expects competition to intensify among financial services companies due to the recent consolidation of certain competing financial institutions and the conversion of certain investment banks to bank holding companies 
additionally  the dodd frank act eliminated certain restrictions on the ability of banking institutions to open branches across state lines  a change which may also cause competition among financial services companies to intensify 
should competition in the financial services industry intensify  regions ability to market its products and services and to retain or compete for new business may be adversely affected 
consequently  our business  financial condition or results of operations may also be adversely affected 
maintaining or increasing market share may depend on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services 
our success depends  in part  on the ability to adapt products and services to evolving industry standards 
there is increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower prices 
this can reduce net interest income and noninterest income from fee based products and services 
in addition  the widespread adoption of new technologies could require us to make substantial capital expenditures to modify or adapt existing products and services or develop new products and services 
we may not be successful in introducing new products and services in response to industry trends or developments in technology  or those new products may not achieve market acceptance 
as a result  we could lose business  be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients  or be subject to cost increases 
as a result  our business  financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 
consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions 
technology and other changes are allowing parties to use alternative methods to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks 
for example  consumers can now maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits 
consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks 
the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries  known as disintermediation  could result in the loss of fee income  as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits 
any resulting loss of deposits could impact our cost of funding  and  together with any lost income generated by this loss of business  could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 
our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions 
financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty or other relationships 
we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties  and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  
table of contents including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment banks  mutual and hedge funds  and other institutional clients 
as a result  defaults by  or even rumors or questions about  one or more financial services companies  or the financial services industry generally  have led to market wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client 
in addition  our credit risk may be exacerbated if the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us 
there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
changes in the policies of monetary authorities and other government action could adversely affect our profitability 
the results of operations of regions are affected by credit policies of monetary authorities  particularly the federal reserve 
the instruments of monetary policy employed by the federal reserve include open market operations in us government securities  changes in the discount rate or the federal funds rate on bank borrowings  and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits 
in view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets  we cannot predict possible future changes in interest rates  deposit levels  and loan demand on our business and earnings 
furthermore  ongoing military operations around the world  including those in response to terrorist attacks  may result in currency fluctuations  exchange controls  market disruption and other adverse effects  any of which may negatively impact our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we need to stay current on technological changes in order to compete and meet customer demands 
the financial services market  including banking services  is undergoing rapid changes with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
in addition to better serving customers  the effective use of technology increases efficiency and may enable us to reduce costs 
our future success may depend  in part  on our ability to use technology to provide products and services that provide convenience to customers and to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
some of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers 
as a result  our ability to effectively compete to retain or acquire new business may be impaired  and our business  financial condition or results of operations  may be adversely affected 
we are subject to a variety of operational risks  including reputational risk  legal risk and compliance risk  and the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders  which may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we are exposed to many types of operational risks  including reputational risk  legal and compliance risk  the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders  and unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors  including clerical or record keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems 
negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities  including lending practices  corporate governance and acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities 
negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and keep customers and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action 
actual or alleged conduct by regions can result in negative public opinion about our other business 
negative public opinion could also affect our credit ratings  which are important to our access to unsecured wholesale borrowings 
if personal  non public  confidential or proprietary information of customers in our possession were to be mishandled or misused  we could suffer significant regulatory consequences  reputational damage and financial loss 
such mishandling or misuse could include  for example  if such information were erroneously provided to 
table of contents parties who are not permitted to have the information  either by fault of our systems  employees  or counterparties  or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties 
because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions  certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified 
our necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions and our large transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect 
we also may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control for example  computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages  or natural disasters  disease pandemics or other damage to property or physical assets which may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability 
we are further exposed to the risk that our external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as we are and to the risk that we or our vendors business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate 
the occurrence of any of these risks could result in a diminished ability of us to operate our business for example  by requiring us to expend significant resources to correct the defect  as well as potential liability to clients  reputational damage and regulatory intervention  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations  perhaps materially 
we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure 
third parties provide key components of our business operations such as data processing  recording and monitoring transactions  online banking interfaces and services  internet connections and network access 
while we have selected these third party vendors carefully  we do not control their actions 
any problems caused by these third parties  including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor  failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes  failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services  could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business 
financial or operational difficulties of a third party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor s ability to serve us 
replacing these third party vendors could also create significant delay and expense 
accordingly  use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to our business operations 
our customers may pursue alternatives to bank deposits which could force us to rely on relatively more expensive sources of funding 
an outflow of deposits because customers seek investments with higher yields or greater financial stability  prefer to do business with our competitors  or otherwise could force us to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding to fund our business and meet withdrawal demands  adversely affecting our net interest margin 
we may also be forced  as a result of any outflow of deposits  to rely more heavily on equity to fund our business  resulting in greater dilution of our existing shareholders 
as a result  our business  financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 
our reported financial results depend on management s selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates 
our accounting policies and assumptions are fundamental to our reported financial condition and results of operations 
our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with generally accepted accounting principles and reflect management s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results 
in some cases  management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives  any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances  yet may result in our reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative 

table of contents certain accounting policies are critical to presenting our reported financial condition and results 
they require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain 
materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates 
these critical accounting policies include the allowance for credit losses  intangible assets  mortgage servicing rights  and income taxes 
because of the uncertainty of estimates involved in these matters  we may be required to do one or more of the following significantly increase the allowance for credit losses and or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the reserve provided  recognize significant impairment on our goodwill  other intangible assets and deferred tax asset balances  or significantly increase our accrued income taxes 
changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition 
from time to time  the financial accounting standards board and sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements 
these changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively  resulting in us restating prior period financial statements 
we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties 
in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties  we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of clients and counterparties  including financial statements and other financial information 
we also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and  with respect to financial statements  on reports of independent auditors if made available 
if this information is inaccurate  we may be subject to regulatory action  reputational harm or other adverse effects on the operation of our business  our financial condition and our results of operations 
we are exposed to risk of environmental liability when we take title to property 
in the course of our business  we may foreclose on and take title to real estate 
as a result  we could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties 
we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage  personal injury  investigation and clean up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property 
the costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial 
in addition  if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site  we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property 
if we become subject to significant environmental liabilities  our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
our information systems may experience an interruption or security breach 
we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure  interruption or security breach of our information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failure  interruption or security breach will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failure  interruption or security breach of our information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability 

table of contents the market price of shares of our common stock will fluctuate 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations or business prospects 
such risks may be affected by operating results that vary from the expectations of management  securities analysts and investors  developments in our business or in the financial sector generally  regulatory changes affecting our industry generally or our business and operations  the operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us  announcements of strategic developments  acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors  expectations of or actual equity dilution  changes in the credit  mortgage and real estate markets  including the markets for mortgage related securities  and changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions  such as interest or foreign exchange rates  stock  commodity  credit or asset valuations or volatility 
stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have shown considerable volatility in the recent past 
the market price of our common stock may continue to be subject to similar market fluctuations that may be unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 
increased volatility could result in a decline in the market price of our common stock 
we may not pay dividends on your common stock 
holders of shares of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments 
although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock  we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future 
this could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
also  participation in the cpp limits our ability to increase our dividend or to repurchase our common stock for so long as any securities issued under such program remain outstanding  as discussed in greater detail in the restrictions on dividends and repurchase of stock section of item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities of this annual report on form k 
regions has reduced its quarterly dividend to per share and does not expect to increase its quarterly dividend above such level for the foreseeable future 
regions is also subject to statutory and regulatory limitations on our ability to pay dividends on our common stock 
for example  it is the policy of the federal reserve that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of earnings  and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization s expected future needs  asset quality  and financial condition 
recently issued temporary guidance from the federal reserve states that our dividend policies will be assessed  among other things  against our ability to achieve basel iii capital ratio requirements 
moreover  the federal reserve will closely scrutinize any dividend payout ratios exceeding percent of after tax net income 
anti takeover laws and certain agreements and charter provisions may adversely affect share value 
certain provisions of state and federal law and our certificate of incorporation may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of us without our board of directors approval 
under federal law  subject to certain exemptions  a person  entity or group must notify the federal banking agencies before acquiring control of a bank holding company 
acquisition of percent or more of any class of voting stock of a bank holding company or state member bank  including shares of our common stock  creates a rebuttable presumption that the 
table of contents acquirer controls the bank holding company or state member bank 
also  as noted under the supervision and regulation section of item of this annual report on form k  a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve before  among other things  acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than percent of the voting shares of any bank  including regions bank 
there also are provisions in our certificate of incorporation that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt 
as a result  these statutory provisions and provisions in our certificate of incorporation could result in regions being less attractive to a potential acquirer 
future issuances of additional equity securities could result in dilution of your ownership 
we may determine from time to time to issue additional equity securities to raise additional capital  support growth  or to make acquisitions 
further  we may issue stock options or other stock grants to retain and motivate our employees 
these issuances of our securities could dilute the voting and economic interests of our existing shareholders 
future equity offerings could impair the value of our deferred tax assets and adversely affect our capital ratios 
our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
in general  an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by percent shareholders as defined in the code that exceeds percent as defined in the code over a rolling three year period 
any corporation experiencing an ownership change will generally be subject to an annual limitation on its deferred tax assets prior to the ownership change equal to the value of such corporation immediately before the ownership change  multiplied by the long term tax exempt rate subject to certain adjustments 
the annual limitation would be increased each year to the extent that there is an unused limitation in a prior year 
the limitation arising from an ownership change under section of the code on our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets would depend on the value of regions stock at the time of the ownership change 
as a result  future investments by new or existing percent shareholders or issuances of common equity could materially increase the risk that we could experience an ownership change in the future 
if we were to experience an ownership change under section of the code for any reason  the value of our deferred tax assets may be impaired and may cause a decrease in our financial position  results of operations and regulatory capital ratios

credit the distressed economy has increased the risk of default for many loan types 
regions entered with a concentration in investor real estate products in its southeastern footprint 
loans extended to real estate developers or investors where repayment depends on sales of real estate  especially those loans secured by land  single family developments and condominiums  experienced the most credit pressure 
income producing investor real estate  including loans secured by multi family and retail developments  also came under pressure 
additionally  the risk profile of home equity products  particularly second lien mortgages in florida  increased as real estate values fell and unemployment increased in that state 
in  credit risk began to moderate 
however  an elevated provision for loan losses of billion was the catalyst for the net loss available to common shareholders of million in internally criticized loans and total non accrual loans while still elevated  migrated in favorable directions during management is encouraged by these trends and is cautiously optimistic that credit metrics will continue to trend favorably 
however  unemployment remains high throughout regions footprint  property valuations continue to be pressured  and credit costs are expected to remain elevated  as compared to historical levels 
management has therefore maintained the allowance for credit losses at billion to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio

regions policy is to maintain a sufficient level of funding to meet projected cash needs  including all debt service  dividends  and maturities for the subsequent two years at the parent company and for acceptable periods at the bank and other affiliates 
the company s funding and contingency planning does not rely on unsecured sources  although these markets are periodically tested to ensure they are available 
maturities of loans and securities provide a constant flow of funds available for cash needs 
at december   the company s borrowing capacity with the federal reserve discount window was billion based on available collateral

deposit costs decreased from percent in to percent in  and stood at percent for the fourth quarter of however  the margin continues to be negatively affected by a persistently low interest rate environment  non performing asset levels  and maintenance of conservative balance sheet liquidity levels 
additionally  management expects the net interest margin to be pressured in the near term due in part to the recent portfolio rebalancing activity undertaken to further the company s capital and liquidity goals 
over the longer term  the eventual rise of benchmark interest rates will have a favorable impact on the net interest margin 
the company entered into an additional series of interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk to interest income if rates continue to remain low in the near term 
these swaps offer this protection while reducing asset sensitivity through management decision to de risk the securities portfolio also impacts the net interest margin 
at december   the securities portfolio almost exclusively consisted of agency guaranteed residential mortgage backed securities 
management expects to achieve a higher margin over the long term as excess liquidity is reinvested  the securities portfolio is repositioned  disciplined loan pricing is emphasized  the composition of the loan portfolio is migrated toward more consumer products and an advantageous deposit mix is maintained

certain amounts in prior year presentations have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation  except as otherwise noted 
regions profitability  like that of many other financial institutions  is dependent on its ability to generate revenue from net interest income and non interest income sources 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income regions receives on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest expense regions pays on interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits and borrowings 
regions net interest income is impacted by the size and mix of its balance sheet components and the interest rate spread between interest earned on its assets and interest paid on its liabilities 
non interest income includes fees from service charges on deposit accounts  brokerage  investment banking  capital markets  and trust activities  mortgage servicing and secondary marketing  insurance activities  and other customer services which regions provides 
results of operations are also affected by the provision for loan losses and non interest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits  occupancy  professional fees  fdic insurance  other real estate owned and other operating expenses  including income taxes 
in  regions non interest expense included a million regulatory charge related to morgan keegan company  inc morgan keegan 
in  regions non interest expense included a non cash billion goodwill impairment charge 
economic conditions  competition  new legislation and related rules impacting regulation of the financial services industry and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government significantly affect financial institutions  including regions 
lending and deposit activities and fee income generation are influenced by levels of business spending and investment  consumer income  consumer spending and savings  capital market activities  and competition among financial institutions  as well as customer preferences  interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing products in regions market areas 
regions business strategy has been and continues to be focused on providing a competitive mix of products and services  delivering quality customer service and maintaining a branch distribution network with offices in convenient locations 
acquisitions the acquisitions of banks and other financial services companies have historically contributed significantly to regions growth 
the acquisitions of other financial services companies have also allowed regions to better diversify its revenue stream and to offer additional products and services to its customers 
from time to time  regions evaluates potential bank and non bank acquisition candidates 
in february   regions acquired from the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic approximately million in deposits from a failed bank headquartered in henry county  georgia

on november   regions merged with amsouth bancorporation amsouth  headquartered in birmingham  alabama 
in the stock for stock merger  shares of regions were exchanged  on a tax free basis  for each share of amsouth common stock 
amsouth had total assets of approximately billion including goodwill and operated in six states at the time of the merger 
this transaction was accounted for as a purchase of percent of the voting interests of amsouth by regions and  accordingly  financial results for periods prior to november  have not been restated 
regions incurred approximately million in one time pre tax merger related costs to bring the two companies together 
regions recorded million of such costs in goodwill during this amount was subsequently adjusted down by million in the majority of merger costs flowed directly through the statements of operations 
these included million  million  and million in pre tax merger expenses during  and  respectively 
no merger expenses related to the amsouth transaction were recorded after the third quarter of dispositions during the first quarter of  through sales to three separate buyers  regions completed the divestiture of former amsouth branches having approximately billion in deposits and billion in loans 
these divestitures were required in markets where the merger may have affected competition 
on march   regions sold its wholly owned non conforming mortgage origination subsidiary  equifirst corporation equifirst for an initial sales price of approximately million 
the business related to equifirst has been accounted for as discontinued operations and the results are presented separately on the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented

table of contents overview regions reported a net loss available to common shareholders of million or per diluted common share in significant drivers of results include an elevated provision for loan losses and other real estate expenses  as well as a million regulatory charge related to morgan keegan 
these items were partially offset by higher net interest income 
net interest income was billion in compared to billion in the net interest margin taxable equivalent basis was percent in  compared to percent during the margin improvement was driven primarily by a decrease of basis points in the cost of interest bearing liabilities  while being partially offset by a basis point decline in the overall yield on interest earning assets 
this dynamic reflected efforts to improve deposit costs and pricing on loans  while managing the challenges posed by a low interest rate environment 
long term interest rates in particular remained low in  pressuring yields on fixed rate loan and securities portfolios  and contributed to the decline in the yield on taxable securities from percent in to percent in the overall costs of deposits improved from percent in to percent in  although short term interest rates eg fed funds remained relatively stable 
the product mix of deposits improved as well  as declines in higher cost certificates of deposits accompanied increases in other low cost checking  savings and money market products 
although the net interest margin increased in  the factors that have pressured it are likely to persist  including those directly and indirectly associated with the erosion of economic and industry conditions since late these factors include a continuation of a low level of interest rates  higher costs of new debt issuances  elevated non performing asset levels and costs associated with managing to prudent levels of liquidity risk 
the combination of these factors may even lead to a modest decline in margin in the near term from percent in the fourth quarter of additionally  management expects the net interest margin to be pressured in the near term due in part to the recent portfolio rebalancing activity to further the company s capital and liquidity goals 
however  regions balance sheet is in an asset sensitive position such that if economic conditions were to improve more rapidly  thereby resulting in a rise in interest rates  the net interest margin would likely respond favorably 
net charge offs totaled billion  or percent of average loans in compared to billion  or percent of average loans in the increased loss rate reflected seasoning of losses as the company moves through the credit cycle as well as the impact of opportunistic asset dispositions which increased charge offs and decreased average loan balances 
non performing assets decreased million between december  and december  to billion 
the provision for loan losses is used to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that  in management s judgment  is adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
during  the provision for loan losses decreased to billion compared to billion in the allowance for credit losses was billion  or percent of loans  at december  as compared to billion  or percent of loans  at december  the stabilization in the level of the allowance reflects moderating credit trends 
non interest income decreased to billion in from billion in the year over year decrease was due primarily to several items impacting with a lower or no corresponding impact on these items include gains from terminations of leveraged leases  which were largely offset by income taxes  a gain on extinguishment of debt realized in connection with the company s issuance of common stock in exchange for trust preferred securities  and gains related to transactions in visa stock 
lower mortgage income  resulting from market valuation adjustments for mortgage servicing rights and related derivatives  also drove the year over year decline 
the decreases were largely offset by higher gains from sales of securities in  as well as increases in non interest income attributable to service charges and brokerage  investment banking and capital markets income 
the impact of regulation e on service charges was less than anticipated  however  the company expects increased pressure on fee based revenues in light of pending regulatory changes 
see table gaap to non gaap reconciliation and table non interest income for further details 

table of contents non interest expense from continuing operations totaled billion in compared to billion in the year over year increase was driven largely by a million nondeductible regulatory charge related to morgan keegan  losses on early extinguishments of debt related to prepayment of federal home loan bank advances  and increased fdic premiums 
higher salaries and employee benefits and credit related costs such as other real estate owned expense also contributed to the increase 
these items were partially offset by lower other than temporary impairment on securities and a fdic special assessment which did not repeat in see table non interest expense including non gaap reconciliation for further details 
total loans decreased by billion  or percent in  driven primarily by a strategic decision to lower exposure to investor real estate 
decreases in residential first mortgage  home equity  and indirect loans also contributed to the year over year decrease primarily resulting from consumers decisions to de leverage 
total deposits decreased billion in to billion at december   primarily due to maturities of time deposits 
however  low cost customer deposits increased billion  or percent in regions tier common and tier capital ratios were percent and percent at december  pro forma calculations indicate that the corresponding basel iii ratios  based on regions current understanding of the guidelines  are approximately percent and percent  above the respective basel iii minimums of percent and percent 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act which was signed into law on july  provides some level of clarity regarding how the industry and regions specific business will be affected moving forward 
however  provisions in the dodd frank act remain subject to regulatory rule making and implementation  and it will be some time before the business implications are completely defined 
proposed rules regarding regulation of interchange income would have a significant negative impact on non interest revenues if adopted as drafted 
in  regions collected million in debit card income 
based on the current proposed rule  absent any mitigating actions  revenues from debit card income would likely be reduced to approximately one quarter of current levels  assuming a cap of cents per transaction 
non interest expenses eg  fdic insurance premiums  compliance costs  and other regulatory fees will also be negatively impacted by provisions included in the legislation 
additionally  trust preferred securities will be phased out as an allowable component of tier capital over a three year period beginning in table gaap to non gaap reconciliation presents computations of earnings and certain other financial measures excluding merger  goodwill impairment and regulatory charges  including efficiency ratio  average tangible common stockholders equity  end of period tangible common stockholders equity and tier common equity  all of which are non gaap 
merger  goodwill impairment and regulatory charges are included in financial results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
regions believes the exclusion of merger  goodwill impairment and regulatory charges in expressing earnings and certain other financial measures  including earnings per common share  excluding merger  goodwill impairment and regulatory charges and return on average tangible common stockholders equity  excluding merger  goodwill impairment and regulatory charges provides a meaningful base for period to period and company to company comparisons  which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the company and predicting future performance 
these non gaap financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of regions business  because management does not consider these charges to be relevant to ongoing operating results 
management and the board of directors utilize these non gaap financial measures as follows preparation of regions operating budgets monthly financial performance reporting monthly close out flash reporting of consolidated results management only presentations to investors of company performance 
table of contents regions believes that presenting these non gaap financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the company on the same basis as that applied by management and the board of directors 
the third quarter of was the final quarter for merger charges related to the amsouth acquisition 
the efficiency ratio  which is a measure of productivity  is generally calculated as non interest expense divided by total revenue on a fully tax equivalent basis 
management uses the efficiency ratio to monitor performance and believes this measure provides meaningful information to investors 
non interest expense gaap is presented excluding certain adjustments to arrive at adjusted non interest expense non gaap  which is the numerator for the efficiency ratio 
net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis gaap and non interest income gaap are added together to arrive at total revenue 
adjustments are made to arrive at adjusted total revenue non gaap  which is the denominator for the efficiency ratio 
regions believes that the exclusion of these adjustments provides a meaningful base for period to period comparisons  which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the company and predicting future performance 
these non gaap financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of regions business 
it is possible that the activities related to the adjustments may recur  however  management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations 
regions believes that presentation of these non gaap financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the company on the same basis as that applied by management 
tangible common stockholders equity ratios have become a focus of some investors in analyzing the capital position of the company absent the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock 
traditionally  the federal reserve and other banking regulatory bodies have assessed a bank s capital adequacy based on tier capital  the calculation of which is codified in federal banking regulations 
in connection with the federal reserve s supervisory capital assessment program scap  these regulators began supplementing their assessment of the capital adequacy of a bank based on a variation of tier capital  known as tier common equity 
while not codified  analysts and banking regulators have assessed regions capital adequacy using the tangible common stockholders equity and or the tier common equity measure 
because tangible common stockholders equity and tier common equity are not formally defined by gaap or codified in the federal banking regulations  these measures are considered to be non gaap financial measures and other entities may calculate them differently than regions disclosed calculations 
since analysts and banking regulators may assess regions capital adequacy using tangible common stockholders equity and tier common equity  regions believes that it is useful to provide investors the ability to assess regions capital adequacy on these same bases 
tier common equity is often expressed as a percentage of risk weighted assets 
under the risk based capital framework  a bank s balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are assigned to one of four broad risk categories 
the aggregated dollar amount in each category is then multiplied by the risk weighting assigned to that category 
the resulting weighted values from each of the four categories are added together and this sum is the risk weighted assets total that  as adjusted  comprises the denominator of certain risk based capital ratios 
tier capital is then divided by this denominator risk weighted assets to determine the tier capital ratio 
adjustments are made to tier capital to arrive at tier common equity non gaap 
tier common equity is also divided by the risk weighted assets to determine the tier common equity ratio 
the amounts disclosed as risk weighted assets are calculated consistent with banking regulatory requirements 
non gaap financial measures have inherent limitations  are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited 
to mitigate these limitations  regions has policies and procedures in place to identify and address expenses that qualify for non gaap presentation  including authorization and system controls to ensure accurate period to period comparisons 
although these non gaap financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company  they have limitations as analytical tools  and should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap

critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing financial information  management is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  income and expenses for the periods shown 
the accounting principles followed by regions and the methods of applying these principles conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the us and general banking practices 
estimates and assumptions most significant to regions are related primarily to the allowance for credit losses  fair value measurements  intangible assets goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets  mortgage servicing rights and income taxes  and are summarized in the following discussion and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses allowance consists of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments 
these two components reflect management s judgment of probable credit losses 
table of contents inherent in the portfolio and unfunded credit commitments at the balance sheet date 
a full discussion of these estimates and other factors are included in the allowance for credit losses section within the discussion of credit risk  found in a later section of this report  and note allowance for credit losses to the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance is sensitive to a variety of internal factors  such as portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings  as well as external factors  such as interest rates and the general health of the economy 
management reviews different assumptions for variables that could result in increases or decreases in probable inherent credit losses  which may materially impact regions estimate of the allowance and results of operations 
management s estimate of the allowance for the commercial and investor real estate portfolio segments could be affected by estimates of losses inherent in various product types as a result of fluctuations in the general economy  developments within a particular industry  or changes in an individual s credit due to factors particular to that credit  such as competition  management or business performance 
a percent increase or decrease in the estimated loss rates on all pools of loans with similar risk characteristics would change estimated inherent losses by approximately million 
for residential real estate mortgages  home equity lending and other consumer related loans  individual products are reviewed on a group basis or in loan pools eg  residential real estate mortgage pools 
losses can be affected by such factors as collateral value  loss severity  the economy and other uncontrollable factors 
a percent increase or decrease in the estimated loss rates on these loans would change estimated inherent losses by approximately million 
additionally  the estimate of the allowance for the entire portfolio may change due to modifications in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding and general economic conditions  as evidenced by changes in real estate demand and values  interest rates  unemployment rates  bankruptcy filings  fluctuations in the gross domestic product  and the effects of weather and natural disasters such as droughts and hurricanes 
each has the ability to result in actual loan losses that could differ from originally estimated amounts 
the pro forma inherent loss analysis presented above demonstrates the sensitivity of the allowance to key assumptions 
this sensitivity analysis does not reflect an expected outcome 
fair value measurements a portion of the company s assets and liabilities is carried at fair value  with changes in fair value recorded either in earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
these include trading account assets  securities available for sale  mortgage loans held for sale  mortgage servicing rights and derivatives net 
from time to time  the estimation of fair value also affects other loans held for sale  which are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value 
fair value determination is also relevant for certain other assets such as foreclosed property and other real estate  which are recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan property or fair value  less estimated costs to sell the property 
for example  the fair value of other real estate is determined based on recent appraisals by third parties and other market information  less estimated selling costs 
adjustments to the appraised value are made if management becomes aware of changes in the fair value of specific properties or property types 
the determination of fair value also impacts certain other assets that are periodically evaluated for impairment using fair value estimates  including goodwill  other identifiable intangible assets and impaired loans 
fair value is generally defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price as opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability an entry price  in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions 
while management uses judgment when determining the price at which willing market participants would transact when there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity for the asset or liability in relation to normal market activity  management s objective is to determine the point within the range of fair value estimates that is most representative of a sale to a third party financial investor under current market conditions 
the value to the company if the asset or liability were held to maturity is not included in the fair value estimates 

table of contents a fair value measure should reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  including the assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique  the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset and the risk of nonperformance 
fair value is measured based on a variety of inputs the company utilizes 
fair value may be based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets level valuations 
if market prices are not available  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market are used level valuations 
where observable market data is not available  the valuation is generated from model based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market  but observable based on company specific data level valuations 
these unobservable assumptions reflect the company s own estimates for assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
valuation techniques typically include option pricing models  discounted cash flow models and similar techniques  but may also include the use of market prices of assets or liabilities that are not directly comparable to the subject asset or liability 
see note fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of determining fair value 
intangible assets regions intangible assets consist primarily of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets primarily core deposit intangibles 
goodwill totaled billion at both december  and and is allocated to each of regions reportable segments each a reporting unit  at which level goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more often if events and circumstances indicate impairment may exist refer to note significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of when regions tests goodwill for impairment 
adverse changes in the economic environment  declining operations of the reporting unit  or other factors could result in a decline in the estimated implied fair value of goodwill 
if the estimated implied fair value is less than the carrying amount  a loss would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount to the estimated implied fair value 
a test of goodwill for impairment consists of two steps 
in step one  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount 
to the extent that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value  impairment is not indicated and no further testing is required 
conversely  if the fair value of the reporting unit is below its carrying amount  step two must be performed 
step two consists of determining the implied fair value of goodwill  which is the net difference between the after tax valuation adjustments of assets and liabilities and the valuation adjustment to equity from step one of the reporting unit 
the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using two approaches and several key assumptions 
regions utilizes the capital asset pricing model capm in order to derive the base discount rate 
the inputs to the capm include the year risk free rate  year beta for a select peer set  and the market risk premium based on published data 
once the output of the capm is determined  a size premium is added also based on a published source as well as a company specific risk premium  which is an estimate determined by the company and meant to compensate for the risk inherent in the future cash flow projections and inherent differences such as business model and market perception of risk between regions and the peer set 
the table below summarizes the discount rate used in the goodwill impairment tests of the banking treasury reporting unit for the reporting periods indicated th quarter rd quarter nd quarter st quarter th quarter discount rate the decrease in discount rate from the fourth quarter test to the first quarter test was driven primarily by a reduction in the company specific risk premium  which was lowered as a result of updated forecasts that reduced uncertainty from the projected cash flows 

table of contents in the fourth quarter of  regions reduced the company specific component of its discount rate to reflect several positive factors that occurred during the period  as well as factors which reduced the uncertainty of future cash flow projections 
specifically  the company earned a profit and experienced improving credit metrics  including lower non performing assets and lower gross inflows of non performing loans than in the third quarter of additionally  regions experienced lower levels of criticized loans  a leading indicator of loan losses see note allowance for credit losses to the consolidated financial statements for further details  including a definition of criticized loans 
the company also completed its three year strategic plan  which reflected improving credit trends and included additional clarity around future cash flows that were driven by a proposed rule issued by the federal reserve governing debit card income and the announcements in the fourth quarter of and january of of pending non distressed  orderly sales of financial institutions of comparable size and or footprint to regions 
additionally  the basel committee finalized its capital framework  which provided additional clarity on future equity requirements that impact the projections of future cash flows 
in the judgment of management  these factors outweighed the downgrades of regions debt to below investment grade during the fourth quarter of  as well as new rules which are expected to increase fdic insurance premiums 
in estimating future cash flows  a balance sheet as of the test date and a statement of operations for the last twelve months of activity for the reporting unit are compiled 
from that point  future balance sheets and statements of operations are projected based on the inputs discussed below 
cash flows are based on expected future capitalization requirements due to balance sheet growth and anticipated changes in regulatory capital requirements 
the baseline cash flows utilized in all models correspond to the most recent internal forecasts and or budgets that range from to years 
these internal forecasts are based on inputs developed in the company s capital planning processes 
refer to the discussion of intangible assets in note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these approaches and note intangible assets for a discussion of the assumptions 
the fair values of assets and liabilities are determined using an exit price concept

in the fourth quarter of  regions performed its goodwill impairment tests for the banking treasury reporting unit  which resulted in an implied fair value of goodwill of approximately billion and a goodwill impairment charge of billion 
throughout and continuing into the first half of  in the banking treasury reporting unit  the credit quality of regions loan portfolio declined  which contributed to increased losses as well as elevated non performing loan levels 
accordingly  regions performed tests of goodwill for impairment during each quarter of and during the second  third and fourth quarters of in a manner consistent with the test conducted in the fourth quarter of the long term fair value of equity was determined using both income and market approaches discussed in note intangible assets of the consolidated financial statements 
the results of these calculations continued to indicate that the fair value of the banking treasury reporting unit was less than its carrying amount 
as of december   the carrying amount and fair value of the banking treasury reporting unit were billion and billion  respectively  while the carrying amount of goodwill for the reporting unit was billion 
therefore  step two of the goodwill impairment test was performed 
in step two  the fair values of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities  including the loan portfolio  intangible assets  time deposits  debt  and others were calculated 
once the fair values were determined  deferred tax adjustments were calculated as applicable 
the after tax effects of the step two adjustments  which were primarily write downs of assets to fair value  exceeded any reductions in the value of common equity determined in step one  therefore  the results were no impairment for the banking treasury reporting unit 
since the second quarter of  the fair values of net assets and liabilities of the banking treasury reporting unit have increased faster than the value of this reporting unit 
should the fair values of net assets continue to increase more rapidly than the fair value of this reporting unit  goodwill could be impaired in future periods 

table of contents specific factors as of the date of filing the financial statements that could negatively impact the assumptions used in assessing goodwill for impairment include disparities in the level of fair value changes in net assets compared to equity  adverse business trends resulting from litigation and or regulatory actions  increasing fdic premiums  higher loan losses  lengthened forecasts of unemployment in excess of percent beyond  future increased minimum regulatory capital requirements above current thresholds refer to note regulatory capital requirements and restrictions to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of current minimum regulatory requirements  future federal rules and regulations resulting from the dodd frank act  and or a protraction in the current low level of interest rates beyond the following tables present an analysis of independent changes in market factors or significant assumptions that could adversely impact the carrying balance of goodwill in the banking treasury reporting unit and the outcome of the step one tests for the investment banking brokerage trust and insurance reporting units impact to the carrying value of goodwill banking treasury reporting unit change in discount rate estimated amount of impairment in millions a change in tangible book value multipliers b a improvement in loan fair values percentage points a percentage points percentage points a represents the point at which the implied fair value of goodwill would approximate its carrying value

d for insurance  represents the percent decline in the x multiplier for the last twelve months of net income and is before the percent control premium utilized for this metric 
see note for further details 

table of contents the sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future performance 
changes in implied fair value based on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear 
also  the effect of an adverse variation in a particular assumption on the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated without changing any other assumption  while in reality changes in one factor may result in changes in another which may either magnify or counteract the effect of the change 
other identifiable intangible assets  primarily core deposit intangibles  are reviewed at least annually for events or circumstances which could impact the recoverability of the intangible asset  such as loss of core deposits  increased competition or adverse changes in the economy 
to the extent another identifiable intangible asset is deemed unrecoverable  an impairment loss would be recorded to reduce the carrying amount 
these events or circumstances  if they occur  could be material to regions operating results for any particular reporting period but the potential impact cannot be reasonably estimated 
mortgage servicing rights regions estimates the fair value of its mortgage servicing rights in order to record them at fair value on the balance sheet 
although sales of mortgage servicing rights do occur  mortgage servicing rights do not trade in an active market with readily observable market prices and the exact terms and conditions of sales may not be readily available  and are therefore level valuations in the fair value hierarchy previously discussed 
specific characteristics of the underlying loans greatly impact the estimated value of the related mortgage servicing rights 
as a result  regions stratifies its mortgage servicing portfolio on the basis of certain risk characteristics  including loan type and contractual note rate  and values its mortgage servicing rights using discounted cash flow modeling techniques 
these techniques require management to make estimates regarding future net servicing cash flows  taking into consideration historical and forecasted mortgage loan prepayment rates and discount rates 
changes in interest rates  prepayment speeds or other factors impact the fair value of mortgage servicing rights which impacts earnings 
based on a hypothetical sensitivity analysis  regions estimates that a reduction in primary mortgage market rates of basis points and basis points would reduce the december  fair value of mortgage servicing rights by approximately percent million and percent million  respectively 
conversely  basis point and basis point increases in these rates would increase the december  fair value of mortgage servicing rights by approximately percent million and percent million  respectively 
the pro forma fair value analysis presented above demonstrates the sensitivity of fair values to hypothetical changes in primary mortgage rates 
this sensitivity analysis does not reflect an expected outcome 
refer to the mortgage servicing rights discussion in the balance sheet analysis section found later in this report 
income taxes accrued income taxes are reported as a component of other assets in the consolidated balance sheets and reflect management s estimate of income taxes to be paid or received 
deferred income taxes represent the amount of future income taxes to be paid or received and are accounted for using the asset and liability method 
the net balance is reported in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company determines the realization of the net deferred tax asset based upon an evaluation of the four possible sources of taxable income the future reversals of taxable temporary differences  future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  taxable income in prior carryback years  and tax planning strategies 
in projecting future taxable income  the company utilizes forecasted pre tax earnings  adjusts for the estimated book tax differences and incorporates assumptions  including the amounts of income allocable to taxing jurisdictions 
these assumptions require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates the company uses to manage the underlying businesses 
the realization of the deferred tax assets could be reduced in the future if these estimates are significantly different than forecasted 
for a detailed discussion of realization of deferred tax assets  refer to the income taxes section found later in this report 

table of contents the company is subject to income tax in the us and multiple state and local jurisdictions 
the tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction may be interpreted differently in certain situations  which could result in a range of outcomes 
thus  the company is required to exercise judgment regarding the application of these tax laws and regulations 
in the event a dispute with a taxing authority arises  the company will evaluate and recognize tax liabilities related to the tax uncertainties 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities 
the company s estimate of accrued income taxes  deferred income taxes and income tax expense can also change in any period as a result of new legislative or judicial guidance impacting tax positions  as well as changes in income tax rates 
any changes  if they occur  can be significant to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
operating results general regions reported a net loss available to common shareholders of million in  compared to a net loss available to common shareholders of billion in the lower loss in was primarily reflective of moderation in credit quality within the company s loan portfolio 
however  the provision for loan losses remained elevated 
net interest income and margin net interest income interest income less interest expense is regions principal source of income and is one of the most important elements of regions ability to meet its overall performance goals 
net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased percent to billion in from billion in despite a decrease in the level of average earning assets  from billion in to billion in the increase in the net interest margin to percent in from percent in was sufficient to offset the impact of the smaller balance sheet size 
comparing to  interest earning asset yields were lower  decreasing basis points on average 
however  interest bearing liability rates were also lower  declining by basis points  which was more than enough improvement in funding costs to offset the drop in interest earning asset yields 
as a result  the net interest rate spread increased basis points to percent in as compared to percent in continued low levels of long term interest rates affected interest earning asset yields through their influence on the behavior and pricing of fixed rate loans and securities 
longer term rates remained at historical low levels and fluctuated throughout the year 
the yield on the benchmark year us treasury note ranged from a high of percent to a low of percent  and for the year decreased basis points  ending the year at percent 
persistently low long term rates can incent fixed rate borrowers to accelerate reductions or prepayments of existing loans  often at lower rates of interest 
this results in pressure on yields for portfolios that have a significant concentration of fixed rate loans 
the taxable investment securities portfolio  which contains significant residential fixed rate exposure  for example  decreased in yield from percent in to percent in the negative influence of low  long term interest rates on net interest margin  however  was offset by improvements in liability costs 
the federal funds rate and the prime rate  which are influential drivers of loan and deposit pricing on the shorter end of the yield curve  remained low at approximately percent and percent  respectively  throughout  essentially unchanged from the previous year end level 
despite the lack of movement in short term rates compared to historic lows  deposit costs improved considerably from percent in to percent in there was substantial improvement in costs in every deposit category  including average money market accounts which declined from percent to percent  and yet experienced an increase in average total balance from billion in to billion in the improvement in overall deposit cost was also attributable to a less costly mix of deposits 
for example  average time deposits declined from billion in to billion in meanwhile  average non interest bearing customer deposits increased from billion in to billion in

the computation of taxable equivalent net interest income is based on the statutory federal income tax rate of percent  adjusted for applicable state income taxes net of the related federal tax benefit 
net interest income and interest rate spread are also affected by the actions taken to manage interest rate risk 
as described in the market risk interest rate risk section of md a  regions employs multiple tools in order to manage the risk of variability in net interest income attributable to changes in interest rates 
among these tools are interest rate derivatives 
in  net interest income attributable to interest rate derivatives for hedging purposes was million versus million in the mix of interest earning assets can also affect the interest rate spread 
regions primary types of interest earning assets are loans and investment securities 
certain types of interest earning assets have historically 
table of contents generated larger spreads  for example  loans typically generate larger spreads than other assets  such as securities  federal funds sold or securities purchased under agreement to resell 
however  in  the spread on loans remained depressed due to lower interest rates and a higher level of loans on non accrual status 
average interest earning assets at december  totaled billion  a decrease of billion as compared to the prior year  or percent 
while average earning assets declined during  the mix changed somewhat  reflecting higher securities balances on average and a decline in average loans due to decreased loan demand and run off of investor real estate 
also affecting the interest rate spread was a continued elevated amount of interest bearing deposits in other banks included in other interest earning assets in table  primarily the federal reserve bank  as a result of the company s liquidity management process 
these funds generate a significantly lower spread than loans or securities 
average loans as a percentage of average interest earning assets were percent in and percent in the categories  which are comprised of interest earning assets  are shown in table consolidated average daily balances and yield rate analysis 
the proportion of average interest earning assets to average total assets measures the effectiveness of management s efforts to invest available funds into the most profitable interest earning vehicles and represented percent for both and this measure was consistent with the prior year as the overwhelming majority of the decline in total assets in was in interest earning assets 
funding for regions interest earning assets comes from interest bearing and non interest bearing sources 
another significant factor affecting the net interest margin is the percentage of interest earning assets funded by interest bearing liabilities 
the percentage of average interest earning assets funded by average interest bearing liabilities was percent in and percent in  also affected by the aforementioned increase in deposits in other banks 
table volume and yield rate variances provides additional information with which to analyze the changes in net interest income 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is used to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that  in management s judgment  is adequate to cover losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date 
during  the provision for loan losses was billion and net charge offs were billion 
this compares to a provision for loan losses of billion and net charge offs of billion in the decrease in the provision over charge offs reflects moderating credit quality 
for further discussion and analysis of the total allowance for credit losses  see the risk management section found later in this report 
see also note allowance for credit losses to the consolidated financial statements 
non interest income non interest income represents fees and income derived from sources other than interest earning assets 
table non interest income provides a detail of the components of non interest income 
non interest income totaled billion in compared to billion in the decrease in non interest income is primarily due to revenue generated from unwinding certain leveraged lease transactions in however  this decrease in revenue was offset by a reduction in the related income tax expense  resulting in an insignificant aggregate impact to net income 
excluding the leveraged lease terminations  results reflected an increase in service charges income  brokerage  investment banking and capital markets income  and securities gains 
offsetting these increases  mortgage income declined  resulting from market valuation adjustments for mortgage servicing rights and related derivatives 
non interest income excluding securities transactions and leveraged lease gains as a percent of total revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was percent in and 
table of contents table non interest income year ended december in millions service charges on deposit accounts brokerage  investment banking and capital markets mortgage income trust department income securities gains losses  net insurance commissions and fees leveraged lease termination gains gain on early extinguishment of debt visa related gains commercial credit fee income bank owned life insurance other miscellaneous income service charges on deposit accounts income from service charges on deposit accounts increased percent and totaled billion in both and this modest increase was due to a higher level of customer transactions and new account growth that began in and continued into these factors were slightly offset by policy changes  as well as changes related to regulation e 
service charges will continue to be negatively impacted going forward by the policy changes and new regulations 
interchange income  which is included in service charges on deposit accounts  will be impacted by the federal reserve s rulemaking required by section of the dodd frank act 
in december  the federal reserve issued a proposed rule that would establish debit card interchange fee standards based upon one of two proposed alternatives 
one alternative is an issuer specific standard with a safe harbor set at cents per transaction 
the other alternative is a stand alone cap set at cents per transaction 
neither alternative makes a distinction between pin or signature transactions and under both alternatives  the interchange fee will be much lower than cents per transaction which is the average amount charged for all debit transactions according to the federal reserve s study on interchange transactions 
total revenues from debit card income at regions were million in and without mitigating actions could potentially be negatively impacted going forward 
based on the current proposed rule  regions bank s revenues from interchange fees would likely be reduced to approximately one quarter of current levels  based on the cent alternative described above 
while the final regulations are not yet known  they may have an adverse affect on regions business  financial condition or results of operations 
brokerage  investment banking and capital markets and trust department income regions primary source of brokerage  investment banking and capital markets and trust revenue is its subsidiary  morgan keegan 
morgan keegan s revenues are predominantly recorded in the brokerage  investment banking and capital markets  as well as trust department income lines of the consolidated statements of operations  while a smaller portion is reported in other non interest income 
as of december   morgan keegan employed approximately  financial advisors 
morgan keegan contributed billion in total revenues in both and 
table of contents total brokerage  investment banking and capital markets revenues increased percent to billion in from million in  primarily due to an increase in the investment banking and private client brokerage services divisions 
results for reflect strength in these divisions  which is due in part to strategic acquisitions that were made in specialized industries in recent years 
customer and trust assets under management were approximately billion and billion  respectively  at year end compared to approximately billion and billion  respectively  at year end the rise in assets under management is primarily driven by a higher amount of asset inflows and higher end of period asset valuations than in the prior year 
revenues from the private client division increased percent to million  and accounted for percent of morgan keegan s total revenue in  compared to million or percent in fixed income capital markets revenues decreased million to million  as compared to million in  although revenues remained higher than in previous years  driven by institutional customers demand for government  mortgage backed and municipal securities 
equity capital markets revenue was negatively impacted by the financial turmoil beginning in late and continuing through equity capital markets revenues totaled million in  compared to million in investment banking revenues increased million to million as the division had success within its specialized industries  such as oil and gas  healthcare and technology 
trust revenues increased percent to million in  impacted by higher average asset valuations 
the asset management division produced million of revenue in compared to million in  pressured by a lower amount of fees from commissions

fdic premiums and special assessment fdic premiums increased in by million to million 
the increases resulted from higher premium rates applied to a higher level of insured deposit balances 
on october   the fdic increased the rates banks pay for deposit insurance  while at the same time making adjustments to the system that determines the rate a bank pays the fdic 
under this and additional proposals  the assessment rate schedule was raised on january  the bank regulatory agencies ratings  comprised of regions bank s capital  asset quality  management  earnings  liquidity and sensitivity to risk  along with its long term debt issuer ratings and financial ratios are the primary factors in determining fdic insurance premiums 
during early  regions utilized its remaining assessment credits  which had previously offset a substantial portion of premium cost 
regions qualified for a credit of approximately million  which was applied toward premiums in  and  thereby exhausting the credit 
under existing federal regulations  every fdic insured institution will pay some level of deposit insurance assessments regardless of the level of the designated reserve ratio 
regions incurred a million special assessment in to help replenish the deposit insurance fund 
additionally  the fdic required all institutions to prepay  by december   estimated assessments for all of  and based on the fourth quarter assessment rate 
in february  the fdic adopted a final rule the new assessment rule to revise the deposit insurance assessment system for large institutions 
the new assessment rule changed the assessment base from deposits as the basis and utilizes a risk based approach which calculates the assessment using average consolidated assets minus average tangible equity 
implementation of the new assessment rule is expected to result in an increase in fdic expense beginning in the second quarter of for a more detailed discussion of the fdic insurance assessment methodology and proposed changes  see the supervision and regulation fdic insurance assessments section of item business of this annual report on form k

table of contents against morgan keegan  morgan asset management and certain of their employees for violations of federal and state securities laws and nasd rules relating to certain funds previously administered by morgan keegan and morgan asset management 
based on the status of settlement negotiations  regions believed that a loss on the matter was probable and reasonably estimable 
accordingly  at june   morgan keegan recorded a non tax deductible million charge representing the estimate of probable loss 
settlement negotiations and trial preparations are ongoing 
refer to note commitments  contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
other miscellaneous expenses other miscellaneous expenses include communications  postage  supplies  credit related costs and business development services 
other miscellaneous expenses decreased million to million in the decline in was driven by various categories  including those listed above 
income taxes the company s income tax benefit for was million compared to a tax benefit of million in  resulting in an effective tax rate of percent and percent  respectively 
the increase in income tax benefit reflects the impact of the decline in the number and amount of leveraged lease terminations offset by the recognition of the nondeductible regulatory charge and the decrease in the consolidated pre tax loss 
the company s effective tax rate is affected by recurring items such as affordable housing tax credits  bank owned life insurance and tax exempt income  which are expected to be consistent in the near term 
the effective tax rate is also affected by one time items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period to period  such as the termination of certain leveraged leases and expenses that are nondeductible for income tax purposes 
accordingly  future period effective tax rates may not be comparable to the current period 
at december   the company reported a net deferred tax asset of billion 
of this amount  million was generated from differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the corresponding tax bases of assets and liabilities  of which a significant portion relates to the allowance for loan losses 
these net deferred tax assets have not yet reduced taxable income and therefore  do not have a set expiration date 
the remaining million net deferred tax asset balance relates to tax carryforwards that have defined expiration dates which are typically or years from the date of creation 
of the million  million of this deferred tax asset is related to tax carryforwards that have expiration dates prior to the tax year  and a valuation allowance of million exists against these amounts 
management s determination of the realization of the net deferred tax asset is based upon an evaluation of the four possible sources of taxable income the future reversals of taxable temporary differences  future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  taxable income in prior carryback years  and tax planning strategies 
in making a conclusion  management has evaluated all available positive and negative evidence impacting these sources of taxable income 
the primary sources of positive and negative evidence impacting taxable income are summarized below 
positive evidence history of earnings the company has a strong history of generating earnings and has demonstrated positive earnings in of the last years with the prior three years results of operations being impacted by unprecedented credit losses 
absent the billion goodwill impairment charge during  which had no impact on taxable net income reported on the company s tax returns  the company would have generated positive earnings during that year leaving only and in loss positions 
the company did not generate any federal net operating losses or tax credit carryforwards until  thus there is no history of significant tax carryforwards expiring unused 

table of contents reversals of taxable temporary differences the company anticipates that future reversals of taxable temporary differences  including the accretion of taxable temporary differences related to leveraged leases acquired in the amsouth merger  can absorb up to approximately billion of deferred tax assets 
creation of future taxable income at december   the company utilized all taxable income in prior carryback years 
the company has projected future taxable income that will be sufficient to absorb the remaining deferred tax assets after the reversal of future taxable temporary differences 
the taxable income forecasting process utilizes the forecasted pre tax earnings and adjusts for book tax differences that will be exempt from taxation  primarily tax exempt interest income and bank owned life insurance  as well as temporary book tax differences including the allowance for loan losses 
the projections relied upon for this process are consistent with those used in the goodwill impairment test and are sourced from the company s economic forecasting process 
strong capital position at december   the company had a tier capital ratio of percent  substantially above the percent minimum standard to be well capitalized 
also  the total capital ratio of percent substantially exceeds the percent minimum standard to be well capitalized 
the company s tier common ratio non gaap was percent at december  see table gaap to non gaap reconciliation for further details 
the board of governors of the federal reserve system has identified percent as the level of tier common capital sufficient to withstand adverse economic scenarios 
ability to implement tax planning strategies the company has the ability to implement tax planning strategies to maximize the realization of deferred tax assets  such as the sale of appreciated assets 
as an example  during  the company reported net pre tax gains of million from the sale of securities available for sale 
at december   the company s portfolio of securities available for sale had million of gross unrealized pre tax gains which could absorb million of deferred tax assets  which management would consider being a tax planning strategy to maximize the realization of the deferred tax assets 
negative evidence cumulative loss position the company is currently in a three year cumulative loss position 
excluding the billion goodwill impairment charge during and the million regulatory charge taken in  as these items were nondeductible for tax purposes  the cumulative pre tax loss position for through is billion 
the cumulative loss has resulted from the unprecedented provision for loan losses of billion during these periods  which management believes will continue to stabilize in future periods 
during  the provision for loan losses decreased million to billion  as compared to the provision for loan losses of billion in additionally  regions reported positive net income available to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of  providing positive evidence regarding the company s earnings 
the company believes the positive evidence  when considered in its entirety  outweighs the negative evidence of recent pre tax losses 
see note summary of significant accounting policies and note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about income taxes 
balance sheet analysis at december   regions reported total assets of billion compared to billion at the end of  a decrease of approximately billion or percent 
the balance sheet decline reflects a decrease in loans outstanding  primarily investor real estate balances  as well as a decrease in trading account assets

the following sections describe the composition of the portfolio classes in table and explain variations in balances from the year end 
see the credit risk section later in this report for discussion of risk characteristics in these categories and regions management of those risks 
commercial the commercial category includes commercial and industrial  representing loans to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs  equipment purchases and other expansion projects 
commercial also includes owner occupied commercial real estate loans to operating businesses  which are loans for long term financing of land and buildings  and are repaid by cash flow generated by business operations 
owner occupied construction loans are made to commercial businesses for the development of land or construction of a building where the repayment is derived from revenues generated from the business of the borrower 
during  total commercial loan balances increased percent  initially driven by growth experienced in certain specialty lending groups such as healthcare and energy in the texas  tennessee and georgia markets 
these industries have higher capital needs 
later in  the growth continued more broadly across other categories and markets 
investor real estate loans for real estate development are repaid through cash flow related to the operation  sale or refinance of the property 
this portfolio segment includes extensions of credit to real estate developers or investors where repayment is dependent on the sale of real estate or income generated from the real estate collateral 
a portion of regions investor real estate portfolio segment is comprised of loans secured by residential product types land  single family and condominium loans within regions markets 
additionally  this category includes loans made to finance income producing properties such as apartment buildings  office and industrial buildings  and retail shopping centers 
the investor real estate loan segment decreased billion from balances primarily due to strategic decisions to reduce the concentration in investor real estate in response to credit risk and economic pressure 
regions goal is to reduce the investor real estate portfolio segment below one hundred percent of regions bank s risk based capital  which would have been approximately billion as of december  a full discussion of these developments is included in the credit risk section later in this report 

table of contents residential first mortgage residential first mortgage loans represent loans to consumers to finance a residence 
these loans are typically financed over a to year term and  in most cases  are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence 
these loans experienced a million decline to billion in  primarily due to a million sale of residential first mortgages in the fourth quarter of in order to improve the company s capital and liquidity profile 
lower mortgage origination volume due to decreased net new refinance activity in as compared to also contributed to the decrease 
mortgage originations totaled billion in as compared to billion in also  property values continued to decline  new and used home sales remained at historically low levels and credit markets contracted in general 
see the credit risk section later in this report for additional discussion 
home equity home equity lending includes both home equity loans and lines of credit 
this type of lending  which is secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower s residence  allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home 
real estate market values as of the time the loan or line is secured directly affect the amount of credit extended and  in addition  changes in these values impact the depth of potential losses 
the vast majority of regions home equity lending balances was originated through its branch network 
during  home equity balances decreased billion to billion  driven by the continued general decline in demand and lower property valuations across the company s operating footprint 
during  credit quality within the home equity portfolio continued to reflect pressure 
charge offs during were elevated  but relatively stable as compared to the majority of the credit losses from this portfolio are related to loans where the collateral is a second lien located in florida 
a full discussion of these developments is included in the credit risk section later in this report 
indirect indirect lending  which is lending initiated through third party business partners  is largely comprised of loans made through automotive dealerships 
this portfolio class decreased million or percent in  reflecting the suspension of new originations within the indirect auto lending business and the suspension of the marine and recreational vehicle lending business 
beginning in late  the company re entered the indirect auto lending business 
other consumer other consumer loans include direct consumer installment loans  overdrafts and other revolving credit  and educational loans 
other consumer loans totaled billion at december   relatively unchanged from the prior year

at december   loans held for sale also totaled billion  consisting of million of residential real estate mortgage loans  million of student loans and million of non performing investor real estate loans 
the level of residential real estate mortgage and student loans held for sale fluctuates depending on the timing of origination and sale to third parties 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of credit losses inherent in both the loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments as of the balance sheet date 
the allowance consists of two components the allowance for loans losses  which is recorded as a contra asset to loans  and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments  which is recorded in other liabilities 
at december   the allowance for credit losses totaled billion or percent of loans  net of unearned income  compared to billion or percent at year end see allowance for credit losses in the credit risk section found later in this report for a detailed discussion of the allowance 

table of contents securities regions utilizes the securities portfolio to manage liquidity  interest rate risk  and regulatory capital  as well as to take advantage of market conditions to generate a favorable return on investments without undue risk 
the portfolio consists primarily of high quality mortgage backed and asset backed securities

as part of this process  in the first quarter of  regions sold approximately billion of residential agency securities available for sale and recognized a gain of approximately million 
the proceeds were reinvested into newer issue residential agency securities with slightly longer durations 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of  regions repositioned its agency mortgage backed securities portfolio in order to mitigate prepayment risk associated with that portfolio 
regions sold approximately billion of available for sale securities which primarily consisted of agency mortgage backed securities 
a gain of approximately million was recognized on the sale 
proceeds from the fourth quarter sales were reinvested in similar agency securities with lower coupons and longer durations 
regions continually analyzes relative value to the company across fixed income asset classes 
the current portfolio weighting to agency mortgage backed securities is not optimal over a longer horizon 
agency mortgage backed securities have an advantageous credit and liquidity profile  but also carry more prepayment risk than other types of securities 
regions expects to prudently balance these benefits and risks by expanding asset classes during and  as appropriate opportunities arise 
net unrealized gains and losses in the securities available for sale portfolio are included in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss  net of tax 
at december   securities available for sale included a net unrealized gain of million  which represented the difference between the estimated fair value of these securities as of year end and their amortized cost

portfolio quality regions investment policy emphasizes credit quality and liquidity 
securities rated in the highest category by nationally recognized rating agencies and securities backed by the us government and government sponsored agencies  both on a direct and indirect basis  represented approximately percent of the investment portfolio at december  all other securities rated below aaa  not backed by the us 
table of contents government or government sponsored agencies  or which are not rated represented less than one percent of total securities at year end during  due to the potential for downside price risk  the company substantially eliminated its exposure in non agency commercial mortgage backed securities  non agency residential mortgage backed securities and municipal bonds 
this was done in order to reduce credit risk within the portfolio 
regions increased its liquidity availability by reinvesting the proceeds in agency securities  including securities backed by gnma 
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks  interest bearing deposits in other banks including the federal reserve bank  and federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell which have a life of days or less 
at december   these assets totaled billion as compared to billion at december  the year over year decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in regions interest bearing deposits in other banks  primarily lower balances in its federal reserve bank account 
trading account assets trading account assets decreased billion to billion at december  the trading account assets are primarily held at morgan keegan 
also included in trading account assets are securities held in rabbi trusts related to deferred compensation plans

mortgage servicing rights are presented at fair value as of december  and on january   regions began accounting for mortgage servicing rights at fair market value with any changes to fair value being recorded within mortgage income 
also  in early  regions entered into derivative and trading asset transactions to mitigate the impact of market value fluctuations related to mortgage servicing rights 
however  derivative instruments entered into in the future could be materially different from the current risk profile of regions current portfolio 
see the mortgage income section earlier in this report for detail regarding the effect of mortgage servicing rights and related hedging items on regions consolidated statement of operations 
other identifiable intangible assets other identifiable intangible assets  consisting primarily of core deposit intangibles  totaled million at december  compared to million at december  the year over year decline is mainly the result of amortization 
regions noted no indicators of impairment for any other identifiable intangible assets 
see note intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
other assets other assets increased billion to billion as of december  securities sold but not yet settled near the end of primarily drove the increase 
net deferred income tax assets also contributed to the year over year increase  a portion of which resulted from sales of available for sale securities  which previously carried a deferred tax liability related to their unrealized gain 
the increases were partially offset by amortization of prepaid fdic premiums and reduced foreclosed properties balances 
deposits regions competes with other banking and financial services companies for a share of the deposit market 
regions ability to compete in the deposit market depends heavily on the pricing of its deposits and how effectively the company meets customers needs 
regions employs various means to meet those needs and enhance competitiveness  such as providing a high level of customer service  competitive pricing and providing convenient branch locations for its customers 
regions also serves customers through providing centralized  high quality banking services and alternative product delivery channels such as internet banking 
deposits are regions primary source of funds  providing funding for percent of average interest earning assets in and percent of average interest earning assets in table deposits details year over year deposits on a period ending basis 
total deposits as of year end decreased billion  or percent  compared to year end the overall decrease in deposits was primarily driven by decreases in customer time deposit accounts as a result of maturities 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in domestic money market accounts 
there has also been a shift from interest bearing transaction accounts to non interest bearing demand accounts during the year 
regions continues to deepen and retain existing customer relationships  as well as develop new relationships through client acquisition  new checking products and money market rate offers 
customer deposits  which are total deposits excluding deposits used for wholesale funding purposes  decreased by percent to billion on an ending basis during decreases in customer time deposit accounts were the main source of decline 
growth in domestic money market accounts offset the decline 
in  the banking industry experienced very high deposit pricing due to liquidity concerns thereby accentuating pricing pressure on regions and the industry as a whole

when the dodd frank act was enacted in july  it permanently increased the fdic coverage limit to  also as a result of the dodd frank act  effective as of december   unlimited coverage for non interest bearing demand transaction accounts will be provided until january  within customer deposits  non interest bearing deposits increased billion to billion  driven by an increase in non interest bearing deposits from commercial and small businesses and a mix shift from interest bearing transaction accounts which decreased percent to billion 
non interest bearing deposits accounted for approximately percent of total deposits at year end as compared to percent at year end savings balances increased million to billion  generally reflecting growing savings trends  spurred by economic uncertainty 
domestic money market products  which exclude foreign money market accounts  are one of regions most significant funding sources 
these balances increased percent in to billion or percent of total deposits  compared to percent of total deposits in and percent of total deposits in money market accounts steadily increased throughout also  foreign money market accounts decreased million  or percent  to million in included in customer time deposits are certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts 
the balance of customer time deposits decreased percent in to billion compared to billion in the decrease was primarily due to maturities with minimal reinvestment by customers as a result of a decline in rates offered on these products 
customer time deposits accounted for percent of total deposits in compared to percent in consistent with  total treasury deposits  which are used mainly for overnight funding purposes  remained at low levels in as the company continued to utilize customer based funding and other sources 
the company s choice of overnight funding sources is dependent on the company s particular funding needs and the relative attractiveness of each source 

table of contents the sensitivity of regions deposit rates to changes in market interest rates is reflected in regions average interest rate paid on interest bearing deposits 
the rate paid on interest bearing deposits decreased to percent in from percent in  driven by the expiration of time deposits  the positive mix shift to lower customer products  and continuation of the low interest rate environment throughout table maturity of time deposits of  or more presents maturities of time deposits of  or more at december  and table maturity of time deposits of  or more in millions time deposits of  or more  maturing in months or less over through months over through months over months short term borrowings see note short term borrowings to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of these borrowings at december  and company funding sources federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase used for funding purposes totaled million at december   compared to million at year end the level of federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase can fluctuate significantly on a day to day basis  depending on funding requirements and which sources of funds are used to satisfy those needs 
all such arrangements are considered typical of the banking and brokerage industries and are accounted for as borrowings 
as another source of funding  the company utilized short term borrowings through the issuance of fhlb advances 
fhlb borrowings are used to satisfy short term and long term borrowing needs and can also fluctuate between periods 
short term fhlb borrowings totaled million at december  compared to billion at december  the company continues to utilize fhlb borrowings as a means to reduce overnight funding and diversify into slightly longer term maturities at preferable rates

table of contents long term borrowings regions long term borrowings consist primarily of fhlb borrowings  subordinated notes  senior notes and other long term notes payable 
total long term borrowings decreased billion to billion at december  see note long term borrowings to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion and detailed listing of outstandings and rates 
membership in the fhlb system provides access to a source of lower cost funds 
as of december   regions had total long term fhlb advances of billion  compared to billion at december  during  regions prepaid approximately billion of fhlb advances  realizing million in pre tax losses on early extinguishment 
these extinguishments were part of the company s asset liability management process 
the remaining decrease between years was due to maturities 
long term fhlb structured advances have stated maturities during  but are convertible quarterly at the option of the fhlb 
the convertible feature provides that after a specified date in the future  the advances will remain at a fixed rate  or regions will have the option to either pay off the advance or convert from a fixed rate to a variable rate based on the libor index 
the fhlb structured advances had a weighted average interest rate of at december  and at december  other fhlb advances at december   and had a weighted average interest rate of  and  respectively  with maturities of one to nineteen years 
fhlb borrowings are contingent upon the amount of collateral pledged to the fhlb 
regions has pledged certain residential first mortgage loans on one to four family dwellings and home equity lines of credit as collateral for the fhlb advances outstanding 
see note loans to the consolidated financial statements for loans pledged to the fhlb at december  and additionally  membership in the fhlb requires an institution to hold fhlb stock  and regions held million at december  and million at december  regions borrowing availability with the fhlb as of december   based on assets available for collateral at that date  was billion 
as of december   regions had outstanding subordinated notes totaling billion  essentially unchanged from december  regions subordinated notes consist of ten issues with interest rates ranging from to 
all issuances of these notes are  by definition  subordinated and subject in right of payment of both principal and interest to the prior payment in full of all senior indebtedness of the company  which is generally defined as all indebtedness and other obligations of the company to its creditors  except subordinated indebtedness 
payment of the principal of the notes may be accelerated only in the case of certain events involving bankruptcy  insolvency proceedings or reorganization of the company 
the subordinated notes described above qualify as tier capital under federal reserve guidelines 
none of the subordinated notes are redeemable prior to maturity 
in october  the fdic announced a new program the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks  thrifts and certain holding companies  and by providing full coverage of non interest bearing deposit transaction accounts  regardless of dollar amount 
under the original rules  certain newly issued senior unsecured debt with maturities greater than days issued on or before june   would be backed by the full faith and credit of the us government through june  the fdic s payment obligation under the guarantee for eligible senior unsecured debt would be triggered by a payment default 
the guarantee is limited to percent of senior unsecured debt as of september  that was scheduled to mature before june  this includes federal funds purchased  promissory notes  commercial paper and certain types of inter bank funding 
participants were charged a basis point fee to protect their new debt issues which varies depending on the maturity date 
additionally  participants could elect to pay a fee of basis points on their tlgp capacity for the right to issue non guaranteed debt during the program 
this fee was non refundable and used to offset the guarantee fee for issuances until exhausted 
in december  regions bank completed an offering of billion of qualifying senior bank notes covered by the tlgp 
payment of principal and interest on the notes will be guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the united states pursuant to the tlgp 
at december   approximately billion of this offering remained outstanding and will mature in december 
table of contents as of december   regions had senior debt and bank notes totaling billion  compared to billion at december  in june and december  approximately million and billion of senior notes  respectively  matured

in february  regions filed a shelf registration statement with the us securities and exchange commission 
this shelf registration does not have a capacity limit and can be utilized by regions to issue various debt and or equity securities 
the registration statement will expire in february regions bank note program allows regions bank to issue up to billion aggregate principal amount of bank notes outstanding at any one time 
no issuances have been made under this program as of december  notes issued under the program may be senior notes with maturities from days to years and subordinated notes with maturities from years to years 
these notes are not deposits and they are not insured or guaranteed by the fdic 
regions borrowing availability with the federal reserve bank discount window as of december   based on assets available for collateral at that date  was billion 
regions may  from time to time  consider opportunistically retiring its outstanding issued securities  including subordinated debt  trust preferred securities and preferred shares in privately negotiated or open market transactions for cash or common shares 
ratings during  regions experienced rating actions by standard poor s corporation s p  moody s investors service  fitch ratings and dominion bond rating service dbrs 
the agencies downgraded obligations of regions financial corporation and regions bank 
in general  ratings agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors  including capital adequacy  liquidity  asset quality  business mix  probability of government support  and level and quality of earnings 
any downgrade in credit ratings by one or more ratings agencies may impact regions in several ways  including  but not limited to  regions access to the capital markets or short term funding  borrowing cost and capacity  collateral requirements  acceptability of its letters of credit  funding of variable rate demand notes vrdns  as well as fdic insurance costs  thereby potentially adversely impacting regions financial condition and liquidity

the rationale for the downgrades reflects moody s view that the likelihood of government support for these institutions is lower now that the us banking system has moved beyond the financial crisis 
shortly following the downgrade by moody s  regions financial corporation and regions bank received downgrades from each of the other ratings agencies  citing concerns regarding regions credit quality  specifically commercial real estate loan exposures and unfavorable geographic concentrations  and the related implications for its capital  as the primary determinants of the ratings actions 
at december   moody s and s p s credit ratings for regions were below investment grade 
for regions bank  moody s credit ratings were below investment grade 
regions and regions bank remain on a credit watch with negative implications from moody s

table of contents stockholders equity stockholders equity decreased to billion at year end versus billion at year end in  net losses reduced stockholders equity by million  cash dividends declared reduced stockholders equity by million for common stock and million for preferred stock  and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income decreased equity by million 
on may   the final results of the federal reserve s supervisory capital assessment program scap were released requiring regions to submit a capital plan to its regulators detailing the steps to be utilized to increase total tier common equity by billion  of which at least billion had to be new tier equity see table gaap to non gaap reconciliation and table capital ratios for further discussion 
the company s public equity offering of common stock  announced may   resulted in the issuance of million shares at per share  generating proceeds of approximately billion  net of issuance costs 
the company also issued  shares of mandatory convertible preferred stock  series b series b shares  generating net proceeds of approximately million 
accrued dividends on the series b shares reduced retained earnings by million and million during and  respectively 
in november  a single investor converted approximately  series b shares to common shares as allowed under the original transaction documents 
on june   as allowed by the terms of the series b shares  regions initiated an early conversion of all of the remaining outstanding series b shares 
dividends accrued and unpaid at the conversion date were settled through issuance of common shares in accordance with the original document 
no series b shares were outstanding at december  approximately million common shares were issued in the conversion and dividend settlement 
in addition to the offerings mentioned above  in the company also exchanged approximately million common shares for million of outstanding percent trust preferred securities issued by regions financing trust ii the trust 
the trust preferred securities were exchanged for junior subordinated notes issued by the company to the trust 
the company recognized a pre tax gain of approximately million on the extinguishment of the junior subordinated notes 
the increase in shareholders equity related to the debt for common share exchange was approximately million  net of issuance costs 
these public offerings along with other capital raising efforts resulted in regions fully meeting the tier common equity capital and exceeding the tier capital requirements prescribed by the scap see table gaap to non gaap reconciliation for further discussion 
at december   regions had million common shares available for repurchase through open market transactions under an existing share repurchase authorization 
there were no treasury stock purchases through open market transactions during or the company s ability to repurchase its common stock is limited by the terms of the purchase agreement between regions and the us treasury entered into on november   pursuant to the us treasury s capital purchase program cpp

the decrease between years was a result of the change in accumulated other comprehensive income and the reduction in tangible assets 
in  regions decreased its annual dividend to per common share  compared to in and in regions does not expect to increase its quarterly dividend above per common share for the foreseeable future 

table of contents bank regulatory capital requirements regions and regions bank are required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by banking regulatory agencies 
currently  there are two basic measures of capital adequacy a risk based measure and a leverage measure 
the risk based capital standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in credit and market risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies  to account for off balance sheet exposure and interest rate risk  and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets 
assets and off balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories  each with specified risk weighting factors 
the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
banking organizations that are considered to have excessive interest rate risk exposure are required to maintain higher levels of capital 
the minimum standard for the ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is percent 
at least percent of that capital level must consist of common equity  undivided profits and non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  senior perpetual preferred stock issued to the us treasury under the cpp  minority interests relating to qualifying common or noncumulative perpetual preferred stock issued by a consolidated us depository institution or foreign bank subsidiary  less goodwill and certain other intangibles tier capital 
the remainder tier capital may consist of a limited amount of other preferred stock  mandatorily convertible securities  subordinated debt  and a limited amount of the allowance for loan losses 
the sum of tier capital and tier capital is total risk based capital or total capital 
however  under the collins amendment  which was passed as a section of the dodd frank act  trust preferred securities will be eliminated as an element of tier capital 
this disallowance of trust preferred securities will be phased in from january  to january  debt or equity instruments issued to the federal government as part of the cpp are exempt from the collins amendment 
as of december   regions has million of trust preferred securities that are subject to the collins amendment and billion of preferred equity that is exempt from the collins amendment 
the banking regulatory agencies also have adopted regulations that supplement the risk based guidelines to include a minimum ratio of percent of tier capital to average assets less goodwill and disallowed deferred tax assets the leverage ratio 
depending upon the risk profile of the institution and other factors  the regulatory agencies may require a leverage ratio of percent to percent above the minimum percent level 
in connection with the scap  banking regulators began supplementing their assessment of the capital adequacy of a bank based on a variation of tier capital  known as tier common equity 
while not codified  analysts and banking regulators have assessed regions capital adequacy using the tangible common stockholders equity and or the tier common equity measure 
because tangible common stockholders equity and tier common equity are not formally defined by gaap or codified in the federal banking regulations  these measures are considered to be non gaap financial measures and other entities may calculate them differently than regions disclosed calculations see table gaap to non gaap reconciliation for further details 
regions tier common and tier capital ratios were percent and percent as of december  regions is evaluating the anticipated impact of basel iii  which will begin in and is expected to be fully phased in on january  
the company s pro forma tier common and tier capital ratios  based on regions current understanding of the guidelines  are approximately and percent  above the basel iii minimums of percent for tier common and percent for tier capital 
regions also expects to meet the basel iii liquidity coverage ratio in its current form 
however  there is still need for clarification of the basel iii rules as well as interpretation and implementation by us banking regulators  so the ultimate impact on regions is not completely known at this point

regions owns the common stock of subsidiary business trusts  which have issued mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities trust preferred securities in the aggregate of billion at the time of issuance 
these trusts meet the definition of a variable interest entity of which regions is not the primary beneficiary  the trusts only assets are junior subordinated debentures issued by regions  which were acquired by the trusts using the proceeds from the issuance of the trust preferred securities and common stock 
the junior subordinated debentures are included in long term borrowings see note long term borrowings 
table of contents to the consolidated financial statements and regions equity interests in the business trusts are included in other assets 
for regulatory reporting and capital adequacy purposes  the federal reserve board has indicated that such trust preferred securities will continue to constitute tier capital 
additional discussion regarding the status of capital treatment for these instruments is included in the supervision and regulation capital requirements section of item of this annual report on form k 
also  regions periodically invests in various limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects  which are funded through a combination of debt and equity 
regions maximum exposure to loss as of december  was million  which included million in unfunded commitments to the partnerships 
additionally  regions has short term construction loans or letters of credit commitments with the partnerships totaling million as of december  the funded portion of these loans and letters of credit was million at december  the funded portion is included with loans on the consolidated balance sheets

effects of inflation the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature  therefore  a financial institution differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies  which have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories that are greatly impacted by inflation 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation also affects other expenses that tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
management believes the most significant potential impact of inflation on financial results is a direct result of regions ability to manage the impact of changes in interest rates 
management attempts to maintain an essentially balanced position between rate sensitive assets and liabilities in order to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income 
however  this goal can be difficult to completely achieve in times of rapidly changing rate structure and is one of many factors considered in determining the company s interest rate positioning 
the company is asset sensitive as of december  refer to table interest rate sensitivity for additional details on regions interest rate sensitivity 
effects of deflation a period of deflation would affect all industries  including financial institutions 
potentially  deflation could lead to lower profits  higher unemployment  lower production and deterioration in overall economic conditions 
in addition  deflation could depress economic activity and impair bank earnings through increasing the value of debt while decreasing the value of collateral for loans 
if the economy experienced a severe period of deflation  then it could depress loan demand  impair the ability of borrowers to repay loans and sharply reduce bank earnings 
management believes the most significant potential impact of deflation on financial results is a direct result of regions ability to maintain a high amount of capital to cushion against future losses 
in addition  the company can utilize certain risk management tools to help the bank maintain its balance sheet strength even if a deflationary scenario were to develop 
risk management risk identification and risk management are key elements in the overall management of regions 
management believes the primary risk exposures are market risk  liquidity risk  counterparty risk and credit risk 
market risk is the price and earnings variability mainly reductions arising from adverse changes in the fair values of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices 
table of contents or the credit quality of debt securities and or the impact to net interest income based on changes in interest rates and the associated impact on prepayments 
regions market risk is made up of three components interest rate risk  prepayment risk  and capital markets and brokerage related risks primarily associated with morgan keegan 
interest rate risk is the risk to net interest income due to the impact of movements in interest rates 
prepayment risk is the risk that borrowers may repay their loans or other debt earlier than at their stated maturities 
the company  primarily through morgan keegan  is also subject to various market related risks associated with its brokerage and market related activities 
liquidity risk relates to regions ability to fund present and future obligations 
counterparty risk represents the risk that a counterparty will not comply with its contractual obligations 
credit risk represents the risk that parties indebted to regions fail to perform as contractually obligated 
regions primary credit risk arises from the possibility that borrowers may not be able to repay loans  and to a lesser extent  the failure of securities issuers and counterparties to perform as contractually required 
management follows a formal policy to evaluate and document the key risks facing each line of business  how those risks can be controlled or mitigated  and how management monitors the controls to ensure that they are effective 
separate from risk acceptance  there is an independent risk assessment and reporting program 
to ensure that risks within the company are presented and appropriately addressed  the board has designated a risk committee of outside directors 
the risk committee s focus is on regions overall risk profile and the committee receives reports from the company quarterly 
additionally  regions internal audit division performs ongoing  independent reviews of the risk management process which are reported to the audit committee of the board of directors 
some of the more significant processes used to manage and control these and other risks are described in the remainder of this report 
external factors beyond management s control may result in losses despite risk management efforts 
market risk interest rate risk regions primary market risk is interest rate risk  including uncertainty with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as uncertainty with respect to relative interest rate levels  which is impacted by both the shape and the slope of the various yield curves that affect the financial products and services that the company offers 
to quantify this risk  regions measures the change in its net interest income in various interest rate scenarios compared to a base case scenario 
net interest income sensitivity is a useful short term indicator of regions interest rate risk 
sensitivity measurement financial simulation models are regions primary tools used to measure interest rate exposure 
using a wide range of sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates 
models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of regions balance sheet 
assumptions are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates  the slope of the yield curve  and the changing composition of the balance sheet that result from both strategic plans and from customer behavior 
among the assumptions are expectations of balance sheet growth and composition  the pricing and maturity characteristics of existing business and the characteristics of future business 
interest rate related risks are expressly considered  such as pricing spreads  the lag time in pricing deposit accounts  prepayments and other option risks 
regions considers these factors  as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty surrounding their future behavior 
historically  regions balance sheet has consisted of a relatively rate sensitive deposit base that funds a predominantly floating rate commercial and consumer loan portfolio 
this mix of regions core business activities creates a naturally asset sensitive balance sheet  meaning that increases decreases in interest rates would likely have a positive negative cumulative impact on regions net interest income 
to manage the balance sheet s interest rate risk  regions maintains a portfolio of largely fixed rate discretionary investments  loans and derivatives 
the market risk of these discretionary instruments attributable to variation in interest rates is fully incorporated into the simulation results in the same manner as all other balance sheet instruments 

table of contents the primary objective of asset liability management at regions is to coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to sustain a reasonable and stable net interest income throughout various interest rate cycles 
in computing interest rate sensitivity for measurement  regions compares a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario based on market forward rates 
the standard set of interest rate scenarios includes the traditional instantaneous parallel rate shifts of plus and basis points 
regions also prepares a minus basis points scenario  a minus basis point scenario is not considered realistic in the current rate environment 
up rate scenarios of greater magnitude are also analyzed  and are of increased importance as the current and historic low levels of interest rates increase the relative likelihood of a rapid and substantial increase in interest rates 
regions also includes simulations of gradual interest rate movements that may more realistically mimic potential interest rate movements 
these gradual scenarios include curve steepening  flattening  and parallel movements of various magnitudes phased in over a six month period  and include rate shifts of plus and minus basis points and plus basis points 
exposure to interest rate movements as of december   regions was moderately asset sensitive to both gradual and instantaneous rate shifts as compared to the base case for the measurement horizon ending in december regions continues to observe that the pace of economic recovery is at risk of being slow  which may result in a continuation of this period of low interest rates 
to partially offset the adverse impact on net interest income and net interest margin attributable to an extended period of low interest rates  regions entered into a series of receive fixed interest rate swaps 
these instruments have a final maturity in december the table below summarizes regions position  and the scenarios are inclusive of all interest rate risk hedging activities 
note that where scenarios would indicate negative interest rates  a minimum of zero is applied 
table interest rate sensitivity gradual change in interest rates estimated annual change in net interest income december  in millions basis points basis points basis points instantaneous change in interest rates basis points basis points basis points interest rate movements may also have an impact on the value of regions securities portfolio  which can directly impact the carrying value of shareholders equity 
regions from time to time may hedge these price movements with derivatives as discussed below 
however  at december   regions had no designations of hedges to mitigate price movements of securities 
derivatives regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of interest rate sensitivity 
the asset and liability committee alco  which consists of members of regions senior management team  in its oversight role for the management of interest rate sensitivity  approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging strategies 
the most common derivatives regions employs are forward rate contracts  eurodollar futures contracts  interest rate swaps  options on interest rate swaps  interest rate caps and floors  and forward sale commitments 
derivatives are also used to offset the risks associated with customer derivatives  which include interest rate  credit and foreign exchange risks 
forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at a future date at a specified price or yield 
a eurodollar futures contract is a future on a eurodollar deposit 
eurodollar futures contracts 
table of contents subject regions to market risk associated with changes in interest rates 
because futures contracts are cash settled daily  there is minimal credit risk associated with eurodollar futures 
interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically entered into to exchange fixed for variable or vice versa streams of interest payments 
the notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a reference for the size of interest settlements 
interest rate options are contracts that allow the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a predetermined price and time 
forward sale commitments are contractual obligations to sell market instruments at a future date for an already agreed upon price 
foreign currency contracts involve the exchange of one currency for another on a specified date and at a specified rate 
these contracts are executed on behalf of the company s customers and are used to manage fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
the company is subject to the credit risk that another party will fail to perform 
regions has made use of interest rate swaps to effectively convert a portion of its fixed rate funding position to a variable rate position and  in some cases  to effectively convert a portion of its variable rate loan portfolio to fixed rate 
regions also uses derivatives to manage interest rate and pricing risk associated with its mortgage origination business 
in the period of time that elapses between the origination and sale of mortgage loans  changes in interest rates have the potential to cause a decline in the value of the loans in this held for sale portfolio 
futures contracts and forward sale commitments are used to protect the value of the loan pipeline and loans held for sale from changes in interest rates and pricing 
regions manages the credit risk of these instruments in much the same way as it manages credit risk of the loan portfolios by establishing credit limits for each counterparty and through collateral agreements for dealer transactions 
for non dealer transactions  the need for collateral is evaluated on an individual transaction basis and is primarily dependent on the financial strength of the counterparty 
credit risk is also reduced significantly by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements 
when there is more than one transaction with a counterparty and there is a legally enforceable master netting agreement in place  the exposure represents the net of the gain and loss positions with and collateral received from and or posted to that counterparty 
the credit risk section in this report contains more information on the management of credit risk 
regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers 
interest rate swaps  interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most common derivatives sold to customers 
other derivatives instruments with similar characteristics are used to hedge market risk and minimize volatility associated with this portfolio 
instruments used to service customers are held in the trading account  with changes in value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
the primary objective of regions hedging strategies is to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes  from an economic perspective  on net interest income and the net present value of its balance sheet 
the overall effectiveness of these hedging strategies is subject to market conditions  the quality of regions execution  the accuracy of its valuation assumptions  counterparty credit risk and changes in interest rates 
as a result  regions hedging strategies may be ineffective in mitigating the impact of interest rate changes on its earnings 
see note derivative financial instruments and hedging activities to the consolidated financial statements for a tabular summary of regions year end derivatives positions and further discussion 
on january   regions began accounting for mortgage servicing rights at fair market value with any changes to fair value being recorded within mortgage income 
also  in early  regions entered into derivative and balance sheet transactions to mitigate the impact of market value fluctuations related to mortgage servicing rights 
derivative instruments entered in the future could be materially different from the current risk profile of regions current portfolio 
market risk prepayment risk regions  like most financial institutions  is subject to changing prepayment speeds on mortgage related assets under different interest rate environments 
prepayment risk is a significant risk to earnings and specifically to net interest income 
for example  mortgage loans and other financial assets may be prepaid by a debtor  so that 
table of contents the debtor may refinance its obligations at lower rates 
as loans and other financial assets prepay in a falling rate environment  regions must reinvest these funds in lower yielding assets 
prepayments of assets carrying higher rates reduce regions interest income and overall asset yields 
conversely  in a rising rate environment  these assets will prepay at a slower rate  resulting in opportunity cost by not having the cash flow to reinvest at higher rates 
prepayment risk can also impact the value of securities and the carrying value of equity 
regions greatest exposures to prepayment risks primarily rest in its mortgage backed securities portfolio  the mortgage fixed rate loan portfolio and the mortgage servicing asset  all of which tend to be sensitive to interest rate movements 
prepayments on mortgage backed securities increased during due to the favorable mortgage interest rate environment that existed for the majority of the year 
however  tighter lending standards  decreased home prices  and lingering uncertainty surrounding the economic environment restrained otherwise higher prepayment speeds 
regions also has prepayment risk that would be reflected in non interest income in the form of servicing income on loans sold 
regions actively monitors prepayment exposure as part of its overall net interest income forecasting and interest rate risk management 
in particular  because interest rates are currently relatively low  regions is actively managing exposure to declining prepayments that are expected to coincide with increasing interest rates in both the loan and securities portfolios 
market risk brokerage and other market activity risk references below  and elsewhere in this form k  to morgan keegan are intended to include not only morgan keegan company  inc but also certain of its affiliates and subsidiaries 
it should not be assumed or infered that any specific activity mentioned is carried on by any particular morgan keegan entity 
morgan keegan s business activities  including its securities inventory positions and securities held for investment  expose it to market risk 
further  the company is also exposed to market risk in its capital markets business  which includes derivatives  loan syndication and foreign exchange trading activities  and mortgage trading activity  which includes secondary marketing of loans to government sponsored entities 
morgan keegan trades for its own account in corporate and tax exempt securities and us government agency and government sponsored securities 
most of these transactions are entered into to facilitate the execution of customers orders to buy or sell these securities 
in addition  it trades certain equity securities in order to make a market in these securities 
morgan keegan s trading activities require the commitment of capital 
all principal transactions place the subsidiary s capital at risk 
profits and losses are dependent upon the skills of employees and market fluctuations 
in order to mitigate the risks of carrying inventory and as part of other normal brokerage activities  morgan keegan assumes short positions on securities 
in the normal course of business  morgan keegan enters into underwriting and forward and future commitments 
at december   the notional amount of forward commitments was approximately million 
morgan keegan typically settles its position by entering into equal but opposite contracts and  as such  the contract amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
settlement of the transactions relating to such commitments is not expected to have a material effect on regions consolidated financial position 
transactions involving future settlement give rise to market risk  which represents the potential gain or loss that can be caused by a change in the market value of a particular financial instrument 
regions exposure to market risk is determined by a number of factors  including the size  composition and diversification of positions held  the absolute and relative levels of interest rates  and market volatility 
additionally  in the normal course of business  morgan keegan enters into transactions for delayed delivery  to be announced securities  which are recorded in trading account assets on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
risks arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts and from unfavorable changes in interest rates or the market values of the securities underlying the instruments 
the credit risk associated with these contracts is typically limited to the cost of replacing all contracts on which morgan keegan has recorded an unrealized gain 
for exchange traded contracts  the clearing organization acts as the counterparty to specific transactions and  therefore  bears the risk of delivery to and from counterparties 

table of contents interest rate risk at morgan keegan arises from the exposure of holding interest sensitive financial instruments such as government  corporate and municipal bonds  and certain preferred equities 
morgan keegan manages its exposure to interest rate risk by setting and monitoring limits and  where feasible  entering into offsetting positions in securities with similar interest rate risk characteristics 
securities inventories recorded in trading account assets on the consolidated balance sheets  are marked to market  and  accordingly  there are no unrecorded gains or losses in value 
while a significant portion of the securities inventories have contractual maturities in excess of five years  these inventories  on average  turn over in excess of twelve times per year 
accordingly  the exposure to interest rate risk inherent in morgan keegan s securities inventories is less than that of similar financial instruments held by firms in other industries 
morgan keegan s equity securities inventories are exposed to risk of loss in the event of unfavorable price movements 
also  morgan keegan is subject to credit risk arising from non performance by trading counterparties  customers and issuers of debt securities owned 
this risk is managed by imposing and monitoring position limits  monitoring trading counterparties  reviewing security concentrations  holding and marking to market collateral  and conducting business through clearing organizations that guarantee performance 
morgan keegan regularly participates in the trading of some derivative securities for its customers  however  this activity does not involve morgan keegan acquiring a significant position or commitment in these products and this trading is not a significant portion of morgan keegan s business 
morgan keegan has been an underwriter and dealer in auction rate securities 
see note commitments  contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements for more details regarding regulatory action related to morgan keegan auction rate securities 
as of december   customers of morgan keegan owned approximately million of auction rate securities  and morgan keegan held approximately million of auction rate securities on the balance sheet 
to manage trading risks arising from interest rate and equity price risks  regions uses a value at risk var model along with other risk management methods to measure the potential fair value the company could lose on its trading positions given a specified statistical confidence level and time to liquidate time horizon 
the end of period var was approximately thousand at december  and million at december  maximum daily var utilization during was million and average daily var during the same period was million 
liquidity risk liquidity is an important factor in the financial condition of regions and affects regions ability to meet the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of its customers 
table contractual obligations summarizes regions contractual cash obligations at december  regions intends to fund obligations primarily through cash generated from normal operations 
in addition to these obligations  regions has obligations related to potential litigation contingencies see note commitments  contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the company s funding requirements 
assets  consisting principally of loans and securities  are funded by customer deposits  purchased funds  borrowed funds and stockholders equity 
regions goal in liquidity management is to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  while at the same time meeting its cash flow needs 
the challenges of the current market environment demonstrate the importance of having and using diversified sources of liquidity to satisfy the company s funding requirements 
in order to ensure an appropriate level of liquidity is maintained  regions performs specific procedures including scenario analyses and stress testing at the bank  holding company and affiliate levels 
regions policy is to maintain a sufficient level of funding to meet projected cash needs  including all debt service  dividends  and maturities  for the subsequent two years at the parent company and acceptable periods for the bank and other affiliates 
the company s funding and contingency planning does not currently include any reliance on 
table of contents unsecured sources 
however  regions has continued to test those markets and has entered them only when opportunistic borrowing is available 
regions has chosen to focus on using short term secured sources of funding

see note income taxes to the consoliated financial statements 
see note commitments  contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements for the company s commercial commitments at december  the securities portfolio is one of regions primary sources of liquidity 
maturities of securities provide a constant flow of funds available for cash needs see table relative contractual maturities and weighted average yields for securities 
the agency guaranteed mortgage portfolio is another source of liquidity in various secured borrowing capacities 
in anticipation of regulatory changes proposed within the basel iii framework  in particular the liquidity coverage ratio  regions increased its holdings in securities backed by gnma  which are explicitly backed by the us government 
maturities in the loan portfolio also provide a steady flow of funds see table selected loan maturities 
at december   commercial loans and investor real estate mortgage and construction loans with an aggregate balance of billion were due to mature in one year or less  although regions may renew some of these lending arrangements if the risk profile is acceptable 
additionally  securities of million were due to mature in one year or less 
additional funds are provided from payments on consumer loans and one to four family residential first mortgage loans 
in addition  liquidity needs can also be met by borrowing funds in state and national money markets 
historically  regions liquidity has been enhanced by a stable customer deposit base 
during and  regions customer base grew substantially in response to competitive offers and customers desire to lock in rates in the falling rate environment  as well as the introduction of new consumer and business checking products 

table of contents regions elected to exit the fdic tag program on july  the tag program is a component of the temporary liquidity guarantee program  whereby the fdic guarantees all funds held at participating institutions beyond the  deposit insurance limit in qualifying transaction accounts 
the decision to exit the program did not have a significant impact on liquidity 
the dodd frank act permanently increased the fdic coverage limit to  as a result of the dodd frank act  effective december   unlimited coverage for non interest bearing demand transaction accounts will be provided through january  as of december   regions had billion of fdic uninsured deposits 
due to the potential for uncertainty and inconsistency in the unsecured funding markets  regions has been maintaining higher levels of cash liquidity by depositing excess cash with the federal reserve bank  which primarily comprises the balance sheet line item  interest bearing deposits in other banks 
at the end of  regions had over billion in excess cash on deposit with the federal reserve 
regions borrowing availability with the federal reserve bank as of december   based on assets available for collateral at that date  was billion 
regions periodically accesses funding markets through sales of securities with agreements to repurchase 
repurchase agreements are also offered through a commercial banking sweep product as a short term investment opportunity for customers 
all such arrangements are considered typical of the banking and brokerage industries and are accounted for as borrowings 
regions financing arrangement with the fhlb adds additional flexibility in managing its liquidity position 
as of december   fhlb atlanta advances totaled billion 
fhlb borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral pledged to the fhlb 
regions has additional collateral available and  accordingly  has additional capacity to borrow from the fhlb 
regions bank and its subsidiaries have pledged certain residential first mortgage loans on one to four family dwellings and home equity lines of credit as collateral for the fhlb advances outstanding 
additionally  investment in fhlb stock is required in relation to the level of outstanding borrowings 
regions held million in fhlb stock at december  the fhlb has been and is expected to continue to be a reliable and economical source of funding 
in february  regions filed a shelf registration statement with the us securities and exchange commission 
this shelf registration does not have a capacity limit and can be utilized by regions to issue various debt and equity securities 
the registration statement will expire in february during the second quarter of  regions issued from the shelf million par value of senior notes due april and million par value of senior notes due june regions bank note program allows regions bank to issue up to billion aggregate principal amount of bank notes outstanding at any one time 
no issuances have been made under this program as of december  notes issued under the program may be senior notes with maturities from days to years and subordinated notes with maturities from years to years 
these notes are not deposits and they are not insured or guaranteed by the fdic 
regions may  from time to time  consider opportunistically retiring outstanding issued securities  including subordinated debt  trust preferred securities and preferred shares in privately negotiated or open market transactions for cash or common shares

table of contents counterparty risk regions manages and monitors its exposure to other financial institutions  also known as counterparty exposure  on an ongoing basis 
the objective is to ensure that regions appropriately identifies and reacts to risks associated with counterparties in a timely manner 
this exposure may be direct or indirect exposure that could create legal  reputational or financial risk to the company 
counterparty exposure may result from a variety of transaction types and may include exposure to commercial banks  savings and loans  insurance companies  broker dealers  institutions that provide credit enhancements  and corporate debt issuers 
because transactions with a counterparty may be generated in one or more departments  credit limits are established for use by various areas of the company including treasury  capital markets  finance  the mortgage division and lines of business 
to manage counterparty risk  regions has a centralized approach to approval  management and monitoring of exposure 
to that end  regions has a dedicated counterparty credit group and credit officer  as well as a documented counterparty credit policy 
exposures to counterparties are regularly aggregated across departments and reported to senior management 
regions has various counterparties that are regularly relied upon for market making capabilities  primarily broker dealers 
with these counterparties  regions typically has in place margin agreements that are monitored daily  with margin posted to collateralize exposure as appropriate 
interaction with these counterparties is part of the risk management and monitoring process outlined above 
credit risk regions objective regarding credit risk is to maintain a high quality credit portfolio that provides for stable credit costs with acceptable volatility through an economic cycle 
management process regions employs a credit risk management process with defined policies  accountability and regular reporting to manage credit risk in the loan portfolio 
credit risk management is guided by credit policies that provide for a consistent and prudent approach to underwriting and approvals of credits 
within the credit policy department  procedures exist that elevate the approval requirements as credits become larger and more complex 
generally  consumer credits and smaller commercial credits are centrally underwritten based on custom credit matrices and policies that are modified as appropriate 
larger commercial and commercial real estate transactions are individually underwritten  risk rated  approved and monitored 
responsibility and accountability for adherence to underwriting policies and accurate risk ratings lies in the lines of business 
for consumer and small business portfolios  the risk management process focuses on managing customers who become delinquent in their payments and managing performance of the credit scorecards  which are periodically adjusted based on actual credit performance 
commercial business units are responsible for underwriting new business and  on an ongoing basis  monitoring the credit of their portfolios  including a complete review of the borrower semi annually or more frequently as needed 
to ensure problem commercial credits are identified on a timely basis  several specific portfolio reviews occur each quarter to assess the larger adversely rated credits for accrual status and  if necessary  to ensure such individual credits are transferred to regions special assets division  which specializes in managing distressed credit exposures 
there are also separate and independent commercial credit and consumer credit risk management organizational groups 
these organizational units partner with the business line to assist in the processes 
table of contents described above  including the review and approval of new business and ongoing assessments of existing loans in the portfolio 
independent commercial and consumer credit risk management provides for more accurate risk ratings and the timely identification of problem credits  as well as oversight for the chief credit officer on conditions and trends in the credit portfolios 
credit quality and trends in the loan portfolio are measured and monitored regularly and detailed reports  by product  business unit and geography  are reviewed by line of business personnel and the chief credit officer 
the chief credit officer reviews summaries of these credit reports with executive management and the board of directors 
finally  the credit review department provides ongoing independent oversight of the credit portfolios to ensure policies are followed  credits are properly risk rated and that key credit control processes are functioning as intended 
risk characteristics of the loan portfolio in order to assess the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio  regions considers the current us economic environment and that of its primary banking markets  as well as risk factors within the major categories of loans 
economic environment in regions banking markets the largest factor influencing the credit performance of regions loan portfolio is the overall economic environment in the us and the primary markets in which it operates 
the great recession that began in december continued through and into through this recessionary period  the overall output of goods and services experienced its sharpest decline since the early s 
consumer spending  about percent of all recorded spending  has been adversely impacted by declining inflation adjusted income  low additional credit capacity  historically high required monthly debt payments  a negative employment outlook  a higher savings portion of after tax personal income  and historically low consumer confidence 
however  business sector output continues to grow  driven by replenishment of inventories that were highly depleted during the recession 
in  the economic downturn that began with the housing slowdown continued to negatively impact consumer confidence 
in turn  lower confidence levels negatively affected demand for goods and services 
this lower demand impacted retail sales and led to increased vacancy rates and lower rent rolls for the commercial real estate sector 
high unemployment continued in but began improving in residential real estate prices were stable in  however  concerns remain about the impact on real estate prices from the future sale of the large supply of homes that are either on bank balance sheets or currently delinquent 
in the fourth quarter of  significant fiscal and monetary stimuli were implemented 
on december   the president approved significant tax provisions that are expected to increase consumption  and  thereby  gross domestic product  in and on november   the federal reserve approved the purchase of an additional billion in us treasury bonds 
the combination of these two policy actions should support growth and dramatically lower the possibility of a second recession in these actions should also help mitigate further downside risk for asset prices  in particular real estate prices 
portfolio characteristics regions has a diversified loan portfolio  in terms of product type  collateral and geography 
at december   commercial loans represented percent of total loans  net of unearned income  investor real estate loans represented percent  residential first mortgage loans totaled percent and other consumer loans  largely home equity lending  comprised the remaining percent 
following is a discussion of risk characteristics of each loan type 
commercial the commercial loan portfolio segment totaled billion at year end and primarily consists of loans to small and mid sized commercial and large corporate customers with business operations in regions geographic footprint 
loans in this portfolio are generally underwritten individually and are usually 
table of contents secured with the assets of the company and or the personal guarantee of the business owners 
also considered as commercial loans are owner occupied commercial real estate loans to businesses for long term financing of land and buildings 
regions attempts to minimize risk on owner occupied properties by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount  adequate cash flow to service the debt  and  in many cases  the personal guarantees of principals of the borrowers 
net charge offs on commercial loans were percent in compared to percent in investor real estate the investor real estate portfolio segment totaled billion at year end and includes various loan types 
a large component of investor real estate loans is extensions of credit to real estate developers and investors for the financing of land or buildings  where the repayment is generated from the sale of the real estate or income generated by the real estate property 
net charge offs on commercial investor real estate mortgage loans continued to trend upward  from percent in to percent in reflecting continued credit pressure 
commercial investor real estate construction loans are primarily extensions of credit to real estate developers or investors where repayment is dependent on the sale of real estate or income generated from the real estate collateral 
these loans are generally underwritten and managed by a specialized real estate group that also manages loan disbursements during the construction process 
net charge offs on commercial investor real estate construction loans rose substantially  from percent in to percent in losses on sales or transfers to held for sale of non performing investor real estate loans also contributed to the year over year increase in net charge offs 
the following chart presents detail of regions billion investor real estate portfolio as of december  dollars in billions logo beginning in late  the land  single family and condominium components of the investor real estate portfolio segment came under significant pressure 
credit quality of the investor real estate portfolio is sensitive to risks associated with construction loans such as cost overruns  project completion risk  general contractor credit risk  environmental and other hazard risks  and market risks associated with the sale or rental of completed properties 
certain components of the investor real estate portfolio segment carry a higher risk of non collection 
while losses within these loan types were influenced by conditions described above  the most significant drivers of losses were the continued decline in demand for residential real estate and in the value of property 

table of contents the following table presents credit metrics for land  single family and condominium loans at december table land  single family and condominium in millions  net of unearned income land loan balance accruing loans days past due non accruing loans single family loan balance accruing loans days past due non accruing loans condominium loan balance accruing loans days past due non accruing loans excludes non accruing loans held for sale 
beginning in and continuing through  regions has strategically reduced exposures in these product types through pro active workouts  asset dispositions and charge offs 
condominium has been reduced to levels that management no longer considers to be significant exposures 
in  regions executed a bulk sale of non performing assets which totaled million 
non accrual portfolio loans secured predominantly by land represented approximately million of the sale  with the remaining amount primarily comprised of foreclosed property and loans held for sale 
accordingly  this transaction contributed to the decrease in non accruing loans in the land table above 
other non bulk note sale activity in also contributed to decreases in all of these categories 
beginning in  multi family and retail loans experienced increased pressure and contributed to increases in non accrual loans 
continued weak economic conditions impacted demand for products and services in these sectors 
lower demand impacted cash flows generated by these properties  leading to a higher rate of non collection for these types of loans 
offsetting the risk of non collection is the geographic diversity of regions exposure 
the following table presents credit metrics and geographic distribution for regions multi family and retail loans at december table multi family and retail in millions  net of unearned income multi family loan balance accruing loans days past due non accruing loans the majority of the december  balance related to multi family loans is geographically distributed throughout the following areas texas percent  florida percent  georgia percent  tennessee percent  louisiana percent and north carolina percent 
all other states  none of which comprise more than percent  make up the remainder of the balance 
excludes non accruing loans held for sale 

table of contents in millions  net of unearned income retail loan balance accruing loans days past due non accruing loans the majority of the december  balance related to retail loans is geographically distributed throughout the following areas florida percent  texas percent  georgia percent  alabama percent  tennessee percent and north carolina percent 
all other states  none of which comprise more than percent  make up the remainder of the balance 
excludes non accruing loans held for sale 
strategic reductions in investor real estate exposures as discussed above drove the year over year decreases in multi family and retail 
while the multi family category experienced an increase in non accrual loans due to economic factors  this category was not a major contributor to the year over year change in total non accrual loans 
residential first mortgage the residential first mortgage portfolio primarily contains loans to individuals  which are secured by single family residences that are originated through regions branch network 
loans of this type are generally smaller in size than commercial or investor real estate loans and are geographically dispersed throughout regions market areas  with some guaranteed by government agencies or private mortgage insurers 
losses on the residential loan portfolio depend  to a large degree  on the level of interest rates  the unemployment rate  economic conditions and collateral values 
during  losses on single family residences totaled percent  basis points higher than in the previous year  primarily driven by declining property values  foreclosures and other influential economic factors  such as the unemployment rate 
the company calculates an estimate of the current value of property secured as collateral for residential first mortgage lending products current ltv 
the estimate is based on home price indices compiled by the federal housing finance agency fhfa 
the fhfa data indicates trends for metropolitan statistical areas msa 
regions uses the fhfa valuation trends from the msas in the company s footprint in its estimate 
the trend data is applied to the loan portfolios taking into account the age of the most recent valuation and geographic area 
at december   the company estimates that the number of residential first mortgage loans where the current ltv exceeded percent was approximately percent  while approximately percent of the outstanding balances of residential first mortgage loans had a current ltv greater than percent 
home equity the home equity portfolio totaled billion at december   as compared to billion at december  substantially all of this portfolio was originated through regions branch network 
losses in this portfolio generally track overall economic conditions 
the main source of economic stress has been in florida  where residential property values have declined significantly while unemployment rates have risen to historically high levels 
losses on relationships in florida where regions is in a second lien position are higher than first lien losses 
using the same methodology described in the above discussion of residential first mortgage loans  at december   the company estimates that the number of home equity loans where the current ltv exceeded percent was approximately percent  while approximately percent of the outstanding balances of home equity loans had a current ltv greater than percent 
if the home equity loan is in a second lien position  the first lien has also been considered in the analysis 
if the first lien position is with another institution  the company uses the first lien outstanding balance at the time the second lien was originated 

table of contents the table below provides details related to the home equity lending portfolio for the years ended december table selected home equity portfolio information year ended december  florida all other states total st lien nd lien total st lien nd lien total st lien nd lien total dollars in millions balance net charge offs net charge off year ended december  florida all other states total st lien nd lien total st lien nd lien total st lien nd lien total dollars in millions balance net charge offs net charge off net charge off percentages are calculated on an annualized basis as a percent of average balances 
indirect and other consumer lending indirect lending  which is lending initiated through third party business partners  is largely comprised of loans made through automotive dealerships 
this portfolio class decreased million or percent in  reflecting the suspension of new originations within the indirect auto lending business and the suspension of the marine and recreational vehicle lending business 
beginning in late  the company re entered the indirect auto lending business 
other consumer loans  which consist primarily of borrowings for home improvements  automobiles  overdrafts and other personal household purposes  totaled billion as of year end and were relatively unchanged from prior year s balance 
losses on indirect and other consumer lending increased in due to deterioration of general economic conditions  but stabilized in allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of year end 
the allowance for credit losses consists of two components the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments 
management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based on a combination of both of these components 
regions determines its allowance for credit losses in accordance with applicable accounting literature as well as regulatory guidance related to receivables and contingencies 
binding unfunded credit commitments include items such as letters of credit  financial guarantees and binding unfunded loan commitments 
allowance process factors considered by management in determining the adequacy of the allowance include  but are not limited to detailed reviews of individual loans  historical and current trends in gross and net loan charge offs for the various classes of loans evaluated  the company s policies relating to delinquent loans and charge offs  the level of the allowance in relation to total loans and to historical loss levels  levels and trends in non performing and past due loans  collateral values of properties securing loans  the composition of the loan portfolio  including unfunded credit commitments  management s analysis of current economic conditions  migration of loans between risk rating categories  and estimation of inherent credit losses in the portfolio 
in support of collateral values  regions obtains updated valuations for non performing loans on at least an annual basis 

table of contents commercial and consumer credit risk management and special assets are all involved in the credit risk management process to assess the accuracy of risk ratings  the quality of the portfolio and the estimation of inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio 
this comprehensive process also assists in the prompt identification of problem credits 
the company has taken a number of measures to manage the portfolios and reduce risk  particularly in the more problematic portfolios 
in addition  a strong customer assistance program is in place which educates customers about options and initiates early contact with customers to discuss solutions when a loan first becomes delinquent 
for loans that are not specifically reviewed  management uses information from its ongoing review processes to stratify the loan portfolio into pools sharing common risk characteristics 
loans that share common risk characteristics are assigned a portion of the allowance for credit losses based on the assessment process described above 
credit exposures are categorized by type and assigned estimated amounts of inherent loss based on several factors  including current and historical loss experience for each pool and management s judgment of current economic conditions and their expected impact on credit performance 
adjustments to the allowance for credit losses calculated using a pooled approach are recorded through the provision for loan losses or noninterest expense  as applicable 
as a matter of business practice  regions may require some form of credit support  such as a guarantee 
guarantees are legally binding and entered into simultaneously with the primary loan agreements 
regions underwrites the ability of each guarantor to perform under its guarantee in the same manner and to the same extent as would be required to underwrite the repayment plan of a direct obligor 
this entails obtaining sufficient information on the guarantor  including financial and operating information  to sufficiently measure a guarantor s ability to perform  under the guarantee 
however  the benefit assigned to credit support within the calculation of the allowance for credit losses is not material to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the allowance for loan losses totaled billion or percent of total loans  net of unearned income compared to billion or percent at year end the increase in the allowance for loan loss ratio reflects management s estimate of the level of inherent losses in the portfolio  which stabilized during  as well as a result of the decline in the loan portfolio balance 
non performing assets decreased from billion at december  to billion at december   reflecting management s efforts to work through problem assets 
higher levels of charge offs in as described below were also a factor in the allowance for credit losses 
net charge offs as a percentage of average loans were percent and percent in and  respectively 
charge off ratios were higher across most major classes 
investor real estate losses were the largest contributor  reflecting increased charge offs in the land  single family and retail components of investor real estate 
increased charge offs reflect the impact of opportunistic asset dispositions 
net charge offs on home equity rose to percent in versus percent in losses from florida based credits were again particularly high  as property valuations in certain markets continued to experience deterioration 
these loans and lines represent approximately billion of regions total home equity portfolio at december  of that balance  approximately billion represents first liens  second liens  which total billion  were the main source of losses 
florida second lien losses were percent in total home equity losses in florida amounted to percent of loans and lines versus percent across the remainder of regions footprint in management expects charge offs to moderate going forward  but will likely remain elevated 
real estate valuations and unemployment will impact the future level of charge offs 
management considers the current level of allowance for credit losses adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio and unfunded commitments 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance for 
table of contents credit losses  which is based on the factors and risk identification procedures previously discussed  requires the use of judgments and estimations that may change in the future 
changes in the factors used by management to determine the adequacy of the allowance or the availability of new information could cause the allowance for credit losses to be increased or decreased in future periods 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies  as part of their examination process  may require changes in the level of the allowance based on their judgments and estimates 
details regarding the allowance for credit losses  including an analysis of activity from the previous year s total  are included in table allowance for credit losses 
management expects the allowance for credit losses to total loans ratio to vary over time due to changes in portfolio balances  economic conditions  loan mix and collateral values  or variations in other factors that may affect inherent losses

commercial and investor real estate impaired loans with outstanding balances equal to or greater than million are evaluated individually for impairment 
for these loans  regions measures the level of impairment based on the present value of the estimated projected cash flows  the estimated value of the collateral or  if available  the observable market prices 
for consumer tdrs  
table of contents regions measures the level of impairment based on pools of loans stratified by common risk characteristics 
if current valuations are lower than the current book balance of the credit  the negative differences are reviewed for possible charge off 
in instances where management determines that a charge off is not appropriate  a specific reserve is established for the individual loan in question 
this specific reserve is incorporated as a part of the overall allowance for credit losses 
the recorded investment in impaired loans was approximately billion at december  and billion at december  loans that were characterized as tdrs totaled billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
the allowance allocated to tdrs totaled million and million at december  and  respectively

regions continues to work to meet the individual needs of consumer borrowers to stem foreclosure through the customer assistance program cap 
regions designed the program to allow for customer tailored modifications with the goal of keeping customers in their homes and avoiding foreclosure where possible 
modification may be offered to any borrower experiencing financial hardship regardless of the borrower s payment status 
under the cap  regions may offer a short term deferral  a term extension  an interest rate reduction  a new loan product  or a combination of these options 
regions evaluates the success of the modification program the recidivism rate 
the recidivism rate is the day and greater delinquency rate inclusive of non accruing loans for all tdrs which were restructured six months or prior to the reporting period 
for cap modifications  this rate is currently approximately percent 
for loans restructured under cap  regions expects to collect the original contractually due principal 
the gross original contractual interest may be collectible  depending on the terms modified 
the length of the cap modifications ranges from temporary payment deferrals of three months to term extensions for the life of the loan 
all such modifications are considered tdrs regardless of the term if there is a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty 
modified loans are subject to policies governing accrual nonaccrual evaluation consistent with all other loans of the same product type 
consumer loans are subject to objective accrual nonaccrual decisions 
under these policies  loans subject to cap are charged down to estimated value and placed on nonaccrual status on or before the month in which the loan becomes days past due 
because the program was designed to evaluate potential cap participants as early as possible in the lifecycle of the troubled loan  many of the modifications are finalized without the borrower ever reaching days past due  and with the loans having never been placed on nonaccrual 
accordingly  given the positive impact of the restructuring on the likelihood of recovery of cash flows due under the modified terms  accrual status continues to be appropriate for these loans 
none of the modified consumer loans listed in the tdr disclosures were collateral dependent at the time of modification 
at december   approximately million in residential first mortgage tdrs and approximately million in home equity tdrs were in excess of days past due and are considered collateral dependent 

table of contents residential first mortgage  home equity and other consumer tdrs are consumer loans modified under the cap

non performing assets non performing assets consist of loans on non accrual status and foreclosed properties 
loans are placed on non accrual status when management has determined that payment of all contractual principal and interest is in doubt  or the loan is past due days or more as to principal and interest unless well secured and in the process of collection 
when a commercial loan is placed on non accrual status  uncollected interest accrued in the current year is reversed and charged to interest income 
uncollected interest accrued from prior years on commercial loans placed on non accrual status in the current year is charged against the allowance for loan losses 
when a consumer loan is placed on non accrual status  all uncollected interest accrued is reversed and charged to interest income 
at december   non performing assets totaled billion  or percent of ending loans and other real estate  compared to billion  or percent of loans of loans and other real estate  at december  the decrease in non performing assets during the year ended december  reflects the company s efforts to work through problem assets and reduce the riskiest exposures 

table of contents foreclosed properties  a subset of non performing assets  totaled million at december  and million at december   reflecting dispositions and valuation charges due to continued stress on property values 
regions foreclosed properties are composed primarily of a number of small to medium size properties that are diversified geographically throughout the franchise 
foreclosed properties are recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan or fair value less the estimated cost to sell 
table non performing assets presents information on non performing loans and foreclosed properties acquired in settlement of loans 
management expects non performing assets to stabilize going forward  but will likely remain elevated as compared to historical levels 
economic trends such as real estate valuations and unemployment will impact the future level of non performing assets

financial disclosure and internal controls regions has always maintained internal controls over financial reporting  which generally include those controls relating to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us regions process for evaluating internal controls over financial reporting starts with understanding the risks facing each of its functions and areas  how those risks are controlled or mitigated  and how management monitors those controls to ensure that they are in place and effective 
these risks  control procedures and monitoring tools are documented in a standard format 
this format not only documents the internal control structures over all significant accounts  but also places responsibility on management for establishing feedback mechanisms to ensure that controls are effective 
these monitoring procedures are also part of management s testing of internal controls 
at least quarterly  each area updates and assesses the adequacy of its documented internal controls 
if changes are necessary  updates are made more frequently 

table of contents regions has also established processes to ensure appropriate disclosure controls and procedures are maintained 
these controls and procedures as defined by the securities and exchange commission sec are generally designed to ensure that financial and non financial information required to be disclosed in reports filed with the sec is reported within the time periods specified in the sec s rules and forms  and that such information is communicated to management  including the chief executive officer ceo and chief financial officer cfo  as appropriate  to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 
regions disclosure review committee  which includes representatives from the legal  risk management  accounting  investor relations and audit departments  meets quarterly to review recent internal and external events to determine whether all appropriate disclosures have been made in reports filed with the sec 
in addition  the ceo and cfo meet quarterly with the sec filings review committee  which includes senior representatives from accounting  legal  risk management  audit  and operations and technology  as well as from the core business segments 
the sec filings review committee reviews certain reports to be filed with the sec  including forms k and q and evaluates the adequacy and accuracy of the disclosures 
as part of this process  certifications of internal control effectiveness are obtained from all core business segments  accounting  legal  risk management  and operations and technology 
these certifications are reviewed and presented to the ceo and cfo as evidence of the company s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting 
the forms k and q are presented to the audit committee of the board of directors for approval 
financial results and other financial information are also reviewed with the audit committee on a quarterly basis 
as required by applicable regulatory pronouncements  the ceo and the cfo review and make various certifications regarding the accuracy of regions periodic public reports filed with the sec  as well as the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting 
with the assistance of the financial review committees  regions will continue to assess and monitor disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting  and will make refinements as necessary 
comparison of with regions reported a net loss available to common shareholders of billion or per diluted common share in significant drivers of results include an elevated provision for loan losses and pressured net interest income 
offsetting these items to some extent was regions solid fee and mortgage income 
net loss from continuing operations in was billion  or per diluted common share  compared to net loss from continuing operations of billion  or per diluted share in regions incurred an million pre tax loss related to equifirst resulting in an after tax net loss of million  for the year ended december   which was accounted for as discontinued operations

net interest income was billion in compared to billion in the net interest margin taxable equivalent basis was percent in  compared to percent during the decline in the net interest margin was impacted primarily by factors directly and indirectly associated with the erosion of economic and industry conditions since late these factors include regions asset sensitive balance sheet  which was impacted by an unfavorable decline in the general level and shape of the yield curve  higher spreads on new debt issuances  and rising non performing asset levels 
additionally  loan yields declined throughout the year  as variable rate loans fell in response to declines in the short term rates to which they are tied 
declining deposit rates partially offset these movements  but the decline was somewhat limited by the competitive demand for deposits within the industry  largely prompted by stressed economic conditions throughout the us the following discussion of non interest income and expense is from continuing operations and excludes equifirst  which is reported separately as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
non interest income totaled billion in  compared to billion in the increase in non interest 
table of contents income was primarily due to revenue generated from unwinding certain leveraged lease transactions during the year 
however  this revenue was more than offset by the related income tax expense  resulting in an insignificant aggregate impact to net income 
excluding the leveraged lease terminations  results reflected an increase in mortgage income  primarily due to customers taking advantage of historically low mortgage rates  which drove higher mortgage originations and slightly higher service charges income 
in addition  non interest income was aided by a gain on the early extinguishment of debt realized in connection with the company s issuance of common stock in exchange for trust preferred securities 
offsetting the non interest income increases  brokerage  investment banking and capital markets revenue decreased in to million compared to billion in due to lower fees from investment banking and capital markets 
in addition  trust income fees were negatively impacted by lower asset valuations due to the disarray in the markets during the year 
non interest income excluding securities transactions and leveraged lease gains as a percent of total revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis equaled percent in compared to percent in the increase is primarily due to higher mortgage income and a decline in net interest income in service charges on deposit accounts increased percent to billion in from billion in this modest increase was the result of an increase in interchange income due to higher volumes  partially offset by a decline in overdraft and insufficient funds revenues 
total revenues from overdrafts and insufficient funds charges were million in and million in in  mortgage income increased million  or percent to million 
the increase was due to increased refinance activity as customers took advantage of historically low mortgage rates  resulting in billion in mortgage originations during the year  compared to billion in market valuation adjustments for mortgage servicing rights and related derivatives added million to mortgage income in no such income was recorded in the previous year 
regions reported net gains of million from the sale of securities available for sale in  compared to net gains of million in during  the company significantly reduced its exposure in non agency investment securities  collateralized mortgage backed securities and municipal securities and through these measures incurred some losses on the sales 
the company s gains were due to increased sales activity within the available for sale category as part of the company s asset liability management strategies 
the proceeds from the sales in and were reinvested in us government agency mortgage backed securities classified as available for sale

non interest expense was billion in  reflecting higher securities impairments and fdic insurance costs 
salaries and employee benefits decreased percent to billion in compared to billion in  included in total salaries and employee benefits in are merger charges totaling million 
the year over year decrease in salaries and employee benefits cost is the due to a percent decline in headcount

also  included in net occupancy expense in were merger charges of million  reflecting costs to vacate leases due to the merger 
furniture and equipment expense decreased million to million in this decrease is primarily due to lower depreciation  however branch consolidation charges of million partially offset the decreases 
included in furniture and equipment expense were merger charges of million in 
table of contents professional and legal fees are comprised of amounts related to legal  consulting and other professional fees 
these fees increased million to million in included in professional fees during were million of merger related charges

the fdic made a number of changes to its assessment rate schedule  which drove the increase in premium rates 
the bank regulatory agencies ratings  comprised of regions bank s capital  asset quality  management  earnings  liquidity and sensitivity to risk  along with its long term debt issuer ratings and financial ratios  were the primary factors in determining fdic insurance premiums 
other miscellaneous expenses include communications  and business development services 
other miscellaneous expenses decreased million to million in included in other miscellaneous expenses are merger charges totaling million in the decline in was attributable to several factors 
as discussed above  in january  regions began accounting for mortgage servicing rights at fair market value with any changes to fair value being recorded in mortgage income 
at that time  regions was no longer required to adjust non interest expense for amortization of mortgage servicing rights 
the impact of the amortization expense for was million and there was no corresponding impact in also  included in other non interest expense in was million of write downs on investments in two morgan keegan mutual funds with no similar expense during regions benefit for income taxes from continuing operations decreased million to a tax benefit of million compared to a tax benefit of million in the decrease in the benefit is primarily related to the tax expenses on leveraged lease terminations in net charge offs totaled billion  or percent of average loans in compared to billion  or percent of average loans in the increased loss rate reflected ongoing pressure in property valuations and continued strains in the economy as a whole

during the provision for loan losses was billion and net charge offs were billion 
this compares to a 
table of contents provision for loan losses of billion and net charge offs of billion in the increase in the provision was primarily due to focused efforts to identify and address loan portfolio pressure  as well as continued deterioration in the land  single family  condominium and home equity portfolios 
income producing investor real estate  including multi family and retail  also contributed to the increased level of non performing loans  which significantly impacts the level of the provision 
at december   the allowance for loan losses totaled billion or percent of total loans  net of unearned income compared to billion or percent at year end the increase in the allowance for loan loss ratio reflects management s estimate of the level of inherent losses in the portfolio  which continued to increase during due to a recessionary economy  rising unemployment  a weakened housing market and deterioration in income producing properties 
the increase in non performing assets  driven by land  single family and condominium loans and income producing investor real estate loans  was a key determining dynamic in the assessment of inherent losses and  as a result  was an important factor in determining the allowance level 
additionally  unfavorable migration between risk rating categories drove higher allowance allocation rates for these loan portfolios
