table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  management objective of a fair presentation of financial information is achieved through a system of internal accounting controls 
the financial control system of premier is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded from loss and that transactions are properly authorized and recorded in the financial records 
as an integral part of that financial control system  the holding company employs a staff of internal auditors and contracts with professional accounting firms to perform internal audits of the financial records of each of the subsidiaries on a periodic basis 
the internal audit manager reports the findings and recommendations highlighted by the internal audits to premier s audit committee as well as the audit committees of the subsidiaries 
also  on a regular periodic basis  the subsidiary banks are examined by federal and state banking authorities for safety and soundness as well as compliance with applicable banking laws and regulations 
the activities of both the internal and external audit functions are reviewed by the audit committee of the board of directors 
forward looking statements management discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future financial performance 
however  such performance involves risks and uncertainties  and there are certain important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
these important factors include  but are not limited to  economic conditions both generally and more specifically in the markets in which premier operates  competition for premier customers from other providers of financial services  government legislation and regulation which changes from time to time  changes in interest rates  premier ability to originate quality loans  collect delinquent loans and attract and retain deposits  the impact of premier growth or lack thereof  premier ability to control costs  and new accounting pronouncements  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of premier 
the words may  could  should  would  will  believe  anticipate  estimate  expect  intend  plan  project  predict  continue and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies general the financial condition and results of operations presented in the 
consolidated financial statements  accompanying 
notes to the consolidated financial statements and management discussion and analysis are  to a large degree  dependent upon our accounting policies 
the selection and application of these accounting policies involve judgments  estimates  and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 

table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  presented below is a discussion of those accounting policies that management believes are the most important to the presentation and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
these critical accounting policies require management most difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood

note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this annual report 
allowance for loan losses the company monitors and maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb an estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the company maintains policies and procedures that address the systems of control over the following areas of maintenance of the allowance the systematic methodology used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance to provide assurance that the allowance for loan losses is maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the accounting policies for loan charge offs and recoveries  the assessment and measurement of impairment in the loan portfolio  and the loan grading system 
the company evaluates various loans individually for impairment using accounting guidance issued by financial accounting standards board fasb 
loans evaluated individually for impairment include non performing loans  such as loans on non accrual  loans past due days or more  restructured loans and other loans selected by management including loans graded as substandard or doubtful by the internal credit review process 
the evaluations are based upon discounted expected cash flows or collateral valuations 
if the evaluation shows that a loan is individually impaired  then a specific reserve is established for the amount of impairment 
for loans without individual measures of impairment  the company makes estimates of losses for groups of loans as required by accounting guidance 
loans are grouped by similar characteristics  including the type of loan  the assigned loan grade and the general collateral type 
a loss rate reflecting the expected loss inherent in a group of loans is derived based upon estimates of default rates for a given loan grade  the predominant collateral type for the group and the terms of the loan 
the resulting estimate of losses for groups of loans is adjusted for relevant environmental factors and other conditions of the portfolio of loans  including borrower and industry concentrations  levels and trends in delinquencies  charge offs and recoveries  changes in underwriting standards and risk selection  level of experience  ability and depth of lending management  and national and local economic conditions 

table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  the amount of estimated impairment for individually evaluated loans and groups of loans is added together for a total estimate of probable incurred loan losses 
this estimate of losses is compared to the allowance for loan losses of the company as of the evaluation date and  if the estimate of losses exceeds the allowance  an additional provision to the allowance would be made 
if the estimate of losses is less than the allowance  the degree to which the allowance exceeds the estimate is evaluated to determine whether the allowance falls outside a range of estimates 
if the estimate of losses were below the range of reasonable estimates  the allowance would be reduced by way of a credit to the provision for loan losses 
the company recognizes the inherent imprecision in estimates of losses due to various uncertainties and variability related to the factors used  and therefore a reasonable range around the estimate of losses is derived and used to ascertain whether the allowance is too high 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail and it is determined that the allowance is not adequate to absorb the new estimate of probable incurred losses  an additional provision for loan losses would be made  which amount may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
business acquisitions and impairment of goodwill for acquisitions  premier is required to record the assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  and the liabilities assumed at their fair value 
these often involve estimates based on third party valuations  such as appraisals  or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques that may include estimates of attrition  inflation  asset growth rates or other relevant factors 
in addition  the determination of the useful lives over which an intangible asset will be amortized is subjective 
the loans acquired via the purchase of abigail adams and the branch purchase were recorded on the books of premier at their estimated fair value 
the estimate of fair value included factors for the measurement of credit risk  interest rate risk and re salability in the most advantageous market for the loans in an orderly transaction between market participants 
these estimates required management most difficult  subjective and complex judgments and are inherently uncertain 
since the estimated fair value of these loans were believed to have accounted for the reasonably estimable credit risk in the loans  consistent with new accounting guidance for acquisitions after  no allowance for loan losses for these loans was recorded by premier at the date of acquisition 
however  in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail due to uncertainties in the economy  the borrower s ability to repay or other factors  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood 
under accounting guidance issued by the fasb related to accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is evaluated at least annually to determine if the amount recorded on the company balance sheet is impaired 
if goodwill is determined to be impaired  the recorded amount would be reduced to estimated fair value by a charge to expense in the period in which impairment is determined 
impairment is evaluated in the aggregate for all of 
table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  the company banking operations 
operating characteristics of the aggregate banking operations are derived and compared to a database of peer group banks that have been sold 
pricing valuation factors that are considered in estimating the fair value of the company aggregate banking operations include price to total assets  price to total book value  price to deposits and price to earnings 
unusual events that have impacted the operating characteristics of the company aggregate banking operations are considered to assess the likelihood of recurrence and adjustments to historical performance may be made 
changes in assumptions regarding the likelihood of unusual historical events recurring or the use of different pricing valuation factors could have a material impact on management impairment analysis 
summary financial results premier had net income available to common shareholders of million in compared to million of net income available to common shareholders in and million of net income reported for net income available to common shareholders decreased in due to a million gain recorded in on the acquisition of abigail adams and a full four quarters of preferred stock dividends subtracted from net income in compared to only one quarter in otherwise  net income increased in due to higher interest income and non interest income as well as lower interest expense  which were partially offset by higher provisions for loan losses and higher non interest expense 
the increase in each of these categories was primarily the result of the increase in operations from the acquisitions of abigail adams on october  when comparing operating results to operating results  the operations of abigail adams are included in the full year of but in only the last three months of in  higher interest income and non interest income as well as lower interest expense were partially offset by higher non interest expense 
the increases in each of these categories was primarily the result of the increase in operations from the acquisitions of abigail adams on october   and citizens first and traders  both of which occurred at the close of business on april  the operating results of abigail adams  citizens first and traders are included in the consolidated financial statements of premier only from the date of their respective acquisition 
when comparing operating results to operating results  the operations of abigail adams are included only for the last three months of and none at all in similarly  the operations of citizens first and traders are included for the full twelve months of but only for the last eight months of basic earnings per share were in compared to in and to in the decrease in earnings per share in is largely due to the impact of the million bargain purchase gain which added approximately to premier s reported earnings per share in earnings per share in were also negatively impacted by the increase in the full year average number of shares outstanding resulting from the acquisition of abigail adams late in the increase in earnings per share in resulted from a proportionately greater increase in net income available to common shareholders from the acquisition of abigail adams  including the bargain purchase gain  versus the increase in average shares outstanding issued to acquire the entity 
the terms of the acquisitions are more fully described in

management s discussion and analysis december  the following table comparatively illustrates the components of roa and roe over the previous five years 
return on average assets roa measures how effectively premier utilizes its assets to produce net income 
it also facilitates the analysis of earnings performance of different sized organizations 
in  and  premier increased the size of its balance sheet from million at the end of to  million at the end of to  million at the end of  largely due to acquisitions 
the increase in asset size will generally result in higher dollars of income earned and expenses incurred 
a detailed review of the components of roa will help analyze premier s performance without regard to changes in its size 
premier s net income available to common shareholders in resulted in an roa of  a decrease from the roa in and the in as shown in the following table  fully taxable equivalent net interest income as a percent of average earning assets reached its highest level during the last five years in at 
in  this percentage decreased to and decreased again in to as yields on earning assets declined as a result of a lower overall interest rate environment due to federal reserve policies designed to stimulate national economic growth 
in  fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased to as the average interest rate paid on interest bearing liabilities fell more quickly in than the yield earned on average earning assets 
in  net credit income was of average earning assets as negative provisions for loan losses were recorded which served to help increase net credit income to the highest annual level over the five year period presented 
in  while net interest income increased to its highest level  net credit income was lower than as a result of minimal negative provisions for loan losses recorded in however  in  non interest income as a percent of average earning assets also reached its highest level in the past five years while non interest expense as a percent of average earning assets declined 
in  minimal provisions for loan losses reduced an already lower net interest income as a percent of average earning assets  resulting in net credit income of of average earning assets 
in  non interest income as a percent of average earning assets declined somewhat  returning to the level achieved in however  non interest expense as a percent of average earning assets continued to decline in resulting in the lowest ratio over in the last five years 
in  net credit income as a percent of average earning assets declined to  as the lower net interest income described above was lowered even further by a higher provision for loan losses as a percent of average earning assets 
further lowering premier s return on average assets in was lower non interest income and the highest non interest expense as a percent of average earning assets in the last five years largely due to acquisition related expenses  a special fdic insurance assessment  and write downs on the value of other real estate owned oreo 
adding to premier s return on average assets in was a gain recognized on the acquisition of abigail adams and lower income tax expense 
as illustrated in the table  the overall result was to decrease premier return on average earning assets to and decrease its return on average total assets roa to 

table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  in  the increase in net interest income as a percent of average earning assets was more than offset by an increase in the provision for loan losses as a percent of average earning assets lowering net credit income to of average earning assets  the lowest percentage in the five year period presented 
further lowering premier s return on average assets in was lower non interest income as a percent of average earning assets due to lower deposit customer fee income in relation to the total deposits outstanding and no gain on the acquisition of a subsidiary as was recorded in on the positive side  non interest expenses as a percent of average earning assets decreased in to compared to in  largely due to reduced acquisition related expenses and lower oreo costs due to gains realized on the disposition of some oreo properties in income tax expense as a percentage of average earning assets was the lowest level in  largely due to the reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance recorded on the recognition of future west virginia net operating losses 
lastly  dividends and accretion accrued on premier s series a preferred stock also serve to reduce net income available to common shareholders and thus reduce premier s roa 
in  preferred stock dividends and accretion totaled as a percent of average earning assets 
as illustrated in the table  the overall result was to decrease premier return on average earning assets to and decrease its return on average total assets roa to

management s discussion and analysis december  the net overhead ratio non interest expense less non interest income as a percent of average earning assets decreased in to 
this ratio compares favorably to the net overhead ratio in  but is still higher than the reported in  in  the lowest ratio reported in the last five years  and in the decrease in net overhead was largely the result of a lower ratio of non interest expense to average earning assets due to operational savings  lower acquisition expenses and gains on the sale of some oreo in compared to in  the higher net overhead ratio was largely the result of a higher ratio of non interest expense to average earning assets due to acquisition related expenses  significantly higher fdic insurance costs  higher oreo costs and generally less efficient operations of the acquired abigail adams subsidiary banks 
negatively affecting the net overhead ratio was a lower ratio of non interest income to average earnings assets largely due to the lower non interest income ratio of the acquired abigail adams banks compared to the historical results of premier s other subsidiary banks 
the lower non interest income ratio of the acquired abigail adams banks and a slight decrease in secondary market mortgage commissions had a negative effect on the net overhead ratio as well 
the increase in the net overhead ratio when compared to was largely the result of a lower ratio of non interest income to average earning assets due to lower secondary market mortgage commissions overall and the non interest income ratio of the citizens first and traders banks acquired in return on average common equity roe  another measure of earnings performance  indicates the amount of net income earned in relation to the total equity invested by holders of common stock 
premier s roe was compared to in and realized in roe decreased in due to the significantly lower roa in  offsetting the benefits of a higher ratio of average assets to average equity in roe increased in due to a higher ratio of average assets to average equity resulting from the abigail adams acquisition

management s discussion and analysis december  loan portfolio premier s loan portfolio is its largest and highest yielding component of average earning assets  totaling of average earning assets during average loans increased in by million or over following a million or increase in over the increase is largely attributable to the full year impact of the acquisition of abigail adams in  which increased average total loans by million in excluding the increase attributed to the abigail adams acquisition  average total loans increased by million or in from this increase is the result of growth in premier s ohio  kentucky and west virginia loan markets 
in  premier realized a million or million increase in average outstanding loans in its kentucky markets  a million or increase in its west virginia markets  and a million increase in its ohio markets 
a significant portion of the loan growth in these markets came from the loans acquired via the branch purchase in september the increase is largely attributable to the acquisition activity in and which added million in average total loans during the year 
excluding the acquisitions  average total loans increased by million or in from this increase is the result of growth in premier s ohio and west virginia loan markets 
in  premier realized a million or increase in average outstanding loans in its ohio markets  and a million or increase in its west virginia markets excluding traders and citizens first 
average total loans in premier s kentucky markets were relatively the same from to total loans at december  increased by million or from the total at december  this increase follows a million or increase from the total at december  the increase in is largely due to the increases in loans at premier s kentucky  west virginia and ohio banks which more than offset loan payments and payoffs at premier s dc and virginia banks 
total loans in the dc market decreased by million in  while loans in the virginia market decreased by million 
these decreases were more than offset by the million increase in loans in premier s other markets  largely due to the million of loans acquired via the branch purchase in september the significant increase in is due to the million of period end loans from the acquisition of abigail adams 
the remaining banks collectively had a million or decrease in their total period end loans as increases in total loans at the west virginia and ohio banks were more than offset by decreases at the kentucky banks 
loans secured by real estate totaled of premier s loan portfolio at december   down from the of total loans at december  the decease is largely due to a decrease in construction loans outstanding 
in  loans secured by real estate in total increased from of premier s loan portfolio at december  to approximately of premier loan portfolio at december  due to the loans acquired from abigail adams 
the mix of loans acquired from abigail adams was significantly different from premier s other affiliate bank loan portfolios  which consist of a diverse portfolio of predominantly single family residential loans and loans for commercial purposes where real estate is part of the 
table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  collateral  not the primary source of repayment 
the december  balances of the loans acquired from adams national were predominantly commercial real estate loans and real estate construction loans  including million of loans secured by non owner occupied commercial property  million of loans secured by owner occupied commercial property  million of multi family residential real estate loans and million of commercial real estate construction and land development loans 
the concentrations in these kinds of loans was one of the factors motivating the occ to require adams national to enter into a formal written agreement to reduce these concentrations 
the mix of december  balances of the loans acquired from cb t were closer to the ratios of premier s other affiliate banks but were still predominantly commercial real estate loans and real estate construction loans due in part to loan participations with adams national 
while there are generally additional risks of loss associated with commercial real estate lending  such as the potential for adverse changes in economic conditions  the borrowers inability to successfully execute their business plan and or deterioration in the value of the commercial real estate collateral  the loans acquired from adams national and cb t were recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date taking into account credit risks in the loans acquired 
see additional discussion below on the impaired loans acquired from adams national and cb t 
premier s residential real estate mortgage loans generally do not exceed of the value of the real property securing the loan at the time of origination 
the residential real estate mortgage loan portfolio primarily consists of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans 
the origination of these mortgage loans can be more difficult in a low interest rate environment where there is a significant demand for fixed rate mortgages 
premier also originates mortgage loans to be sold in the secondary market and recognizes non interest income upon the sale of those mortgages in the form of commissions and servicing release fees 
premier has not engaged in the solicitation of so called sub prime or interest only mortgages 
premier uses an experienced staff underwriter to ensure the completeness of the borrowers loan application and documentation and to ensure that the loans meet the standards required by prospective loan purchasers 
additional information regarding the volume of mortgage loans originated and sold is contained in premier s consolidated statements of cash flows presented elsewhere in this annual report 
commercial loans are generally made to small to medium size businesses located within a defined market area and typically are secured by business assets and guarantees of the principal owners 
additional risks of loss are associated with commercial lending  such as the potential for adverse changes in economic conditions or the borrowers ability to successfully execute their business plan 
consumer loans generally are made to individuals living in premier defined market area who are known to the local bank staff 
consumer loans are generally made for terms of up to seven years on a secured or unsecured basis  however longer terms may be approved in certain circumstances and for revolving credit lines 
while consumer loans generally provide the company with increased interest income  consumer loans may involve a greater risk of default

management s discussion and analysis december  the following table presents a five year comparison of loans by type

management s discussion and analysis december  in addition to the loans presented in the loan summary table  premier also offers certain off balance sheet products such as letters of credit  revolving credit agreements  and other loan commitments 
these products are offered under the same credit standards as the loan portfolio and are included in the risk based capital ratios used by the federal reserve to evaluate capital adequacy 
additional information on off balance sheet commitments is contained in 
note to the consolidated financial statements 
total non performing assets  which consist of past due loans on which interest is not being accrued non accrual loans  foreclosed properties in the process of liquidation oreo  loans with restructured terms offering a concession to enable a delinquent borrower to repay troubled debt restructurings and accruing loans past due days or more  were million or of total assets at year end these amounts compare to million of total non performing assets or of total assets at year end and million of total non performing assets or of total assets at year end the decrease in from year end was largely due to a reduction in troubled debt restructuring as restructuring plans were successful in helping borrowers get back on schedule with their loan payments 
otherwise  non accrual loans increased by million and oreo increased by million 
the significant increase in from year end is largely due to the non performing assets that came with the acquisition of abigail adams and its two subsidiary banks 
at december   these two banks accounted for million or of premier s non performing assets 
at december   the same two banks from abigail adams accounted for million or of premier s non performing assets  as an increase in non accrual loans at the two banks was substantially offset by a decrease in oreo 
however  since these assets were recorded at an estimated fair value on the date of acquisition  the amount of credit risk assumed by premier is not nearly as great as the volume of non performing assets suggests taken at face value 
the estimate of fair value on all loans  but particularly on non performing assets  included factors for the measurement of credit risk  interest rate risk and re salability in the most advantageous market for the loans in an orderly transaction between market participants 
these estimates included significant discounts on the non accrual loans 
since the estimated fair value of these loans were believed to have accounted for the reasonably estimable credit risk in the loans  consistent with new accounting guidance for acquisitions after  no allowance for loan losses for these loans was recorded at the date of acquisition 
under previous accounting standards  the loan loss allowance of acquired banks would have carried over to premier s books and records  as was the case for traders and citizens first

table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  the remaining million increase in non performing assets in is largely due to a million increase in restructured loans 
these loans were performing in accordance with their modified terms at december   but because the loan terms were modified to assist the borrower to repay the loan  the loans are included with total non performing assets 
most of premier s restructured loans are loans that have been modified to allow the borrower to pay interest only for a limited amount of time 
also included in the remaining million increase in non performing assets in is a  increase in non accrual loans offset by a  decrease in loans days past due and a  decrease in other real estate owned oreo 
the increase in total non performing assets in was largely due to the million of non performing assets at december  at the acquired traders bank 
in addition to the non accrual loans at traders bank  in a million increase in non accrual loans was largely offset by decreases in loans past due days or more and restructured loans 
management believes the estimated potential losses related to delinquent loans to be adequately provided for in the allowance for loan losses 
these non performing assets were included in the analyses that supported the recording of provisions for loan loss during and as management efforts to collect on all of the company s non performing assets continue  matured loans are only renewed using premier strengthened credit policies 
otherwise  loans may be placed on non accrual status and foreclosure proceedings begun to obtain and liquidate any collateral securing the past due or matured loans 
as previously demonstrated by premier s history  management is committed to continuing to reduce its level of non performing assets and maintaining strong underwriting standards to help maintain a lower level of non performing assets in the future 
this effort is revealed in the decline in non performing assets from the end of to the end of  primarily related to the sale of oreo properties and the decline in non accrual loans and loans days past due 
premier efforts at its other affiliate banks in and were masked by the high level of non performing assets at farmers deposit bank  which alone totaled million at december  at december   the non performing assets at farmers deposit bank had declined to million  leaving million of total non performing assets at the other affiliate banks combined 
by december   total non performing assets at farmers deposit bank had declined to million 
this experience and performance in pursuing the collection of non performing assets was a factor in management s decision to pursue the acquisition of abigail adams and its high level of non performing assets 
while the circumstances related to the collection of every non performing loan is different  with the benefit of the additional capital provided by premier s participation in the tarp capital purchase program and the requirement to record the non performing assets at their estimated fair value at acquisition date  management believes it will be successful in resolving a majority of the non performing assets acquired from abigail adams

management s discussion and analysis december  the loan summary table presents five years of comparative non performing asset information 
other than these loans and the impaired loans discussed in 
note to the consolidated financial statements  premier does not have a significant volume of loans where management has serious doubts about the borrowers ability to comply with the present repayment terms of the loan 
it is premier policy to place loans that are past due over days on non accrual status  unless the loans are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
primarily through its acquisition of abigail adams  premier now has million of construction loans on non accrual status at december  whereby additional funds may be needed by the borrower to complete the project 
for real estate loans  upon repossession  the balance of the loan is transferred to other real estate owned oreo and carried at the lower of the outstanding loan balance or the fair value of the property based on current appraisals and other current market trends  less estimated disposal costs 
if a writedown of the oreo property is necessary at the time of foreclosure  the amount is charged against the allowance for loan losses 
a periodic review of the recorded property value is performed in conjunction with normal loan reviews  and if market conditions indicate that the recorded value exceeds the fair market value less estimated disposal costs  additional writedowns of the property value are charged directly to operations 
during  premier recorded  of gains on the disposition of oreo properties  net of writedowns  compared to  of writedowns and losses on the disposition of oreo properties  net of gains in the net gains realized in are largely due to sales of oreo properties acquired via the abigail adams acquisition 
real estate values in and around washington  dc improved in compared to furthermore  premier spent funds on repairing or completing certain oreo properties prior to their sale  improving the properties salability and market value 
in  premier recorded  of writedowns and losses on the disposition of oreo properties  net of gains  compared to  of such writedowns and losses in the significant increase in oreo writedowns and losses in primarily relates to properties held at the newly acquired traders bank 
carrying values of oreo properties were compared to updated appraisals and additional writedowns of the property value were charged directly to operations based upon the updated net realizable value 
the properties were primarily undeveloped vacant land 
although loans may be classified as non performing  some continue to pay interest irregularly or at less than originally contracted terms 
during  approximately  of interest was recognized on non accrual and restructured loans  while approximately million would have been recognized in accordance with their original terms 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb probable incurred losses associated with lending activities 
actual losses are charged against the allowance charge offs while collections on loans previously charged off recoveries are added back to the allowance 
since actual losses within a given loan portfolio are difficult to predict  management uses a significant amount of estimation and judgment to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
factors considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance 
table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  include an individual assessment of risk on certain loans and total creditor relationships  historical charge off experience  the type of loan  levels of non performing and past due loans  and an evaluation of current economic conditions 
loans are evaluated for credit risk and assigned a risk grade 
premier risk grading criteria are based upon federal reserve guidelines and definitions 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  loans that are assigned passing grades are grouped together and multiplied by historical charge off percentages to determine an estimated amount of potential losses and a corresponding amount of allowance 
loans that are assigned marginally passing grades are grouped together and allocated slightly higher percentages to determine the estimated amount of potential losses due to the identification of increased risk s 
loans that are assigned a grade of substandard or doubtful are usually determined to be impaired 
the resulting estimate of losses for groups of loans is adjusted for relevant environmental factors and other conditions of the portfolio of loans  including borrower and industry concentrations  levels and trends in delinquencies  charge offs and recoveries  changes in underwriting standards and risk selection  level of experience  ability and depth of lending management  and national and local economic conditions 
a loan is categorized and reported as impaired when it is probable that the borrower will be unable to pay all of the principal and interest amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
in determining whether a loan is impaired  management considers such factors as past payment history  recent economic events  current and projected financial conditions and other relevant information that is available at the time 
impairment is evaluated in total for smaller balance loans of similar nature such as residential mortgage  consumer  and credit card loans  and on an individual basis for other loans 
if a loan is deemed to be impaired  an evaluation of the amount of estimated loss is performed assessing the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan existing rate or assessing the fair and realizable value of the loan collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
the estimation of loss is assigned to the impaired loan and is used in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
for impaired loans  this estimation of loss is reevaluated quarterly and  if necessary  adjusted based upon the current known facts and circumstances related to the loan and the borrower 
additional information on premier impaired loans is contained in 
note to the consolidated financial statements 
the sum of the calculations and estimations of the risk of loss in the loan portfolio is compared to the recorded balance of the allowance for loan losses 
if the total allowance is deemed to be inadequate  a charge to earnings is recorded to increase the allowance 
in  premier recorded  of additional provisions for loan losses compared to  of additional provisions for loan losses in and  of additional provisions for loan losses in conversely  should an evaluation of the allowance result in a lower estimate of the risk of loss in the loan portfolio and the allowance is deemed to be more than adequate  a reversal of previous charges to earnings a negative provision may be warranted in the current period 
events that may lead to negative provisions include greater than anticipated recoveries  a reduction in the historical loss ratios  securing more collateral on an impaired loan during the collection process  or receiving payment in full on an impaired loan

management s discussion and analysis december  at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total year end loans  compared to an allowance for loan losses of million  or of total loans at december  the increase in the ratio of the allowance to total loans in was the result of million of additional provisions for loan losses exceeding the million of net charge offs 
the additional provisions for loan losses recorded in were largely due to million of provisions recorded at adams national and cb t as loans were reanalyzed for impairment through out the year 
the remaining banks recorded a collective provision for loan losses of million in  which is similar to the provision recorded by these banks in at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total year end loans  compared to an allowance for loan losses of million  or of total loans at december  the significant decrease in the ratio of allowance to total loans was directly the result of adding the million of loans from the acquisition of abigail adams without adding any allowance for loan losses 
new accounting guidance adopted by premier at the beginning of does not permit an acquirer to carryover the purchased entity s allowance for loan losses 
instead  under the new accounting guidance  all acquired loans are to be recorded at their net estimated fair value 
the estimate of fair value included factors for the measurement of credit risk  interest rate risk and re salability in the most advantageous market for the loans in an orderly transaction between market participants 
these estimates required management most difficult  subjective and complex judgments and are inherently uncertain 
however  since the estimated fair value of these loans were believed to have accounted for the reasonably estimable credit risk in the loans  no allowance for loan losses for these loans was recorded at the date of acquisition 
at september   just prior to premier s acquisition  abigail adams reported a collective allowance for loan losses of approximately million 
in contrast  premier recorded the estimated fair value of the combined loan portfolios at an estimated million discount to the contractual amounts receivable on the loans at acquisition 
these discounts  allocated per loan  will be used to offset any charge offs of the uncollectible portion of the contractual amount due on non performing assets  or accreted into interest income using a level yield method on performing loans 
should premier collect the full contractual amount due  any fair value discount would be recognized as interest income 
excluding the loans acquired from abigail adams  the remaining allowance for loan losses was of total year end loans 
the decrease in the ratio is largely due to the charge off of loans to one borrower that had been identified and carried as an impaired loan for more than three years 
premier finally received permission from the bankruptcy court to foreclose upon and liquidate the collateral 
the actual charge off was approximately the amount of allowance allocated to the loan during its classification as an impaired loan 
the allowance for loan losses was also reduced by the million of net charge offs in which was only partially offset by the million of additional provisions for loan losses during the year 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total year end loans 
while the total allowance increased by million from the million allowance at the end of  the ratio to total loans decreased slightly from the of total year end loans at december  the increase in the allowance in is largely due to the million allowance for loan losses acquired via the purchase of traders and citizens first banks  as 
table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  permitted by the accounting guidance in place in the slight decrease in the ratio to total year end loans is largely the result of lower estimates of required allocations of the allowance to impaired loans due to a combination of collections of previously impaired loans and improved loan to collateral values on existing impaired loans 
the allowance for loan losses was also reduced by the  of net charge offs in which was only partially offset by the  of additional provisions for loan losses during the year 
the summary of the allowance for loan losses allocated by loan type is presented in the loan summary table above 
the following table provides a more detailed history of the allowance for loan losses  illustrating charge offs and recoveries by loan type  and the annual provision for loan losses over the past five years 
since  the deterioration in the national economy and its impact on the local economy in its markets has resulted in increases in past due loans and non performing assets for premier 
as such  management s estimate of the current estimated risk of loss in the existing loan portfolio began to increase in the second quarter of and provisions for loan losses were charged to earnings in the second  third and fourth quarters which more than offset a negative provision for losses in the first quarter 
as the deterioration in the national economy and its impact on premier s local economies continued in and  some of the increases in past due loans and non performing assets in prior years became charged off loans in and additional provisions for loan losses were recorded in as the estimated credit risk in the remaining loan portfolio was evaluated 
the level of additional provisions increased in to provide for estimated loan impairment primarily as additional loans at adams national were downgraded and analyzed for impairment 
as noted in the non performing asset discussion above  excluding the impact of the acquisition of the non performing loans of abigail adams  in premier s remaining banks experienced a slight increase in non accrual loans and decreases in the loans carried as days past due or in oreo  indicating similar credit risk in the portfolio at the end of as compared to the end of premier aggressively pursues past due loans in an effort to bring those loans back to current status 
if these efforts fail and a past due loan becomes a non performing loan  premier s policies for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses are used to determine the estimated potential loss on the loan 
future provisions to the allowance for loan losses  positive or negative  will depend on future improvement or deterioration in estimated credit risk in the loan portfolio as well as whether additional payments are received on loans having significant credit risk 
premier continually evaluates the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses  and changes in the provision are based on the estimated probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio

the recoveries at farmers deposit bank are primarily the result of continued collection efforts of the significant number and amount of loans charged off at farmers deposit bank in through approximately  or of the net charge offs and million  or of the premier s net charge offs were at farmers deposit bank 
the level of future recoveries is likely to decrease as the level of past charge offs has decreased 
in  total charge offs decreased by million to million  or of average total loans  as premier realized reduced levels of charge offs in commercial  consumer and real estate secured loans 
total charge offs on the loans acquired from abigail adams amounted to  in and were substantially offset by  of recoveries on loans during the year 
while risk still exists that the national economic struggles will negatively affect premier s borrowers  in premier successfully pursued collateral repossessions to minimize its level of charge offs 
in  total charge offs increased to million as the national economic downturn negatively affected some commercial borrowers ability to service their loans from premier 
charge offs of commercial loans and loans secured by commercial real estate totaled million or approximately of the total charge offs recorded in  the highest level recorded over the past five years 
consumer charge offs increased by  even with the increases  net charge offs were still only of average outstanding loans in in  total charge offs increased for the first time in the previous four years 
however  net charge offs still constituted a relatively low of average total loans 
in  charge offs on commercial and real estate loans increased while consumer loan charge offs decreased to their lowest dollar volume over the past five years 
although management believes it has identified the significant remaining credit risk in the loan portfolio  additional charge offs may be recorded in the coming months due to the level of non performing loans and the resolution of collection efforts on those loans 
premier continues to make a significant effort to reduce its past due and non performing loans by reviewing loan files  using the courts to bring borrowers current with the terms of their loan agreements and or the foreclosure and sale of oreo properties 
as in the past  when these plans are executed  premier may experience increases in non performing loans and non performing assets 
furthermore  any resulting increases in loans placed on non accrual status will have a negative impact on future loan interest income 
also  as these plans are executed  other loans may be identified that would

premier continues to monitor and evaluate the impact that national housing market price declines may have on its local markets and collateral valuations as management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
while some price deterioration is expected  it is not currently anticipated that premier s markets will be impacted as severely as other areas of the country due to the historically modest increases in real estate values in the company s markets in west virginia  ohio and kentucky 
with the concentrations of commercial real estate loans acquired in the washington  dc and richmond  virginia markets  fluctuations in commercial real estate value will also be monitored 
in  premier sold some oreo properties at a gain  which may indicate stabilization in commercial real estate values

during  as loan payments and payoffs exceeded the demand for new loans  some of the proceeds from the loan payments were invested in investment securities 
investment securities are highly liquid and generally have a greater yield than interest bearing bank balances or federal funds sold 
however their longer investment term generally results in greater interest rate risk over other short term investments 
this was believed to be especially true in  as management anticipated market interest rates to be at their lowest level and that buying longer term investments would have the effect of locking in these lowest interest rates over the life of the investments 
due to the low interest rate environment during  issuers of investment securities were routinely invoking call features within their securities and reissuing new bonds at lower coupon rates 
during  million of premier s investment securities were either called or matured  compared to million during and only million during to offset some of the effects of interest rate risk in the investment portfolio  premier began purchased collateralized mortgage obligations cmo s issued by the government national mortgage association gnma  also known as ginnie mae 
these cmo s are similar to us treasury bonds in that they are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government  but unlike us treasury bonds  return a portion of the principal each month coinciding with the monthly principal payments made by mortgage borrowers collateralizing the securities 
it is the monthly return of principal that will allow premier to take advantage of any rise in market interest rates by investing the principal payments in the future higher yielding securities long before the final maturity date of the cmo

during and continuing into  customers seemed to resign themselves to the long term nature of the low interest rate environment resulting from the federal reserve s national monetary policy and moved funds temporarily held in transaction based deposit accounts back into certificates of deposit to gain some yield over other deposit products 
most customers are still keeping their maturity choices short in order to take advantage of possible higher interest rates in the future 
while offering some special certificate of deposit rates in and to remain competitive  premier continued to focus on building its base of customer relationships by offering more convenient electronic banking products to its non interest bearing deposit customers 
in order to help maintain their liquidity and reduce their reliance on short term borrowings  prior to their acquisition by premier the two subsidiary banks of abigail adams participated in a network of approved banks that exchange customer certificates of deposit called the certificate of deposit account registry service program  also known as cdars 
this program allows local customers to open certificates of deposit in amounts greater than the standard fdic insurance coverage limits at their local bank and still maintain fdic insurance coverage on the deposits as the local bank enters the certificates of deposit into a national exchange network which provides fdic insurance coverage by opening accounts in the customer s name at other participating banks in the network in increments less than the standard fdic coverage limits 
other network members do the same thing with their customers funds  and a sophisticated matching system enables network members to exchange funds with each other on a dollar for dollar basis 
to participate in the program  banks subject to a written agreement with their primary regulator  such as adams national  are required to get permission from the fdic 
during  even though adams national was a participant in the network and currently had deposits from the cdars network  the bank was denied permission by the fdic to continue to open new or renew existing cdars deposits while it is

management s discussion and analysis december  subject to its written agreement with the occ  its primary regulator 
during  as the cdars deposits matured  adams national was able to retain more than of the maturing cdars as certificates of deposit with adams national and no longer part of the cdars network 
under long existing fdic rules for banks owned by the same holding company under common control  such as each of premier s affiliate banks  each bank under common control is obligated to guarantee the liquidity of deposit funds over and above the fdic coverage limits at each of the other banks under the same common control 
in other words  each of premier s affiliate banks are obligated to provide liquidity for each of the other premier affiliate banks to the extent it may be needed for deposit withdrawals 
premier believes that knowledge of this guarantee resulted in holders of some of the maturing cdars related deposits at adams national to renew their certificate of deposit at adams national outside of the cdars program

management s discussion and analysis december  asset liability management and market risk asset liability management is a means of maximizing net interest income while minimizing interest rate risk by planning and controlling the mix and maturities of interest related assets and liabilities 
premier has established an asset liability management committee alco for the purpose of monitoring and managing interest rate risk and to evaluate investment portfolio strategies 
interest rate risk is the earnings variation that could occur due to changes in market interest rates 
the board of directors has established policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
premier monitors its interest rate risk through the use of an earnings simulation model developed by an independent third party to analyze net interest income sensitivity 
the earnings simulation model uses assumptions  maturity patterns  and reinvestment rates provided by premier and forecasts the effect of instantaneous movements in interest rates of both and basis points  but never below zero 
the most recent earnings simulation model projects that net interest income would increase by approximately over the projected stable rate net interest income if interest rates rise by basis points over the next year 
conversely  the simulation projects an approximate decrease in net interest income if interest rates fall by basis points over the next year 
within the same time frame  but assuming a basis point movement in interest rates  the simulation projects that net interest income would increase by over the projected stable rate net interest income in a rising rate scenario and would decrease by in a falling rate scenario 
under both the and basis point simulations  the percentage changes in net interest income are within premier alco guidelines 
the model simulation calculations of present value have certain acceptable shortcomings 
the discount rates and prepayment assumptions utilized are based on estimated market interest rate levels for similar loans and securities nationwide 
the unique characteristics of premier loans and securities may not necessarily parallel those assumed in the model simulations  and therefore  actual results could likely result in different discount rates  prepayment experiences and present values 
the discount rates used for deposits and borrowings are based upon available alternative types and sources of funds which may not necessarily be indicative of the present value of premier deposits and borrowings 
premier deposits have customer relationship advantages that are difficult to simulate 
a higher or lower interest rate environment will most likely result in different investment and borrowing strategies by premier which would be designed to further mitigate any negative effects on the value of  and the net interest earnings generated on premier net assets

premier liquidity is based on the stable nature of consumer core deposits held by the banking subsidiaries 
likewise  additional liquidity is available from holdings of investment securities and short term investments which can be readily converted into cash 
furthermore  premier banks continue to have the ability to attract short term sources of funds such as federal funds and repurchase agreements 
premier generated million of cash from operations in  which compares to million in and million in as illustrated in the consolidated statement of cash flows  the increase in cash from operations was the result of an increase in net income generated by operations  excluding the gain on the acquisition of subsidiary in  and changes in deferred taxes  other assets and other liabilities 
the decrease in from the cash from operations generated in was primarily the result of non cash generating income from the gain on the acquisition of subsidiary and changes in other assets and liabilities

details on the sources and uses of cash can be found in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the consolidated financial statements

capital resources premier s consolidated average equity to asset ratio decreased to during  down from during and in the ratios for all three years are considered adequate for a company of premier s size 
the decrease in was largely due to the full year impact of the average assets from the abigail adams acquisition in and the partial year increase in average assets from the branch acquisition 
the branch acquisition was a cash purchase which added no additional direct equity to the company 
equity was strengthened in by additional capital from the million of retained net income generated during the year 

table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  this increase in equity was partially offset by diminished equity resulting from a decrease in the market value of investments from a million net unrealized gain at the end of to a million net unrealized loss at the end of the increase in was largely due to the additional equity added from the sale of series a preferred stock to the us treasury under the tarp capital purchase program 
without this additional equity  premier s average equity to asset ratio would have still have been  down from prior years due to the acquisition of abigail adams  but strengthened by additional capital from the million of retained net income generated in also adding to capital in was a general rise in the market value of investments from a million net unrealized gain at the end of to a million net unrealized gain at the end of the federal reserve risk based capital guidelines and leverage ratio measure the capital adequacy of banking institutions 
the risk based capital guidelines weight balance sheet assets and off balance sheet commitments by prescribed factors relative to credit risk  thus eliminating disincentives for holding low risk assets and requiring more capital for holding higher risk assets 
at year end  premier s capital to risk adjusted assets ratio was  compared to at december  and at december  all three of these ratios are well above the minimum level of prescribed for bank holding companies of premier s size 
the leverage ratio is a measure of total tangible equity to total tangible assets  net of any related deferred taxes as permitted 
premier s leverage ratio at december  was compared to at december  and at december  all three of these ratios are above the to ratios recommended by the federal reserve 
the decrease in the leverage ratio was largely the result of the additional tangible assets from the branch purchase combined with a reduction in tangible equity resulting from the goodwill and core deposit intangible recorded as part of the branch purchase 
the increase in the capital to risk adjusted assets ratio in is largely the result of a minimal increase in risk adjusted assets as premier increased its holdings of less riskier liquid assets and kept more of those liquid assets in interest bearing deposit accounts with the federal reserve which are given a zero percent risk factor 
also minimizing the increase in risk adjusted assets in was the purchase of million of additional zero percent risk factor investment securities such as gnma backed cmo s 
the increase in the leverage ratio was largely the result of the additional regulatory capital obtained via the sale of series a preferred stock to the us treasury under the tarp capital purchase program 
the decrease in the risk adjusted capital to assets ratio is largely the result of a higher level of risk adjusted assets to total assets acquired from abigail adams versus premier s historical risk adjusted assets to total assets 
premier capital ratios are the direct result of management desire to maintain a strong capital position

new accounting guidance  adopted by premier at the beginning of  changed the way negative goodwill is calculated and recorded on the books of an acquiring organization 
prior to  negative goodwill resulted when the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the purchase price paid for a subsidiary 
this negative goodwill was recorded on the balance sheet and accreted into income over a designated period of time 
under current accounting guidance  negative goodwill is no longer recorded on the balance sheet and any negative difference in fair value of the net assets acquired versus the purchase price paid for those net assets is immediately recognized in non interest income 
also  prior to  the purchase price paid for a subsidiary involving an exchange of the company s stock was determined using the company s stock price on the day prior to public announcement of the acquisition agreement 
under current accounting guidance  the purchase price paid is determined using the stock price on the day prior to the effective date of the acquisition 
since the consideration paid by premier to the shareholders of abigail adams was a fixed exchange ratio of its common stock  several factors contributed to premier realizing a gain on the acquisition  including but not limited to a decrease in the calculation of the purchase price paid by premier due to a decline in premier s stock price from the date the fixed exchange ratio was agreed upon to the day before the effective date of the acquisition  increases in the fair value of the investment portfolio acquired  improvements in the credit quality of some of the loans acquired  and a decrease in the fair value of fixed rate certificates of deposit acquired due to declining market interest rates

excluding the gain from pretax income in would result in an effective tax rate of approximately 
the increase in this effective tax rate when compared to the realized in is largely due to non deductible expenses associated with the acquisition of abigail adams 
the lower effective tax rate in is largely due to the recognition of a  net of federal income tax expense  west virginia income tax benefit resulting from premier s projected ability to fully realize its west virginia state deferred tax assets 
the majority of the state deferred tax assets are made up of west virginia net operating loss carryforwards  some of which were incurred as a result of premier s historical operations and some of which were obtained from the traders bankshares acquisition in the projection takes into account changes in west virginia s corporation income tax rules regarding consolidated income tax returns and the likelihood that the projected taxable income from the acquired banks will accelerate the utilization of all carryforwards

effects of changing prices the results of operations and financial condition presented in this report are based on historical cost  unadjusted for the effects of inflation 
inflation affects premier in two ways 
one effect is that inflation can result in increased operating costs which must be absorbed or recovered through increased prices for services 
the second effect is on the purchasing power of the corporation 
virtually all of a bank assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
regardless of changes in prices  most assets and liabilities of the banking subsidiaries will be converted into a fixed number of dollars 
non earning assets  such as premises and equipment  do not comprise a major portion of premier assets  therefore  most assets are subject to repricing on a more frequent basis than in other industries 
premier ability to offset the effects of inflation and potential reductions in future purchasing power depends primarily on its ability to maintain capital levels by adjusting prices for its services and to improve net interest income by maintaining an effective asset liability mix 
management efforts to meet these goals are described in other sections of this report
