the following discussion shou ld be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements of taubman centers  inc and the notes thereto 
general background and performance measurement taubman centers  inc tco is a michigan corporation that operates as a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust reit 
the taubman realty group limited partnership the operating partnership or trg is a majority owned partnership subsidiary of tco  which owns direct or indirect interests in all of our real estate properties 
in this report  the terms we  us  and our refer to tco  the operating partnership  and or the operating partnership subsidiaries as the context may require 
we own  manage  lease  acquire  dispose of  develop  and expand regional and super regional shopping centers 
the consolidated businesses consist of shopping centers and entities that are controlled by ownership or contractual agreements  the taubman company llc manager  and taubman properties asia llc and its subsidiarie s taubman asia 
shopping centers owned through joint ventures that are not controlled by us but over which we have significant influence unconsolidated joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method 
references in this discussion to beneficial interest refer to our ownership or pro rata share of the item being discussed 
also  the operations of the shopping centers are often best understood by measuring their performance as a whole  without regard to our ownership interest 
consequently  in addition to the discussion of the operations of the consolidated businesses  the operations of the unconsolidated joint ventures are presented and discussed as a whole 
all operating statistics provided exclude the pier shops 
in addition  and statistics also exclude regency square 
see results of operations the pier shops at caesars  and results of operations regency square 
overall summary of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our primary source of revenue is from the leasing of space in our shopping centers 
generally these leases are long term  with our average lease term of new leases at approximately seven years during and approximately six years during  excluding temporary leases 
therefore general economic trends most directly impact our tenants sales and consequently their ability to perform under their existing lease agreements and expand into new locations as well as our ability to find new tenants for our shopping centers 
we have begun to see positive signs of stabilization in the economy and capital markets although the impacts of the recent recession continue 
during  only of tenants sought the protection of the bankruptcy laws  compared to and of tenants in and  respectively 
we believe this is indicative of the improved health of retailers as well as the proactive way landlords worked with retailers in trouble last year so that they could stay open  effectively helping them restructure outside of bankruptcy 
the retail environment has shown improvement and retailers are becoming more optimistic with their expansion plans and capital allocation decisions 
however  retailers are still sensitive to occupancy costs and negotiations continue to be challenging 

table of contents our mall tenant sales per square foot statistics have shown strong improvement in tenant sales per square foot were in  a increase from  and higher than we have ever reported 
we are expecting tenant sales per square foot to be up to in see mall tenant sales and center revenues 
ending occupancy was at december   up from we anticipate year end occupancy will be up about in but may see a modest decrease early in the year 
rent per square foot increased for the fourth quarter of and was down for the year 
we expect that average rents per square foot in will be up in comparison to by approximately 
the rents we are able to achieve are affected by economic trends and tenants expectations thereof  as described under rental rates and occupancy 
the spread between rents on openings and closings may not be indicative of future periods  as this statistic is not computed on comparable tenant spaces  and can vary significantly from period to period depending on the total amount  location  and average size of tenant space opening and clos ing in the period 
mall tenant sales  occupancy levels  and our resulting revenues are seasonal in nature see seasonality 
our analysis of our financial results begins under results of operations 
in september  our board of directors made the decision to discontinue financial support of regency square 
in  we also discontinued financial support of the pier shops and the loan on this property is in default 
impairment charges were recognized on regency square and the pier shops in see results of operations regency square and results of operations the pier shop at caesars for further discussion and the status of the regency square and pier shops loans 
in  we also recorded impairment charges related to our oyster bay project and our sarasota project 
see results of operations oyster bay and results of operations sarasota 
we have begun to see signs of an economic recovery and have seen some improvement in our center operations in see results of operations center operations 
we have certain additional sources of income beyond our rental revenues  recoveries from tenants  and revenue from management  leasing  and development services 
we disclose our share of these sources of income under results of operations other income 
we have been very active in managing our balance sheet  completing refinancings of macarthur center  arizona mills  and the mall at partridge creek in as outlined under results of operations debt transactions 
we also describe the current status of our efforts to broaden our growth in asia 
see results of operations taubman asia 
with all the preceding information as background  we then provide insight and explanations for variances in our financial results for   and under comparison of to and comparison of to as information useful to understanding our results  we have described the reasons for our use of non gaap measures such as beneficial interests in ebitda and funds from operations ffo under results of operations use of non gaap measures 
reconciliations from net income loss and net income loss allocable to common shareowners to these measures follow the annual comparisons 
we then provide a discussion of our critical accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements that will affect periods subsequent to our discussion of sources and uses of capital resources under liquidity and capital resources begins with a brief overview of current market conditions and our financial position as of december  in january  the international plaza loan matured and was extended  and two additional loans mature in the million fair oaks loan  million at our share  matures in april the million regency square loan matures in november but we have notified the lender of our intent not to continue support of the center including not repaying the loan 
in february  our million line of credit was extended to february our million line was extended in december to february we then discuss our capital activities and transactions that occurred in analysis of specific operating  investing  and financing activities is then provided in more detail 

table of contents specific analysis of our fixed and floating rates and periods of interest rate risk exposure is provided under liquidity and capital resources beneficial interest in debt 
completing our analysis of our exposure to rates are the effects of changes in interest rates on our cash flows and fair values of debt contained under liquidity and capital resources sensitivity analysis 
also see liquidity and capital resources loan commitments and guarantees for discussion of compliance with debt covenants 
in conducting our business  we enter into various contractual obligations  including those for debt  capital leases for property improvements  operating leases for land and office space  purchase obligations  and other long term commitments 
detail of these obligations  including expected settlement periods  is contained under liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations 
property level debt represents the largest single class of obligations 
described under liquidity and capital resources loan commitments and guarantees and liquidity and capital resources cash tender agreement are our significant guarantees and commitments 
renovation and expansion of existing malls has been a significant use of our capital in recent years  as described in liquidity and capital resources capital spending and liquidity and capital resources capital spending planned capital spending 
our city creek center project  which we will own under a participating lease  is expected to open in march at which time a million payment will be made to the lessor 
we expect capital spending in to consist primarily of tenant allowances  renovations and expansions at our operating centers  including projects at short hills and willow bend 
in the fourth quarter of  we formed a joint venture to seek development sites for outlet shopping centers 
dividends and distributions are also significant uses of our capital resources 
the factors considered when determining the amount of our dividends  including requirements arising because of our status as a reit  are described under liquidity and capital resources dividends 
mall tenant sales and center revenues our mall tenant sales per square foot statistics have shown improvement since july and in the fourth quarter of increased by compared to the corresponding period in the prior year 
for all of  our tenant sales increased to a record level of per square foot 
over the long term  the level of mall tenant sales is the single most important determinant of revenues of the shopping centers because mall tenants provide approximately of these revenues and mall tenant sales determine the amount of rent  percentage rent  and recoverable expenses together  total occupancy costs that mall tenants can afford to pay 
however  levels of mall tenant sales can be considerably more volatile in the short run than total occupancy costs  and may be impacted significantly  either positively or negatively  by the success or lack of success of a small number of tenants or even a single tenant 
we believe that the ability of tenants to pay occupancy costs and earn profits over long periods of time increases as sales per square foot increase  whether through inflation or real growth in customer spending 
because most mall tenants have certain fixed expenses  the occupancy costs that they can afford to pay and still be profitable are a higher percentage of sales at higher sales per square foot 
sales directly impact the amount of percentage rents certain tenants and anchors pay 
the effects of increases or declines in sales on our operations are moderated by the relatively minor share of total rents that percentage rents represent of total rents approximately in while tenant sales are critical over the long term  the high quality regional mall business has been a very stable business model with its diversity of income from thousands of tenants  its staggered lease maturities  and high proportion of fixed rent 
however  a sustained trend in sales does impact  either negatively or positively  our ability to lease vacancies and negotiate rents at advantageous rates 

table of contents the following table summarizes occupancy costs  excluding utilities  for mall tenants as a percentage of mall tenant sales mall tenant sales in thousands sales per square foot consolidated businesses minimum rents percentage rents expense recoveries mall tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of mall tenant sales unconsolidated joint ventures minimum rents percentage rents expense recoveries mall tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of mall tenant sales combined minimum rents percentage rents expense recoveries mall tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of mall tenant sales in  mall tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of mall tenant sales increased due primarily to the decrease in tenant sales 
in  the statistic decreased primarily due to the increase in tenant sales 
rental rates and occupancy as leases have expired in the centers  we have generally been able to rent the available space  either to the existing tenant or a new tenant  at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases 
generally  center revenues have increased as older leases rolled over or were terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current rental rates that were usually higher than the average rates for existing leases 
in periods of increasing sales as we are experiencing now  rents on new leases will generally tend to rise 
in periods of slower growth or declining sales  rents on new leases will grow more slowly or will decline for the opposite reason  as tenants expectations of future growth become less optimistic 
average rent per square foot in is expected to be up about

mall tenant leased space  ending occupancy  and average occupancy rates are as follows ending occupancy average occupancy leased space ending occupancy was  a increase from in at  leased space is over the year end occupancy level 
we expect occupancy in to end the year up about but we may see a modest decrease early in the year

tenant bankruptcy filings as a percentage of the total number of tenant leases was in  compared to in  and in 
table of contents seasonality the regional shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  with mall tenant sales highest in the fourth quarter due to the christmas season  and with lesser  though still significant  sales fluctuations associated with the easter holiday and back to school period 
while minimum rents and recoveries are generally not subject to seasonal factors  most leases are scheduled to expire in the first quarter  and the majority of new stores open in the second half of the year in anticipation of the christmas selling season 
additionally  most percentage rents are recorded in the fourth quarter 
accordingly  revenues and occupancy levels are generally highest in the fourth quarter 
gains on sales of peripheral land and lease cancellation income may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
total th quarter rd quarter nd quarter st quarter in thousands  except occupancy and leased space data mall tenant sales revenues and gains on land sales and other nonoperating income consolidated businesses unconsolidated joint ventures occupancy and leased space ending occupancy average occupancy leased space based on reports of sales furnished by mall tenants

table of contents results of operations in addition to the results and trends in our operations discussed in the preceding sections  the following sections discuss certain transactions that affected operations in the years ending   and  or are expected to affect operations in the future 
regency square in september  we concluded that the book value of the investment in regency square was impaired and as a result  the book value of the property was written down by million to a fair value of approximately million as of september  the decision was based on estimates of future cash flows for the property  which were negatively impacted by necessary capital expenditures and declining net operating income noi 
in september  our board of directors made the decision to discontinue financial support of regency square including not funding the non recourse mortgage debt that is due in november as a result  we have begun discussions with the lender about the center s future ownership 
we expect the non cash impact of owning regency square assuming default interest begins april to result in an earnings charge in of approximately million 
the impact excluding depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately million 
in addition  a significant non cash accounting gain  representing the difference between the book value of the debt  interest payable and other obligations extinguished over the net book value of the property and any other assets transferred  will be recognized when the loan obligation is extinguished upon transfer of title of regency square 
the process is not in our control and the timing of transfer of title is uncertain 
the book value of the investment in regency square as of december  was approximately million  which includes additional capital spending that was anticipated in determining the fair value in the pier shops at caesars in september  the book value of the pier shops was written down by million of which  our share was million to a fair value of approximately million 
our decision was based on the conclusion of our board of directors to discontinue financial support of the pier shops given long term prospects for the property  including that cash flows generated from the center were insufficient to cover debt service on the million non recourse loan 
as a result of our discontinuing payment of debt service  the loan is now in default 
under the terms of the loan agreement  interest accrues at the original stated rate of plus a default rate 
accrued interest and late fees total million as of december  including the impact of compounding default interest and late fees  the effective rate on the million loan balance is and  respectively  for the quarter and year ended december  although we are no longer funding any cash shortfalls  we continue to record the operations of the center and interest on the loan in our results until title for the center has been transferred and our obligation for the loan is extinguished 
in april  the holder of the loan on the pier shops filed a lawsuit to foreclose on the loan 
the foreclosure process is not in our control and the timing of transfer of title is uncertain 
we expect the non cash impact of owning the pier shops including default interest to result in an earnings charge in of approximately million 
the impact excluding depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately million 
these earnings impacts represent of the results of the pier shops 
in addition  a significant non cash accounting gain  representing the difference between the book value of the debt  interest payable and other obli gations extinguished over the net book value of the property and any other assets transferred  will be recognized when the loan obligation is extinguished upon transfer of title of the pier shops 
the book value of the investment in the pier shops as of december  was approximately million 
oyster bay in  we recognized an impairment charge to income of million for the oyster bay project  including million in costs  which were paid in  associated with obligations under existing contracts related to the project 
this determination was reached after an overall assessment of the probability of the development of the mall as designed as a result of the delay in obtaining a special use permit 
the charge included the costs of previous development activities as well as holding and other costs that management believes will likely not benefit the development if and when we obtain the rights to build the center 
we have been expensing costs relating to oyster bay since the fourth quarter of and will continue to do so until it is probable that we will be able to successfully move forward with a project 
our remaining capitalized investment in the project as of december  is million  which is classified in development pre construction costs see note properties oyster bay to our consolidated financial statements and consists of land and site improvements 
if we are ultimately unsuccessful in obtaining the right to build the center  it is uncertain whether we would be able to recover the full amount of this capitalized investment through alternate uses of the land 

table of contents sarasota in  we recognized an million charge to income relating to a project in sarasota  florida 
the charge to income represented our share of total project costs 
we have no asset remaining and continue to expense any additional costs related to the monitoring of the project 
see note investments in unconsolidated joint ventures university town center to our consolidated financial statements 
litigation charges in  we recognized litigation charges relating to the settlement of two lawsuits related to westfarms  our center in west hartford  connecticut 
the settlements included million settled in december and million settled in january  of which our share of the total settlements was million 
see note investments in unconsolidated joint ventures westfarms to our consolidated financial statements 
restructuring in  in response to the decreased level of active projects due to the downturn in the economy  we reduced our workforce by about positions  primarily in areas that directly or indirectly affect our development initiatives in the us and asia 
the restructuring charge was million  and primarily represents the cost of terminations of personnel 
center operations we saw improvement in the noi of our centers in the fourth quarter of  and ended the year up over  excluding lease cancellation income 
we expect that noi of our centers  excluding lease cancellation income  will be up in the range of to in we expect increased tenant rents resulting from higher average rent per square foot and improved occupancy 
we expect net recoveries to be modestly down however because of increases in utility costs  lower cam capital recoveries  and increased other expenses 
see results of operations use of non gaap measures for the definition and discussion of noi and see reconciliation of net income loss to noi 
other income we have certain additional sources of income beyond our rental revenues  recoveries from tenants  and revenues from management  leasing  and development services  as summarized in the following table 
lease cancellation revenue is primarily dependent on the overall economy and performance of particular retailers in specific locations and can vary significantly 
gains on peripheral land sales can also vary significantly from year to year  depending on the results of negotiations with potential purchasers of land  as well as the economy and the timing of the transactions 
during the year ended december   we recognized our approximately million share of lease cancellation revenue 
our largest collections occurred in the fourth quarter when we recorded the income from the closure of the saks fifth avenue store at willow be nd 
however  we do not expect this pace to continue  which could negatively impact our results in excluding two large payments in  our share of lease cancellation income would have been about million 
our share of lease cancellation income over the last six years ranged from million to this year s million 
in  we are estimating our share of lease cancellation income to be about million to million

in the fourth quarter of we recognized approximately million of development fees collected for services performed primarily prior to on the macao project 
presentation of operating results the following table contains the operating results of our consolidated businesses and the unconsolidated joint ventures 
on january   we adopted the new accounting for noncontrolling interests 
see note summary of significant accounting policies noncontrolling interests  to our consolidated financial statements 
our average ownership percentage of the operating partnership was in  and use of non gaap measures we use noi as an alternative measure to evaluate the operating performance of centers  both on individual and stabilized portfolio bases 
we define noi as property level operating revenues includes rental income excluding straightline adjustments of minimum rent less maintenance  taxes  utilities  ground rent including straightline adjustments  and other property operating expenses 
since noi excludes general and administrative expenses  pre development charges  interest income and expense  depreciation and amortization  impairment charges  restructuring charges  and gains from land and property dispositions  it provides a performance measure that  when compared period over period  reflects the revenues and expenses most directly associated with owning and operating rental properties  as well as the impact on their operations from trends in tenant sales  occupancy and rental rates  and operating costs 
we also use noi excluding lease cancellation income as an alternative measure because this income may vary significantly from period to period  which can affect comparability and trend analysis 
we generally provide separate projections for expected noi growth and our lease cancellation income 

table of contents the operating results in the following table include the supplemental earnings measures of beneficial interest in ebitda and funds from operations ffo 
beneficial interest in ebitda represents our share of the earnings before interest  income taxes  and depreciation and amortization of our consolidated and unconsolidated businesses 
we believe beneficial interest in ebitda provides a useful indicator of operating performance  as it is customary in the real estate and shopping center business to evaluate the performance of properties on a basis unaffected by capital structure 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from extraordinary items and sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we believe that ffo is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance for reits 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  we and most industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results that exclude historical cost depreciation to be useful in ev aluating the operating performance of reits 
we primarily use ffo in measuring operating performance and in formulating corporate goals and compensation 
we may also present adjusted versions of noi  beneficial interest in ebitda  and ffo when used by management to evaluate our operating performance when certain significant items have impacted our results that affect comparability with prior or future periods due to the nature or amounts of these items 
in  ffo was adjusted for impairment charges  a restructuring charge  and litigation charges 
in  ffo was adjusted for impairment charges 
ffo was not adjusted in our presentations of noi  beneficial interest in ebitda  ffo  and adjusted versions of these measures  are not necessarily comparable to the similarly titled measures of other reits due to the fact that not all reits use the same definitions 
these measures should not be considered alternatives to net income loss or as an indicator of our operating performance 
additionally  these measures do not represent cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as defined by gaap 
reconciliations of net income loss attributable to taubman centers  inc common shareowners to funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations  net income loss to beneficial interest in ebitda  and net income loss to net operating income loss are presented following new accounting pronouncements

table of contents application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the financial statements and disclosures 
some of these estimates and assumptions require application of difficult  subjective  and or complex judgment  often about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods 
we are required to make such estimates and assumptions when applying the following accounting policies 
valuation of shopping centers the viability of all projects under construction or development  including those owned by unconsolidated joint ventures  are regularly evaluated under applicable accounting requirements  including requirements relating to abandonment of assets or changes in use 
to the extent a project  or individual components of the project  are no longer considered to have value  the related capitalized costs are charged against operations 
additionally  all properties are reviewed for impairment on an individual basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment of a shopping center owned by consolidated entities is recognized when the sum of expected cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying value of the property 
other than temporary imp airment of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is recognized when the carrying value is not considered recoverable based on evaluation of the severity and duration of the decline in value  including the results of discounted cash flow and other valuation techniques 
the expected cash flows of a shopping center are dependent on estimates and other factors subject to change  including changes in the national  regional  and or local economic climates  competition from other shopping centers  stores  clubs  mailings  and the internet  increases in operating costs  bankruptcy and or other changes in the condition of third parties  including anchors and tenants  expected holding period  and availability of credit 
these factors could cause our expected future cash flows from a shopping center to change  and  as a result  an impairment could be considered to have occurred 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the excess carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value is charged to income 
no impairment charges were recognized in in  we recognized impairment charges of million and million related to the pier shops and regency square  respectively 
in  we recognized impairment charges of million and million related to our oyster bay and sarasota projects  respectively see results of operations 
as of december   the consolidated net book value of our properties was billion  representing over of our consolidated assets 
we also have varying ownership percentages in the properties of unconsolidated joint ventures with a total combined net book value of billion 
these amounts include certain development costs that are described in the policy that follows 
capitalization of development costs in developing shopping centers  we typically obtain land or land options  zoning and regulatory approvals  anchor commitments  and financing arrangements during a process that may take several years and during which we may incur significant costs 
we capitalize all development costs once it is considered probable that a project will reach a successful conclusion 
prior to this time  we expense all costs relating to a potential development  including payroll  and include these costs in funds from operations see results of operations use of non gaap measures 
on an ongoing basis  we continue to assess the probability of a project going forward and whether the asset is impaired 
in addition  we also assess whether there are sufficient substantive development activities in a given period to support the capitalization of carrying costs  including interest capitalization 
many factors in the development of a shopping center are beyond our control  including changes in the national  regional  and or local economic climates  competition from other shopping centers  stores  clubs  mailings  and the internet  availability and cost of financing  changes in regulations  laws  and zoning  and decisions made by third parties  including anchors 
these factors could cause our assessment of the probability of a development project reaching a successful conclusion to change 
if a project subsequently was considered less than probable of reaching a successful conclusion  a charge against operations for previously capitalized development costs would occur 
our million balance of development pre construction costs as of december  consists primarily of million of land and site improvements relating to our oyster bay project 
the balance also includes land for future development in atlanta  georgia 
see results of operations oyster bay regarding the status of the oyster bay project 

table of contents valuation of accounts and notes receivable rents and expense recoveries from tenants are our principal source of income  they represent approximately of our revenues 
in generating this income  we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants 
the collectibility of tenant receivables is affected by bankruptcies  changes in the economy  and the ability of the tenants to perform under the terms of their lease agreements 
while we estimate potentially uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income  actual experience may differ from those estimates 
also  if a tenant were not able to perform under the terms of its lease agreement  receivable balances not previously provided for may be required to be charged against operations 
bad debt expense was less than of total revenues in  while bankruptcy filings affected of tenan t leases during the year 
since  the annual provision for losses on accounts receivable has been less than of annual revenues 
notes receivable at december  totaled million 
valuation of the recoverability of notes receivable is dependent on management s estimates of the collectibility of contractual principal and interest payments  which are inherently judgmental 
valuation of deferred tax assets we currently have deferred tax assets  reflecting the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the bases of such assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws 
our temporary differences primarily relate to deferred compensation  net operating loss carryforwards and depreciation 
we reduce our deferred tax assets through valuation allowances to the amount where realization is more likely than not assured  considering all available evidence  including expected future taxable earnings 
expected future taxable earnings require certain significant judgments and estimates  including those relating to our management company profitability  the timing and amounts of gains on land sales  the profitability of our asian operations  the profitability of the unitary filing group for the michigan business tax  and other factors affecting the results of operations of our taxable reit subsidiaries 
changes in any of these factors could cause our estimates of the realization of deferred tax assets to change materially 
we also have michigan business income tax and modified gross receipts tax  which are subject to the accounting requirements for income taxes 
as of december   we had a net federal  state and foreign deferred tax asset of million  after a valuation allowance of million 
valuations for acquired property and intangibles upon acquisition of an investment property  including that of an additional interest in an asset already partially owned unless it was already consolidated  we make an assessment of the valuation and composition of assets and liabilities acquired 
these assessments consider fair values of the respective assets and liabilities and are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount and capitalization rates and other commonly accepted valuation techniques 
the estimated future cash flows that are used for this analysis reflect the historical operations of the property  known trends and changes expected in current market and economic conditions which would impact the property s operations  and our plans for such property 
these estimates of cash flows and valuations are particularly important for the recording of the acquisition at fair value  and allocation of purchase price between land  building and improvements  and other identifiable intangibles

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our internally generated funds and distributions from operating centers and other investing activities  augmented by use of our existing lines of credit  provide resources to maintain our current operations and assets and pay dividends 
generally  our need to access the capital markets is limited to refinancing debt obligations at maturity and funding major capital investments 
see capital spending for more details 
market conditions may limit our sources of funds for these financing activities and our ability to refinance our debt obligations at present principal amounts  interest rates  and other terms 
we are financed with property specific secured debt and we have two unencumbered center properties willow bend and stamford  a owned unconsolidated joint venture property 
the three loans that matured in were refinanced at higher principal amounts than the previous loan balances

we funded our million beneficial share of the paydown with funds from our revolving lines of credit 
the principal on the loan is now million at  and million at our beneficial share 
the rate on the loan had been fixed at due to an interest rate swap that also matured in january 
the loan has now reverted to a floating rate at libor plus 
the extended loan is prepayable at any time and has an additional one year extension option 
the million fair oaks loan  million at our beneficial share  matures in april and has two one year extension options 
currently the loan is fixed at due to an interest rate swap that also matures in april 
notice has been given to the lender to exercise the option to extend the maturity to april when the loan is extended  the loan will revert to a floating rate at libor plus 
however the loan is prepayable  and we believe we can fully refinance the principal balance  if we choose to do so 
the million regency square loan matures in november in september  our board of directors concluded that it was in our best interest to discontinue financial support of regency square 
we have begun discussions with the lender regarding the transfer of ownership of this property 
a default on this loan will not trigger any cross defaults on our other indebtedness 
the loan was not in default as of december  we will continue to accrue the results of the center until the ownership of regency square is transferred in satisfaction of the obligations under the debt 
however  we are not obligated to fund cash shortfalls of the center see results of operations regency square 
summaries of capital activities and transactions as of december   we had a consolidated cash balance of million

considering the facilities as adjusted  million would have been available as of december  twelve banks participate in our million line of credit and the failure of one bank to fund a draw on our line does not negate the obligation of the other banks to fund their pro rata shares 
our million loan at the pier shops is currently in default

sensitivity analysis we have exposure to interest rate risk on our debt obligations and interest rate instruments 
we use derivative instruments primarily to manage exposure to interest rate risks inherent in variable rate debt and refinancings 
we routinely use cap  swap  and treasury lock agreements to meet these objectives 
based on the operating partnership beneficial interest in floating rate debt in effect at december   a one percent increase or decrease in interest rates on this floating rate debt would decrease or increase cash flows and annual earnings by approximately million  respectively 
based on our consolidated debt and interest rates in effect at december   a one percent increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of debt by approximately million  while a one pe rcent decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of debt by approximately million

dividends we pay regular quarterly dividends to our common and preferred shareowners 
dividends to our common shareowners are at the discretion of the board of directors and depend on the cash available to us  our financial condition  capital and other requirements  and such other factors as the board of directors deems relevant 
to qualify as a reit  we must distribute at least of our reit taxable income prior to net capital gains to our shareowners  as well as meet certain other requirements 
we must pay these distributions in the taxable year the income is recognized  or in the following taxable year if they are declared during the last three months of the taxable year  payable to shareowners of record on a specified date during such period and paid during january of the following year 
such distributions are treated as paid by us and received by our shareowners on december of the year in which they are declared 
in addition  at our election  a distribution for a taxable year may be declared in the following taxable year if it is declared before we timely file our tax return for such year and if paid on or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration 
these distributions qualify as dividends paid for the reit distribution test for the previous year and are taxable to holders of our capital stock in the year in which paid 
preferred dividends accrue regardless of whether earnings  cash availability  or contractual obligations were to prohibit the current payment of dividends 
the annual determination of our common dividends is based on anticipated funds from operations available after preferred dividends and our reit taxable income  as well as assessments of annual capital spending  financing considerations  and other appropriate factors 
any inability of the operating partnership or its joint ventures to secure financing as required to fund maturing debts  capital expenditures and changes in working capital  including development activities and expansions  may require the utilization of cash to satisfy such obligations  thereby possibly reducing distributions to partners of the operating partnership and funds available to us for the payment of dividends 
on december   we declared a quarterly dividend of per common share  per share on our series g preferred stock  and on our series h preferred stock  all of which were paid on december  to shareowners of record on december  we also declared a special dividend of per share 
the special dividend was payable december  to common shareholders of record on december  this dividend was a result of the taxation of capital gains incurred from the liquidation of trg private reit and restructuring of our ownership in international plaza  a property in tampa  florida 
the private reit was formed in to raise capital from a foreign investor  who has since been bought out 
the dividend was necessary to fully distribute all of taubman center s projected taxable income for the tax year and comply with the reit distribution requirements under federal income tax law 
the liquidation has no impact on our funds from operations  our net income or our percentage ownership of international plaza
