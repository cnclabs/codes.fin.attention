current economic environment during  our business continued to benefit from an improved economic environment which began during the last half of for example  we grew bookings  revenues and renewal rates during as compared to we maintain our expectations of an improved demand environment for  and are expecting to grow revenues by to in fiscal as a result of recent booking activity from the prior months and our improved renewal rates

we also believe that investment managers will be increasingly focused on providing increased and differentiated levels of service to their customers 
these factors have traditionally been demand drivers for our products 
we believe our recent financial results validate the strength and stability of our business and the attractiveness of our product portfolio to our customers 
for example  our continuing operations have grown revenue  operating income and margin  and operating cash flows during compared to and grew compared to during a severe market downturn and global economic volatility 
in addition  we expect to see a continuing increase in demand for our products during due to new regulation requiring more transparency and thus  sophisticated accounting software  and growth in the demand from international markets 
business focus in  we view several investment opportunities such as international expansion and build out of our advent ondemand and tamale rms products that take precedence over expanding our near term operating margins 
as a result  we will invest in systems infrastructure  increase our hiring and adjust our compensation programs as required to manage our growth and develop and promote our products and services  and we anticipate our operating margin as a percentage of revenue to grow modestly in 
table of contents we believe our internal  or organic  growth and continued innovation with respect to our software and services business are the foundation of our long term strategic plan 
we invested of revenues in product development in to enhance our existing portfolio of products and services and to develop new products  features and services 
we also believe that an acquisition program is a supporting element of our corporate strategy which can strengthen our competitive position  expand our customer base  and provide greater scale to accelerate innovation 
we may continue to acquire companies  products  service and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy

new and incremental bookings 
the term license and advent ondemand contracts signed in will contribute approximately million in annual revenue annual contract value or acv once they are fully implemented 
this represents a increase over the million of acv booked from term license and advent ondemand contracts signed in improvement in renewal rate 
our renewal rate improved to a initial renewal rate for the third quarter of this represents a point improvement over the same period of international traction 
we continue to execute on our international growth strategy  with revenues from international sources totaling in this represents a point improvement over additionally  we signed new customers in bahrain  singapore  sweden  switzerland and the united kingdom in acquisition of goya as

we hosted a successful client conference in september with more than  attendees  which included executives from the many market segments we serve including asset managers  financial advisors  hedge funds  prime brokers  fund administrators  family offices  banks  broker dealers and trusts 
build out of new facilities

divestiture of microedge during  management determined that the continued growth in the not for profit community would require a significant investment of resources and decided to focus on the core business 
in connection with this decision  management explored divesting the microedge subsidiary and on october   we completed the sale of microedge

in addition  the assets and liabilities of microedge have been reclassified as assets and liabilities of discontinued operation in the company consolidated balance sheet for all periods presented 
unless noted otherwise  discussion in this document pertains only to continuing operations 
recent developments in february  we acquired syncova solutions  ltd  a united kingdom based company that provides margin management and debt finance reconciliation and optimization software 
cash consideration of approximately million was paid upon closing in february financial overview the components of revenue from continuing operations during and  and associated dollar and percentage fluctuations were as follows in thousands  except change fiscal years change change term license revenues maintenance revenues other recurring revenues total term license  maintenance and other recurring revenues recurring revenue as of total revenue asset under administration aua fees other perpetual license fees total perpetual license fees professional services and other total net revenues 
table of contents we recognized revenue of million from continuing operations during  which represented an increase of over the prior year 
this increase was driven by significant growth in other recurring revenues of million  as we recognized revenues for the full year in from outsourced services and data services contracts that went live in september  and to a lesser extent  from the increase in term license revenues of million due to our bookings activity from the previous months  growth in sales of our geneva and apx products and our improved renewal rates 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in maintenance revenues of million due to maintenance de activations and perpetual license customers migrating to term licenses 
perpetual license fees in were up compared to  primarily due to an increase of million in incremental assets under administration fees as our clients experienced modest growth in aua balances 
professional services and other revenues also increased due to greater consulting activity as a result of the continued growth in bookings driving additional implementations during and revenues generated by our annual client conference that we hosted in september total expenses from continuing operations  including cost of revenues  were million in  compared with million in our expenses increased in from as a result of costs associated with our client conference  which did not occur in  and investments made in product development to upgrade our products 
additionally  we made investments to expand our business which resulted in higher costs for travel and entertainment  payroll and related expenses  and facilities 
the increase in facilities costs reflects new offices in beijing and singapore  which were opened in the fourth quarter of and second quarter of  respectively 
domestic facility costs also increased as we consolidated our offices in new york city and boston during in  we signed lease agreements for our new facilities in these cities and during the first quarter of  we commenced the build out 
we occupied our former facilities in new york city and boston until the build out for our new facilities was completed  as a result  we incurred rent and utilities expense in both our former and new facilities during in these cities 
we completed the build out of our new facilities in new york and boston in may and august  respectively  and moved our operations to consolidate our facility space in both locations 
our operating income from continuing operations in increased to million or of revenue from million or of revenue in which is reflective of improved leverage in our operating expense categories 
product development and general and administrative costs were down by one percentage point in compared to last year 
our continuing operations income tax expense was million resulting in a effective tax rate during  compared to million or  respectively  in net income from continuing operations was million  resulting in diluted earnings per share of for  compared to million or  respectively  in our continuing operations generated operating cash flow of million in  which compares to million in term license and term license deferral we are substantially through the process of converting the company license revenues from a perpetual model to a predominantly term model 
when a customer purchases a term license together with implementation services  we do not recognize any revenue under the contract until the implementation services are complete and the remaining services are substantially complete 
if the implementation services are still in progress as of quarter end  we will defer all of the contract revenues to a subsequent quarter 
at the point professional services are substantially completed  we recognize a pro rata amount of the term license revenue  professional services fees earned and related expenses  based on the elapsed time from the start of the term license to the substantial completion of professional services 
term license revenue for the remaining contract years and the remaining deferred 
table of contents professional services revenue and related expenses are recognized ratably over the remaining contract length 
the term license component of the deferred revenue balance related to implementations in process will increase or decrease in the future depending on the amount of new term license bookings relative to the number of implementations that reach completion in a particular quarter 
during  the revenue recognized from completed implementations exceeded the revenue deferred from projects being implemented  resulting in a net recognition of revenue of million for fiscal  composed of million of term license revenue and million of professional services revenue 
subsequently in  we returned to our prior trend of net term license revenue deferral 
during  we deferred net revenues of million and directly related expenses of million associated with our term licensing model 
the impact of these deferrals on our operating income was approximately million 
the million net deferral of revenue is composed of a net deferral of million of professional services revenue and a net deferral of million of term license revenue 
we currently expect that the professional services component of the deferred revenue balance will continue to increase through at least amounts of revenues and directly related expenses deferred as of december  and associated with our term licensing deferral were as follows in millions december deferred revenues short term long term total directly related expenses short term long term total deferred net revenues and directly related expenses are classified as deferred revenues short term and long term  and prepaid expenses and other  and other assets  respectively  on the consolidated balance sheets 
non gaap financial measures and other operational data we also consider certain financial and operating measures that are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  including the annual contract value acv of term license and advent ondemand contracts  renewal rates  non gaap net income  non gaap net income per share and free cash flow in measuring the performance of our business 
the non gaap measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by gaap and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies 
however  we believe that this non gaap information is useful as an additional means for investors to evaluate our operating performance  when reviewed in conjunction with our gaap financial statements 
therefore  these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with gaap  and because these amounts are not determined in accordance with gaap  they should not be used exclusively in evaluating our business and operations 
in addition  undue reliance should not be placed upon non gaap or operating information because this information is neither standardized across companies nor subjected to the same control activities and audit procedures that produce our gaap financial results

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and related notes  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the process we use to develop estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other information that we believe is reasonable for making judgments at the time the estimates are made 
actual results may differ from our estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
we believe the following accounting policies contain the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and deferred revenues  income taxes  stock based compensation  restructuring charges and related accruals  business combinations  disposition  goodwill  impairment of long lived assets  legal contingencies  and sales returns and accounts receivable allowances 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policies contain our most significant judgments and estimates 
our revenue policy is further described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue from term license  maintenance and other recurring  perpetual license fees  and professional services and other 
we offer a wide variety of products and services to a large number of financially sophisticated customers 
while many of our lower priced license transactions  maintenance contracts  subscription based transactions and professional services projects conform to a standard structure  many of our larger transactions are complex and may require significant review and judgment in our application of generally accepted accounting principles 
software licenses 
we recognize revenue from the licensing of software when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
we generally use a signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding order forms and signed contracts from the distributor customers 
revenue is recognized once shipment to the distributor customer has taken place and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
delivery occurs when a product is delivered to a common carrier fob shipping point  or upon confirmation that product delivered fob shipping destination has been received  or upon notification that software is available for electronic download through our fulfillment vendor 
some of our arrangements include acceptance provisions  and if such acceptance provisions are present  delivery is deemed to occur upon acceptance 
we assess whether the 
table of contents fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
we assess whether the collectability of the resulting receivable is probable based on a number of factors  including the credit worthiness of the customer determined through review of credit reports  our transaction history with the customer  other available information and pertinent country risk if the customer is located outside the united states 
our standard payment terms are due at days or less  but payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed 
software licenses are sold with maintenance and  frequently  professional services 
we typically license our products on a per server  per user basis with the price per customer varying based on the selection of the products licensed  the assets under administration  the number of site installations and the number of authorized users 
we have substantially completed our transition from selling mostly perpetual licenses to selling a mix of term and perpetual licenses  and expect term license revenue to continue to increase as a proportion of total recurring revenues which we define as term license  maintenance and other recurring revenues in the future 
term license revenue comprised approximately  and of total term license  maintenance and other recurring revenues in  and  respectively 
revenue recognition for software licensed under term and perpetual license models differs depending on which type of contract a customer signs term licenses term license contracts include both the software license and maintenance services 
we offer multi year term licenses by which a customer makes a binding commitment that typically spans three years 
for multi year term licenses  we have not established vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value for the software license and maintenance components and  as a result  in situations where we are also performing related professional services  we defer all revenue and directly related expenses under the arrangement until the implementation services are complete and the remaining services are substantially complete 
at the point professional services are substantially completed  we recognize a pro rata amount of the term license revenue  professional services fees earned and related expenses  based on the elapsed time from the start of the term license to the substantial completion of professional services 
we determine whether services are substantially complete by consulting with the professional services group and applying management judgment 
term license revenue for the remaining contract years and the remaining deferred professional services revenue and related expenses are recognized ratably over the remaining contract length 
when multi year term licenses are sold and do not include related professional services  we recognize the entire term license revenue ratably over the period of the contract term from the effective date of the license agreement assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
revenues from term licenses are included in term license  maintenance and other recurring revenues on the consolidated statement of operations 
perpetual licenses we allocate revenue to delivered components  normally the license component of the arrangement  using the residual method  based on vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements generally the maintenance and professional services components  which is specific to us 
we determine the fair value of the undelivered elements based on the historical evidence of the company stand alone sales of these elements to third parties and or renewal rates 
if vsoe of fair value does not exist for any undelivered elements  then the entire arrangement fee is deferred until delivery of that element has occurred unless the only undelivered element is maintenance 
revenues from perpetual licenses are included in perpetual license fees revenue on the consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents certain of our perpetual and term license contracts include asset based fee structures that provide additional revenues based on the assets that the client manages using our software assets under administration or aua 
contracts containing an aua fee structure have a defined measurement period which requires the client to self report actual aua in arrears of the specified period 
aua fees above the stated minimum fee for the same period are considered incremental fees 
because incremental fees are not determinable until the conclusion of the measurement period  they are both earned and recognized upon completion of the measurement period  on a quarterly or annual basis 
incremental fees from perpetual aua contracts are included in perpetual license fees on the consolidated statement of operations 
incremental fees from term aua contracts are included in term license  maintenance and other recurring revenue on the consolidated statement of operations 
the company recognizes aua contract minimum fees over the period of service and continues to recognize incremental fees in arrears once clients contractually report the aua to the company  because the incremental fees are not determinable until reported 
maintenance and other recurring revenues 
we offer annual maintenance programs on perpetual licenses that provide for technical support and updates to our software products 
maintenance fees are bundled with perpetual license fees in the initial licensing year and charged separately for renewals of annual maintenance in subsequent years 
fair value for maintenance is based upon either renewal rates stated in the contracts or separate sales of renewals to customers 
generally  we recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the contract term 
we offer other recurring revenue services that are either subscription or transaction based which primarily include the provision of software interfaces to download securities information from third party data providers  partial or full business process outsourcing  account aggregation  reconciliation  reference data management  and hosting of hardware and or software 
we recognize revenue from recurring revenue transactions either ratably over the subscription period or as the transactions occur based on the terms of the arrangement 
professional services and other revenues 
we offer a variety of professional services that include project management  implementation  data conversion  integration  custom report writing and training 
we base fair value for professional services upon separate sales of these services to customers 
our professional services are generally billed based on hourly rates together with reimbursement for travel and accommodation expenses 
we recognize revenue as professional services are performed  except in the case of multi year term license contracts which are described in the term licenses section above 
certain professional services arrangements involve acceptance criteria and in these cases  revenue and related expenses are recognized upon acceptance 
professional services and other revenues also include revenue from our user conferences 
directly related expenses 
when we defer service revenues  we also defer the direct costs incurred in the delivery of those services to the extent those costs are recoverable through the future revenues on non cancelable contracts as prepaid contract expense 
we recognize those deferred costs as costs of professional services revenues proportionally and over the same period that the deferred revenue is recognized as service revenue 
when we defer license revenue  we defer the direct incremental costs incurred as a result of selling the contract ie sales commissions earned by the sales force as a part of their overall compensation because those costs would not have been incurred but for the acquisition of that contract 
we recognize those costs as sales and marketing expense proportionally and over the same period as the license revenues 
income taxes 
we account for worldwide income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities to be recognized as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
significant judgment is required to determine our worldwide income tax provision 
in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
many of these 
table of contents uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that have differing or preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to the appropriate taxing jurisdictions to reasonably allocate earnings 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are reasonable  the final outcome could be different from that which is reflected in our income tax provision and accruals 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the recognized net deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets  we must be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in the jurisdiction where the tax asset is located 
we consider forecasted earnings  identified future taxable income and prudent and reasonable tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the return is filed and the tax implication is known 
we are subject to audits by state  federal and foreign tax authorities 
our estimates for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax matter are judgmental 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities 
stock based compensation 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options  stock appreciation rights sar and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the fair value of our restricted stock units is calculated based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee exercise behavior  the risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock based on an equally weighted average of historical and implied volatility of the company common stock 
we determined that a blend of historical and implied volatility is more reflective of the market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than using purely historical volatility 
we estimate the expected life of options and sars granted based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
we base the risk free interest rate on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option and sar 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
these variables are sensitive and change on a daily basis 
as a result  the financial result from issuing the same number of options or sars can vary significantly over time 
the following table reflects the change in the fair value of a hypothetical option or sar as a result of a hypothetical change in one of the underlying assumptions assumption base case assumption change value change assumption change value change grant and stock price risk free interest rate volatility expected life years year year expected dividend yield base option value 
table of contents historically  our sar and stock option awards granted to employees cliff vest after one year and monthly thereafter over the next months 
starting in february  we reduced the vesting period from years to years  and sars and stock option awards granted to employees now cliff vest after one year and monthly thereafter over the next months 
our restricted stock unit rsu awards cliff vest after two years and after four years 
asc  compensation stock compensation  requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on our annual forfeiture rate 
the annual forfeiture rate is based on our historical forfeiture experience over the last ten years 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
a decrease in our annual forfeiture rate assumption would increase stock based compensation expense 
the estimated impact of a hypothetical basis point decrease in the annual forfeiture rate on stock based compensation expense for would have been an increase of approximately million 
restructuring charges and related accruals 
we have developed and implemented formalized plans for restructuring our business to better align our resources to market conditions and recorded significant charges 
in connection with these plans  we recorded estimated expenses for severance and benefits  lease cancellations  asset write offs and other restructuring costs 
given the significance of  and the timing of the execution of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made  including evaluating real estate market conditions for expected vacancy periods and sub lease rents 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of our restructuring plans  actual results may differ  thereby requiring us to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions 
business combinations 
when we acquire businesses  we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  especially with respect to intangible assets 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
these estimates can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future  the appropriate weighted average cost of capital  and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 
disposition 
when we dispose of a subsidiary  we account for the divestiture in accordance with asc  discontinued operations 
the results of operations and the related charges for the discontinued operation are classified as net income from discontinued operation  net of applicable taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
in addition  the assets and liabilities of the discontinued operation are reclassified as assets and liabilities of discontinued operation in our consolidated balance sheet for all periods presented 
the calculation of the gain on disposal of our discontinued operation required management to make significant estimates in the resulting facility exit costs 
in connection with the sale of microedge  the company vacated its microedge facilities in new york and entered into a sub lease agreement with the purchaser whereby the purchaser will sub lease the premises for two years with the option to extend the sub lease term through the end of the lease term in given the significance of  and the timing of the execution of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made  including evaluating the probability that the purchaser will decide to sub lease the premises beyond the initial two year period and through 
table of contents  evaluating real estate market conditions for expected vacancy periods and sub lease rents 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities related to this disposition 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect costs for our facility exit costs  actual results may differ  thereby requiring us to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions 
additionally  million of the purchase price has been placed in escrow for eighteen months following the close to be held as security for losses incurred by the purchaser in the event of certain breaches of the representations and warranties contained in the agreement or certain other events 
given the uncertainty associated with the potential losses  any gain on sale associated with the million held in escrow will be recorded by the company when realized 
goodwill 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year as of november and more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss has occurred 
we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
we determined that the company has two reporting units  domestic and international  which comprise our advent investment management segment  for the goodwill impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of the test for goodwill impairment is a two step process the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its respective carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of our reporting unit is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
the second step  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of each reporting unit goodwill with the respective carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is subjective and requires judgment at many points during the test including the development of future revenue and expense forecasts used to calculate future cash flows  the selection of risk adjusted discount rates  and determination of market comparable entities 
during the fourth quarter of  advent completed the first step of its annual impairment test and determined that advent reporting units as of the latest impairment testing date is substantially in excess of carrying value 
as advent determined that none of the reporting units were at risk for failing step one of the impairment testing  the second step of the impairment test was not necessary to perform 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review our other long lived assets including property and equipment and other intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
determining whether an impairment trigger has occurred is subjective and requires judgment 
our recoverability test compares the assets carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows 
we estimate future revenue and expense amounts to calculate future cash flows 
we believe our forecast revenue and expense amounts are reasonable but forecast amounts are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
legal contingencies 
from time to time  advent is involved in claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we use our judgment to assess both the likelihood and potential amount of a contingency 
we periodically review our assessment whenever there is a change in the facts and circumstances of these proceedings 
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and our view of these matters may change in the future 
were an unfavorable outcome to occur  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations for the period in which the unfavorable outcome occurs  and potentially in future periods 
sales returns and accounts receivable allowances 
our standard practice is to enforce our contract terms and not allow our customers to return software 
we have  however  allowed customers 
table of contents to return software on a limited case by case basis and have recorded sales returns provisions as offsets to revenue in the period the sales return becomes probable 
we use our judgment in estimating our sales returns 
we analyze customer demand  acceptance of products and historical returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns  which are not generally provided to customers 
beginning in the second quarter of  we changed our methodology to supplement our judgment for calculating the value of reserves that considered the last months of return experience 
our ability to estimate returns is based on our long history of experience with relatively homogenous transactions and the fact that the return period is short 
the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of returns and other related factors 
we have recorded a sales returns provision benefit to decrease increase revenue for these situations based on our historical experience of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we use our judgment in estimating our allowance for doubtful accounts 
in order to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze specific accounts receivables  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
we have recorded a provision for bad debt expense of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively

working capital at december   we had working capital of million  compared to negative working capital of million at december  the increase in our working capital at december  was primarily due to the generation of operating cash flow of million  and the shift of million of marketable securities from long term to short term  partially offset by common stock repurchases of million  capital expenditures of million  and cash paid to acquire goya as of million 
our negative working capital in was due to our common stock repurchases of million  our repayment on our credit facility of million  our purchase of long term marketable securities of million and our deferred revenue balance  which reflects our term pricing model 
excluding deferred revenues and deferred taxes  we had working capital of million at december   compared to million at december  credit facility and expiration in february  advent and certain of our domestic subsidiaries entered into a senior secured credit facility agreement the credit facility with wells fargo foothill  inc the lender 
under the credit facility  the lender provided the company with a revolving line of credit up to an aggregate amount of million  subject to a borrowing base formula  to provide backup liquidity for general corporate purposes  including stock repurchases  or investment opportunities for a period of three years 
during its three year term  we utilized the credit facility to facilitate the timing of stock repurchases 
in february  the credit facility expired and we elected not to renew the credit facility due to the limited expected use of the credit facility 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term marketable securities  together with cash expected to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund our operating activities  anticipated capital expenditures and 
table of contents authorized stock repurchases 
although the expiration of the credit facility may restrict our liquidity  we believe the costs associated with the credit facility would exceed the anticipated benefit of the additional liquidity 
for example  our interest expense decreased by million during common stock repurchases advent board has approved common stock repurchase programs authorizing management to repurchase shares of the company common stock 
the timing and actual number of shares subject to repurchase are at the discretion of advent management and are contingent on a number of factors and limitations  including the price of advent stock  corporate and regulatory requirements  alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions 
the stock repurchase programs specify a maximum number of shares subject to repurchase  do not have an expiration date and may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice 
repurchased shares are returned to the status of authorized and unissued shares of common stock 
the purchases are funded from combination of available working capital and debt 
the purchase price for the shares of our common stock repurchased was reflected as a reduction to stockholders equity 
in accordance with asc  treasury stock  we are required to allocate the purchase price of the repurchased shares as i an increase to accumulated deficit and ii a reduction of common stock and additional paid in capital 
issuance of common stock and the tax benefit related to employee stock option plans are recorded as an increase to common stock and additional paid in capital 
as a result of future repurchases  we may continue to report an accumulated deficit included in stockholders equity in our consolidated balance sheets 
the following is a summary of the repurchase programs authorized by the board since fiscal in thousands date of authorization number of shares authorized may october may total the following is a summary of the company repurchase activity since fiscal in thousands  except per share data fiscal year total number of shares repurchased cost average price paid per share total all share and per share information has been adjusted to reflect the two for one stock split effected in the form of stock dividend that was announced on december  and distributed on january  at december   there remained approximately million shares authorized by the board for repurchase 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands fiscal years thereafter total operating lease obligations  net of sub lease income on october   we completed the sale of our microedge subsidiary 
see note  discontinued operation  to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the principal terms of the divestiture 
with the exception of the microedge facilities in new york city  the leases related to microedge have been transferred to the purchaser 
in connection with the sale of microedge  the company entered into a sub lease agreement with microedge llc  whereby microedge llc will sub lease approximately  square feet of the  square feet of office space located at west th street in new york  new york from the company 
microedge llc will sub lease the premises for two years with the option to extend the sub lease term through the end of the lease term in the sub lease agreement became effective upon the close of sale of microedge on october  as of december   microedge had operating lease commitments totaling million  less sublease income of million  which are not reflected in the above table 
at december  and  we had a gross liability of million and million  respectively  for uncertain tax positions associated with the adoption of asc  income taxes overall recognition 
if recognized  the impact on our statement of operations would be to decrease our income tax expense and increase our net income by million 
the impact on net income reflects the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits net of the federal tax benefit of state income tax items 
since almost all of this liability relates to reserves against deferred tax assets that we do not expect to utilize in the short term  we cannot estimate the timing of potential future cash settlements and have not included any estimates in the table of contractual cash obligations above 
our cash payments for federal income taxes will continue to be nominal through as we have significant net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards to utilize 
at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
other liquidity and capital resources considerations as noted above  we expect our cash payments for federal income taxes to remain nominal over the next few years as we have significant net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards to utilize against current income taxes 
however  our cash payments for federal income taxes could increase as early as fiscal our liquidity and capital resources in any period could also be affected by the exercise of outstanding employee stock options and sars  and issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
the resulting increase in the number of outstanding shares from this and from the issuance of common stock from our rsus could also affect our per share results of operations 

table of contents however  we cannot predict the timing or amount of proceeds from the exercise of these securities  or whether they will be exercised at all 
we expect that for the next year  our operating expenses will continue to constitute a significant use of cash flow 
in addition  we may use cash to fund other acquisitions  repurchase additional common stock  or invest in other businesses  when opportunities arise 
based upon the predominance of our revenues from recurring sources  term license bookings performance and current expectations  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements  stock repurchases and financing activities for the next year 
however  if we identify opportunities that exceed our current expectation  we may choose to seek additional capital resources through debt or equity financing 
however  such financing may not be available at all particularly in the current economic environment  or if available may not be obtainable on terms favorable to us and could be dilutive 
recent accounting pronouncements refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting standards and pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
historically  much of our revenues and capital spending was transacted in us dollars 
however  since the acquisitions of advent denmark  advent norway  advent sweden  advent netherlands  and advent europe remaining distributors in the united kingdom and switzerland  whose service and certain license revenues and capital spending  are transacted in local country currencies  we have greater exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
additionally as of december   million of goodwill from the acquisition of these entities are denominated in foreign currency 
therefore a hypothetical change of could increase or decrease our assets and equity by million and could increase or decrease our consolidated results of operations or cash flows by approximately million 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types  and maturities 
our interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio  which consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents  and short term marketable securities as of december  our short term marketable securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
at any time  a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings of our investment portfolio 
we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
the following table presents hypothetical changes in fair value of our short term marketable securities of million at december  for december  the market changes reflect an immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  plus bps  and plus bps 
for balances at december  the hypothetical fair values are as follows in millions  except percentages decrease in interest rates increase in interest rates basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points 
table of contents we have also invested in several privately held companies 
these non marketable investments are classified as other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
our investments in privately held companies could be affected by an adverse movement in the financial markets for publicly traded equity securities  although the impact cannot be directly quantified 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products these privately held companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
it is our policy to review investments in privately held companies on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying amount and economic viability of these companies 
this policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing each of the companies cash position  financing needs  earnings revenue outlook  operational performance  management ownership changes and competition 
the evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately held companies 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies  and as such  the basis for these evaluations is subject to timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies 
our investments in privately held companies are assessed for impairment when a review of the investee operations indicates that a decline in value of the investment is other than temporary 
such indicators include  but are not limited to  limited capital resources  limited prospects of receiving additional financing  and prospects for liquidity of the related securities 
impaired investments in privately held companies are written down to estimated fair value 
we estimate fair value using a variety of valuation methodologies 
such methodologies include comparing the private company with publicly traded companies in similar lines of business  applying revenue and price earnings multiples to estimated future operating results for the private company and estimating discounted cash flows for that company 
we could lose our entire investment in these companies 
at december   our net investments in privately held companies totaled million
