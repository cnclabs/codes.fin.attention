item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item of this report 
historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results 
business overview we are a molecular diagnostic company focused on the development and global commercialization of genomic based clinical laboratory services that analyze the underlying biology of cancer  allowing physicians and patients to make individualized treatment decisions 
in january  we launched our first oncotype dx test  which is used to predict the likelihood of cancer recurrence and the likelihood of chemotherapy benefit in early stage breast cancer patients 
effective june   the list price of our oncotype dx breast cancer test increased from  to  in january  we launched our second oncotype dx test  which is used to predict the likelihood of cancer recurrence in stage ii colon cancer patients 
the list price for our oncotype dx colon cancer test is  substantially all of our historical revenues have been derived from the sale of oncotype dx breast cancer tests ordered by physicians in the united states 
for the year ended december   more than  oncotype dx test reports were delivered for use in treatment planning  compared to more than  and  test reports delivered for the years ended december  and  respectively 
all of our tests are conducted at our clinical reference laboratory in redwood city  california 
our clinical reference laboratory processing capacity is currently approximately  tests per calendar quarter 
as test processing for our oncotype dx breast and colon cancer tests is essentially the same  except that the tests use different rna extraction methods and analyze different genes  we believe that we currently have sufficient capacity to process both of our tests 
we depend upon third party payors to provide reimbursement for our tests 
accordingly  we have and expect to continue to focus substantial resources on obtaining reimbursement coverage from third party payors 
we have also continued to expand our business  both in the united states and internationally 
we plan to continue to use essentially the same business model internationally as we use in the united states  however  there are significant differences between countries that need to be considered 
for example  different countries may have a public healthcare system  a combination of public and private healthcare system or a cash based payment system 
our initial commercialization efforts in markets outside of the united states have focused on offering products on a patient self pay basis and  over time  seeking coverage from public health systems and private insurance on a country by country basis 
we have sales representatives in certain countries outside of the united states 
we may decide to work directly on our own in certain countries while continuing to utilize distributors in other countries 
we established a european subsidiary in february and have lead executives with assignments in the americas  europe and asia to support our international efforts 
we expect that international sales of our oncotype dx tests will be heavily dependent on the availability of reimbursement 
in many countries  governments are primarily responsible for reimbursing diagnostic tests 
governments often have significant discretion in determining whether a test will be reimbursed at all  and if 
table of contents so  how much will be paid 
we expect that it will take several years to establish broad coverage and reimbursement for our tests in countries outside of the united states  and we do not expect international product revenues to comprise more than of our total revenues until the second half of oncotype dx breast cancer test we believe increased demand for our oncotype dx breast cancer test resulted from our ongoing commercial efforts  continued publication of peer reviewed articles on studies we sponsored  conducted or collaborated on that support the use of and reimbursement for the test  clinical presentations at major symposia  and the inclusion of our breast cancer test in clinical practice guidelines 
however  this increased demand is not necessarily indicative of future growth rates  and we cannot assure you that this level of increased demand can be sustained or that publication of articles  future appearances or presentations at medical conferences or increased commercial efforts will have a similar impact on demand for our breast cancer test in the future 
sequential quarterly demand for our breast cancer test may also be impacted by other factors  including the economic environment and continued high unemployment levels  seasonal effects relating to physician and patient vacation schedules  our shift in commercial focus to our oncotype dx colon cancer test or any future products we may develop  and the number of clinical trials in process by cooperative groups or makers of other tests conducting experience studies 
most national and regional third party payors in the united states  along with the local medicare carrier for california with jurisdiction for claims submitted by us for medicare patients  have issued positive coverage determinations for our oncotype dx breast cancer test for patients with node negative  or n  estrogen receptor positive  or er  disease through contracts  agreements or policy decisions 
in june  the local carrier with jurisdiction for claims submitted by us for medicare patients extended its coverage for our breast cancer test to include er patients with node positive  or n  disease up to three positive lymph nodes 
additionally  some payors provide policy coverage for the use of our test in er patients with n disease  including lymph node micro metastasis greater than mm  but not greater than mm in size 
however  we may not be able to obtain reimbursement coverage from other payors for our test for breast cancer patients with n  er disease 
as of december   we had exclusive distribution agreements for our oncotype dx breast cancer test with distributors in countries outside of the united states  and have established reimbursement arrangements for this test with several public and private payors and hospitals 
we have obtained coverage for our test in canada  ireland  germany  greece  israel and the united kingdom and have completed or initiated multiple international studies intended to support the adoption of our breast cancer test outside of the united states 
in october  we announced positive results from our first european clinical decision impact study demonstrating that knowledge of the oncotype dx breast cancer recurrence score result changed oncologist s treatment decisions in over of patients  which is consistent with us decision impact studies 
in november  breast cancer research treatment published positive results from a japanese economic evaluation study demonstrating that the inclusion of oncotype dx in japan s social health insurance benefit package would be cost effective 
in december  we presented positive preliminary results from a large adjuvant breast cancer trial with clinical researchers in germany using the oncotype dx breast cancer test to select patients for study randomization and treatment 
oncotype dx colon cancer test we expect to continue to focus substantial resources on pursuing global adoption of and reimbursement for our oncotype dx colon cancer test  which we launched in january we believe the key factors that will drive adoption of this test include publication of peer reviewed articles on the quasar clinical validation study and other studies we sponsored  conducted or collaborated on that support the use of and reimbursement for the test  clinical presentations at major symposia and our ongoing commercial efforts 
we are working with public and private payors and health plans to secure coverage for our colon cancer test based upon clinical evidence showing the utility of the test 
we may need to hire additional commercial  scientific  technical and other personnel to support this process 
we have obtained limited reimbursement coverage from third party payors for our oncotype dx colon cancer test 
as a new test  our colon cancer test may be considered investigational by payors and therefore may not be covered under their reimbursement policies 
consequently  we intend to pursue case by case reimbursement and 
table of contents expect that this test will continue to be reviewed on this basis until policy decisions have been made by individual payors 
we are also working with public and private payors and health plans to secure coverage for our oncotype dx colon cancer test based upon clinical evidence showing the utility of the test 
we believe it may take several years to achieve reimbursement with a majority of third party payors for our colon cancer test 
however  we cannot predict whether  or under what circumstances  payors will reimburse for this test 
based upon our experience in obtaining adoption of and reimbursement for our oncotype dx breast cancer test  we do not expect product revenues from our colon cancer test to comprise more than of our total revenues for at least the next year or more 
during the second quarter of  we completed sample processing for our second stage ii colon cancer recurrence study and plan to report results in we also initiated the first treatment decision impact study of our colon cancer test and are currently enrolling patients 
we are planning additional studies to support the clinical utility and assess the treatment impact and health economic benefit of our colon cancer test 
product pipeline we are investigating the utility of oncotype dx in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ  or dcis  breast cancer  which generally refers to a pre invasive tumor with reduced risk of recurrence 
in early  we presented positive results from a dcis breast cancer feasibility study demonstrating that ribonucleic acid  or rna  extraction and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  or rt pcr  technology can be successfully performed to assess gene expression profiles from fixed paraffin embedded  or fpe  tissues 
we plan to evaluate the use of the oncotype dx gene breast cancer panel and also seek to identify other genes that may be used for treatment planning in dcis 
we are conducting a dcis clinical validation study and plan to report results in the first half of in june  we presented positive results from an evaluation of biological similarities and differences between stage ii and stage iii colon cancer suggesting the oncotype dx colon cancer recurrence score result may also predict recurrence risk in stage iii colon cancer 
we plan to continue conducting early development tests to evaluate our oncotype dx colon cancer test for treatment planning in stage iii disease  and we are also conducting studies to investigate our colon cancer test s ability to predict chemotherapy benefit in stage ii and stage iii colon cancer patients treated with oxaliplatin 
in december  we presented positive first results from our prostate gene identification study 
the study  which applied the same rt pcr technology used in our oncotype dx breast and colon cancer tests  identified genes strongly associated with clinical recurrence of prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy 
based on these results  we announced that we are moving forward with full clinical development for a prostate cancer test and plan to conduct multiple additional studies 
we expect to report full gene identification results in in june  we presented results from our first renal gene identification study under our collaboration agreement with pfizer inc for the development of a genomic test to estimate the risk of recurrence following surgery for patients with stage i iii renal carcinoma  clear cell type  that has not spread to other parts of the body 
the study results demonstrated a strong correlation between gene expression and recurrence risk in this patient population 
we plan to initiate a renal cancer clinical validation study in technology we are developing high throughput  next generation sequencing  or ngs  to be our primary technology for future gene discovery 
ngs technologies parallelize the sequencing process  producing thousands or millions of sequences at once 
these technologies are intended to provide dna sequence information at lower cost than standard methods 
we have created proprietary methods for ngs of fpe tissue nucleic acids  created bioinformatics programs and infrastructure for data storage and analysis  and plan to rely on ngs as the basic source of new biomarkers in the future 

table of contents economic environment continuing concerns over prolonged high unemployment levels across the united states  the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market  the us real estate market  federal budget proposals  inflation  deflation  taxation issues  energy costs and geopolitical issues have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the us economy 
these factors  combined with declines in business and consumer confidence and a volatile stock market  have precipitated an economic slowdown and expectations of slower global economic growth going forward 
we periodically evaluate the impact of this environment on our cash management  cash collection activities and volume of tests delivered 
as of the date of this report  we have not experienced a loss of principal on any of our investments  and we expect that we will continue to be able to access or liquidate these investments as needed to support our business activities 
from time to time  we monitor the financial position of our significant third party payors  which include medicare and managed care companies 
as of the date of this report  we do not expect the current economic environment to have a material negative impact on our ability to collect payments from third party payors in the foreseeable future 
the economic environment continued to have a negative impact on growth in tests delivered during the year ended december   particularly in areas of the united states with high unemployment levels where patients have lost healthcare coverage  delayed medical checkups or are unable to pay for our tests 
we intend to continue to assess the impact of the economic environment on our business activities 
if the economic environment does not improve or deteriorates  the volume of tests delivered could continue to be negatively impacted and we could  in turn  experience lower revenues 
us healthcare legislation the recently enacted patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act  or  collectively  the ppaca  makes changes that are expected to significantly impact the pharmaceutical and medical device industries and clinical laboratories 
the ppaca contains a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund expanded health insurance coverage  including new fees or taxes on certain health related industries  including medical device manufacturers 
beginning in  each medical device manufacturer will have to pay sales tax in an amount equal to of the price for which such manufacturer sells its medical devices 
though there are some exceptions to the tax  because the fda maintains that clinical laboratory tests that are developed and validated by a laboratory for its own use  or ldts  such as our oncotype dx breast and colon cancer tests  are medical devices  it may apply to some or all of our current products and products in development 
the ppaca also mandates a reduction in payments for clinical laboratory services paid under the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule  in addition to a productivity adjustment to the clinical laboratory fee schedule 
in addition  the ppaca establishes a board that is charged with reducing the per capita rate of growth in medicare spending 
these reductions in payments may apply to some or all of our clinical laboratory tests delivered to medicare beneficiaries 
we are monitoring the impact of the ppaca in order to enable us to determine the trends and changes that may be necessitated by the legislation that may potentially impact on our business over time 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could therefore differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition we determine whether revenue is recognized on an accrual basis when test results are delivered or on a cash basis when cash is received from the payor 
our revenues for tests performed are recognized on an accrual basis when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the nature of the fee charged for the products or services delivered and existing contractual agreements 
when evaluating collectibility  we consider whether we have sufficient history to reliably estimate a payor s individual payment patterns 
based upon at least several months of payment history  we review the number of tests paid against the number of tests billed and the payor s outstanding balance for unpaid tests to determine whether payments are being made at a consistently high percentage of tests billed and at appropriate amounts given the contracted payment amount 
to the extent all criteria set forth above are not met  including where there is no evidence of payment history at the time test results are delivered  product revenues are recognized on a cash basis when cash is received from the payor 
as of december   we had distributor agreements in countries outside of the united states the distributor provides us with certain marketing and administrative services within its territory 
as a condition of these agreements  the distributor pays us an agreed upon fee per test and we process the tests 
the same revenue recognition criteria described above generally apply to tests received through international distributors 
product revenues for tests performed are recognized on an accrual basis when the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
to the extent all criteria set forth above are not met when test results are delivered  product revenues are generally recognized when cash is received from the distributor 
test revenue recognized on an accrual basis is recorded upon delivery of each test performed  net of any contractual discount at the amount that we expect to collect 
we determine the amount we expect to collect on a per payor  per contract or agreement basis  based on our analysis of historical average payments 
this average amount is typically lower than the agreed upon amount due to several factors  such as the amount of patient co payments  the existence of secondary payors and claim denials 
we typically review our analysis annually  or at the time a contractual price change is implemented or when information comes to our attention that leads us to believe an adjustment may be warranted 
as of december   amounts outstanding for tests delivered  net of write downs and adjustments  which were not recognized as revenue upon delivery because our accrual revenue recognition criteria were not met and which had not been collected  totaled approximately million 
we cannot provide any assurance as to when  if ever  and to what extent these amounts will be collected 
from time to time  we receive requests for refunds of payments  generally due to overpayments made by third party payors 
upon becoming aware of a refund request  we establish an accrued liability for tests covered by the refund request until such time as we determine whether or not a refund is due 
if we determine that a refund is due  we credit cash and reduce the accrued liability 
accrued refunds were  and  at december  and  respectively 
contract revenues are generally derived from studies conducted with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies and are recognized on a contract specific basis 
under certain contracts  revenues are recognized as costs are incurred or assays are processed 
we may exercise judgment when estimating full time equivalent level of effort  costs incurred and time to project completion 
for certain contracts  we utilize the performance based method of revenue recognition  which requires that we estimate the total amount of costs to be expended for a project and recognize revenue equal to the portion of costs expended to date 
the estimated total costs to be expended are necessarily subject to revision from time to time as the underlying facts and circumstances change 
accounts receivable we accrue an allowance for doubtful accounts against our accounts receivable based on estimates consistent with historical payment experience 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is evaluated quarterly and adjusted when 
table of contents trends or significant events indicate that a change in estimate is appropriate 
historically  the amounts of uncollectible accounts receivable that have been written off have been consistent with management s expectations 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience higher than expected write offs in the future 
as of december  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  respectively 
see liquidity and capital resources for additional information  including a summary of accounts receivable aging by payor mix 
research and development expenses we enter into collaboration and clinical trial agreements with clinical collaborators and record these costs as research and development expenses 
we record accruals for estimated study costs comprised of work performed by our collaborators under contract terms 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiations  may vary from contract to contract  and may result in uneven payment flows 
we determine our estimates through discussion with internal clinical development personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of services provided and the agreed upon fee to be paid for such services 
advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
all potential future product programs outside of breast and colon cancer are in the research or early development phase 
although we have estimated the time frame in which some of these products may be brought to market  the timing is uncertain given the technical challenges and clinical variables that exist between different types of cancers 
we maintain information regarding costs incurred for activities performed under certain contracts with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies 
however  we do not generally record or maintain information regarding costs incurred in research and development on a program specific basis 
our research and development staff and associated infrastructure resources are deployed across several programs 
many of our costs are thus not attributable to individual programs 
as a result  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development programs or when  if ever  and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product 
stock based compensation expense our employee stock based compensation is estimated at the date of grant based on the fair value of the award using the black scholes option valuation model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period 
the application of option valuation models requires significant judgment and the use of estimates  particularly surrounding assumptions used in determining fair value 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the use of estimates such as stock price volatility and expected option lives  as well as expected option forfeiture rates  to value stock based compensation 
our assumptions regarding expected volatility are based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
the expected life of options is estimated based on historical option exercise data and assumptions related to unsettled options 
expected option forfeiture rates are based on historical data  and compensation expense is adjusted for actual results 
we review our valuation assumptions on an ongoing basis  and  as a result  our assumptions used to value employee stock based awards granted in future periods may change 
see note  stock based compensation  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k for more information 
deferred tax assets we are required to reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we must use judgment in assessing the potential need for a valuation allowance  which requires an evaluation of both negative and positive evidence 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
in determining the need for and amount of our valuation allowance  if any  we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets using historical levels of income  estimates of future income and tax planning strategies 
as a result of historical cumulative losses  we determined that  based on all available evidence  there was substantial uncertainty as to our ability to realize recorded net deferred taxes in future 
table of contents periods 
accordingly  we recorded a valuation allowance against all of our net deferred tax assets for the years ended december  and  respectively 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and we recorded net income of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss for the years ended december  and of million and million  respectively 
on a basic per share basis  net income was for the year ended december  and net loss was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on a diluted per share basis  net income was for the year ended december  and net loss was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we may incur net losses in future periods due to future spending and fluctuations in our business  and we may not maintain profit levels in the future 
revenues we derive our revenues primarily from product sales and  to a lesser extent  from contract research arrangements 
we operate in one industry segment 
as of december   substantially all of our product revenues have been derived from the sale of our oncotype dx breast cancer test 
payors are billed upon generation and delivery of a recurrence score report to the physician 
product revenues are recorded on a cash basis unless a contract or arrangement to pay is in place with the payor at the time of billing and collectibility is reasonably assured 
contract revenues are derived from studies conducted with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies and are recorded as contractual obligations are completed 
year ended december  in thousands product revenues contract revenues total revenues year over year dollar increase in product revenues year over year percentage increase in product revenues the year over year increases in product revenues resulted from increased adoption  as evidenced by a increase in test volume for the year ended december  and a increase in test volume for the year ended december  we also experienced expanded reimbursement coverage and an increase in revenues recorded on an accrual basis 
approximately million  or  of product revenues for the year ended december   were recorded on an accrual basis and recognized at the time the test results were delivered  compared to million  or  and million  or  of product revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for all periods  the balance of product revenues was recognized upon cash collection as payments were received 
product revenues related to medicare patients for the year ended december  were million  or  of product revenues  compared to million  or  and million  or  of product revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
there were no other third party payors comprising product revenues of or more for those years 
international product revenues were million  or of product revenues  for the year ended december   compared to million  or of product revenues  and million  or of product revenues  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
product revenues for the year ended december  were affected by delayed receipt of approximately million in payments from two third party payors 
the delays resulted from interruptions in payments due to contract and documentation requirements  which were resolved and recorded in the first half of the timing of recognition of revenue related to these and other third party payments may cause fluctuations in product revenues from period to period 

table of contents contract revenues were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
contract revenues represented studies assessing our gene expression technology or collaborative work in gene selection and protocol design with our pharmaceutical partners 
the increase in contract revenues for compared to was due primarily to the recognition of deferred revenue from a previously completed contract 
the increase in contract revenues for compared to was due entirely to ongoing activities related to our collaboration with pfizer inc we expect that our contract revenues will continue to fluctuate based on the number and timing of studies being conducted 
cost of product revenues year ended december  in thousands tissue sample processing costs employee stock based compensation total tissue sample processing costs license fees total cost of product revenues year over year dollar increase year over year percentage increase cost of product revenues represents the cost of materials  direct labor  equipment and infrastructure expenses associated with processing tissue samples including histopathology  anatomical pathology  paraffin extraction  rt pcr  quality control analyses and shipping charges to transport tissue samples and license fees 
infrastructure expenses include allocated facility occupancy and information technology costs 
costs associated with performing our test are recorded as tests are processed 
costs recorded for tissue sample processing represent the cost of all the tests processed during the period regardless of whether revenue was recognized with respect to that test 
royalties for licensed technology calculated as a percentage of product revenues and fixed annual payments relating to the launch and commercialization of oncotype dx tests are recorded as license fees in cost of product revenues at the time product revenues are recognized or in accordance with other contractual obligations 
while license fees are generally calculated as a percentage of product revenues  the percentage increase in license fees does not correlate exactly to the percentage increase in product revenues because certain agreements contain provisions for fixed annual payments and other agreements have tiered rates and payments that may be capped at annual minimum or maximum amounts 
license fees represent a significant component of our cost of product revenues and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future 
tissue sample processing costs increased million  or  in compared to  and million  or  in compared to  driven by increases in test volume of and in and  respectively  which were partially offset by cost controls and efficiency gains 
license fees increased  or  in compared to and million  or  in compared to license fees for the year ended december  included a decrease of approximately million related to the discontinuance of certain license fees  representing of product revenues  resulting from the abandonment of a patent by the licensor 
these decreases were offset by increases in license fees related to other licenses of million  due to primarily to increased product revenues  and  of expense related to fixed annual payments to one of our collaborators triggered by the january launch of our oncotype dx colon cancer test 
we expect the cost of product revenues to increase in future periods to the extent we process more tests 

table of contents research and development expenses year ended december  in thousands personnel related expenses employee stock based compensation collaboration expenses reagents and laboratory supplies infrastructure and all other costs total research and development expenses year over year dollar increase decrease year over year percentage increase decrease research and development expenses represent costs incurred to develop our technology and carry out clinical studies and include personnel related expenses  reagents and supplies used in research and development laboratory work  infrastructure expenses  including allocated overhead and facility occupancy costs  contract services and other outside costs 
research and development expenses also include costs related to activities performed under contracts with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies 
the million  or  decrease in research and development expenses for compared to included a million decrease in personnel related expenses and a  decrease in reagents and laboratory supplies expense due primarily to cost controls  efficiency gains  project timing and reagents and supplies use for ongoing research and development activities  and the movement of our oncotype dx colon cancer test from development and commercialization in to product launch in these decreases were partially offset by a  increase in infrastructure and other expenses  including allocated information technology salaries and benefits and other costs for projects related to ngs 
of the million decrease in personnel related expenses  million was attributable to decreases in salaries  benefits and related expenses   was related to lower bonus payments and  was attributable to decreased contract labor and consulting expenses 
the decreases in salaries and bonus payments were primarily due to lower headcount  as open positions resulting from attrition had not been filled in the million  or  increase in research and development expenses for compared to included a million increase in allocated information technology salaries and benefits and other costs related to the development of our colon cancer test  a million increase in personnel related expenses  a million increase in reagents and laboratory supplies  a  increase in collaborations expense due primarily to gene discovery work and a  increase in infrastructure and other costs 
the million increase in personnel related expenses included million in salary increases and  in higher benefits and other expenses 
the increases in reagents  laboratory supplies and collaboration expenses were primarily due to early development studies for renal  prostate  and small cell lung cancer programs 
we expect our research and development expenses due to increased investment in new our product pipeline for breast  colon  renal  prostate and other cancers 

table of contents selling and marketing expenses year ended december  in thousands personnel related expenses employee stock based compensation promotional and marketing materials travel  meetings and seminars infrastructure and all other costs total selling and marketing expenses year over year dollar increase year over year percentage increase our selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses  education and promotional expenses and infrastructure expenses  including allocated facility occupancy and information technology costs 
these expenses include the costs of educating physicians  laboratory personnel and other healthcare professionals regarding our genomic technologies  how our oncotype dx tests are developed and validated and the value of the quantitative information that our tests provide 
selling and marketing expenses also include the costs of sponsoring continuing medical education  medical meeting participation and dissemination of scientific and economic publications related to our oncotype dx tests 
our sales force compensation includes annual salaries and eligibility for quarterly commissions based on the achievement of predetermined sales goals 
the million  or  increase in selling and marketing expenses for compared to was primarily due to a million increase in personnel related expenses  a million increase in infrastructure and other expenses  including allocations for information technology  recruiting and other expenses  a million increase in promotional field expenses and marketing materials and a  increase in travel  meetings and seminars expenses 
these increases included costs related to the addition of eight us sales representatives in january and to our continued international expansion efforts 
of the million increase in personnel related expenses  million was attributable to increases in salaries  benefits and related expenses  million was attributable to higher consulting expenses to support our international expansion and colon cancer product launch and million was attributable to higher commissions and bonus payments 
the million  or  increase in selling and marketing expenses for compared to was primarily due to an million increase in personnel related expenses  a million increase in infrastructure and other expenses  a million increase in promotional field expenses and marketing materials  a million increase in travel related expenses  and a  increase in stock based compensation 
these increases included costs related to the addition of us sales representatives in january and to our international expansion activities 
of the million increase in personnel related expenses  million was attributable to increases in salaries  benefits and related expenses  million was attributable to higher consulting expenses to support our international expansion and colon product launch   was attributable to higher commissions and bonus payments  and  was attributable to increases in recruiting and relocation expenses 
we expect selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase in future periods due to our efforts to establish adoption of and reimbursement for our oncotype dx colon cancer test  continued investment in our global commercial infrastructure and increases in our sales force 

table of contents general and administrative expenses year ended december  in thousands personnel related expenses employee stock based compensation billing and collection fees bad debt expense professional fees and all other costs total general and administrative expenses year over year dollar increase year over year percentage increase our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses  billing and collection fees  bad debt expense and professional fees and other costs  including intellectual property defense and prosecution costs  and other professional and administrative costs and related infrastructure expenses  including allocated facility occupancy and information technology costs 
the million  or  increase in general and administrative expenses for compared to included a million increase in personnel related expenses  including the addition of in house legal staff in and in the second half of  salary increases and benefits expenses  a  increase in billing and collection fees related to increased test volume and cash collections  a  increase in bad debt expense and a  increase in stock based compensation  partially offset by a  decrease in professional fees  including legal expenses 
the million  or  increase in general and administrative expenses for compared to included a million increase in billing and collection fees related to increases in the number of tests processed and cash collections  an  increase in personnel related expenses  including the addition of in house legal staff in the second half of  salary increases and benefits expenses  a  increase in professional fees  due primarily to legal fees for regulatory and international matters  a  increase in stock based compensation  a  increase in infrastructure expenses  a  increase in travel related expenses and a  increase in bad debt expense 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as we hire additional staff and incur other expenses to support the growth of our business  and to the extent we spend more on both billing and collections fees and bad debt expense 
we expect billing and collections fees and bad debt expense in total will continue to be approximately of product revenues for at least the next year or more 
interest and other income interest and other income was  for the year ended december  compared to  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decreases in interest and other income for and compared to the prior year comparative periods reflected lower market yields on our investment portfolio 
we expect our interest income will remain nominal if the current low interest rate environment continues 
interest and other expense interest and other expense was  for the year ended december  compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decreases in interest and other expense for and compared to prior year comparative periods were primarily due to lower average balances on our equipment financing notes as we paid them down 
these notes were paid in full as of november we do not anticipate using additional equipment financing as a funding source in the next twelve months 

table of contents income tax expense benefit for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax benefit of  which was principally comprised of a benefit for the reversal of alternative minimum income tax  partially offset by other state income taxes and foreign taxes 
for the year ended december   we recorded income tax expense of approximately  which was principally comprised of california state income tax  federal alternative minimum tax and foreign income taxes 
for the year ended december   we recorded income tax benefit of approximately  which was comprised of minimum state income taxes excluding the impact of an estimated refundable credit receivable 
as a result of historical losses since inception and based on all available evidence  we continue to believe that there is substantial uncertainty as to whether we will recover recorded net deferred taxes in future periods 
accordingly  we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets until sufficient evidence exists to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we may incur net losses in the future  and we cannot provide assurance as to when  if ever  we will achieve sustained profitability 
we expect that our research and development  selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods and  as a result  we will need to continue to generate significant product revenues to achieve sustained profitability 
sources of liquidity at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million compared to million at december  the million increase was attributable to increased cash collections from sales of our tests  payments from collaborators and cash received from the exercise of employee stock options  which were partially offset by investments in the growth of our business  including research and development  international expansion and activities related to our colon cancer product launch in january in accordance with our investment policy  available cash is invested in short term  low risk  investment grade debt instruments 
our cash and short term investments are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments including money market accounts  us treasury securities  debt obligations of us government sponsored entities  and high grade commercial paper and corporate bonds 
historically we have financed our operations primarily through sales of our equity securities and cash received in payment for our tests 
purchases of equipment and leasehold improvements have been partially financed through capital equipment financing arrangements 
our notes payable under these arrangements were paid in full as of november accounts receivable at december  and  million  or  and million  or  respectively  of our total assets consisted of accounts receivable 
the million year over year increase in accounts receivable was attributable to additional payors moving from cash basis to accrual basis during days sales outstanding  or dsos  is a measure of the average number of days it takes for us to collect our accounts receivable  calculated from the date that tests are billed 
at december  and  our average dsos were days and days  respectively 
the timing of our billing and cash collections causes fluctuations in our monthly dsos and accounts receivable

contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december  and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands non cancelable operating lease obligations our non cancelable operating lease obligations are for laboratory and office space 
in september  we entered into a non cancelable lease for  square feet of laboratory and office space in redwood city  california 
in november  we exercised an option to extend the term of this lease to march in january  we entered into a non cancelable lease for  square feet of additional laboratory and office space in a nearby location 
in november  we exercised an option to extend the term of this lease to march in october  we entered into a non cancelable lease an additional  square feet of office space in a nearby location 
this lease expires in march in may  we entered into a non cancelable lease for  square feet of property in geneva  switzerland 
this lease expires in may we are required to make a series of fixed annual payments under one of our collaboration agreements beginning on the date that we commercially launched our oncotype dx breast cancer test 
we made payments under this agreement of  in each of the years   and a final annual payment of  was made under this agreement in january we are also required to make a series of fixed annual payments under a separate collaboration agreement beginning with the january launch of our oncotype dx colon cancer test 
we made a payment of  in as of december   future annual payments under this agreement totaled million  of which  is due in   is due in and  is due in each of the years  and however  because both of these agreements may be terminated by either party upon days prior written notice  these payments are not included in the table above 

table of contents we have also committed to make potential future payments to third parties as part of our collaboration agreements 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of specific project milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is generally neither probable nor reasonably estimable  such commitments have not been included in the table above 
off balance sheet activities as of december   we had no material off balance sheet arrangements 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we achieved positive operating cash flow for the years ended december  and we currently anticipate that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with payments for our oncotype dx tests  will be sufficient to fund our operations and facilities expansion plans for at least the next months  including the expansion of our research and development programs  establishment of adoption of and reimbursement for our oncotype dx colon cancer test  and our international expansion efforts 
we expect to spend approximately million over the next months for planned laboratory equipment  information technology expansion and facilities expansion 
we may also use cash to acquire or invest in complementary businesses  technologies  services or products 
we expect that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be also be used to fund working capital and for other general corporate purposes  such as licensing technology rights  distribution arrangements for our tests outside of the united states or expanding our direct sales capabilities outside of the us the amount and timing of actual expenditures may vary significantly depending upon a number of factors  such as the amount of cash provided by our operations  the progress of our commercialization efforts  product development  regulatory requirements  progress in reimbursement for our tests and available strategic opportunities for acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses  technologies  services or products 
we cannot be certain that our international expansion plans  efforts to establish adoption of and reimbursement for our oncotype dx colon cancer test or the development of future products will be successful or that we will be able to raise sufficient additional funds to see these activities through to a successful result 
it may take years to move any one of a number of product candidates in research through development and validation to commercialization 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including the following the rate of progress in establishing reimbursement arrangements with domestic and international third party payors  the cost of expanding our commercial and laboratory operations  including our selling and marketing efforts  the rate of progress and cost of research and development activities associated with expansion of our oncotype dx breast and colon cancer tests  the rate of progress and cost of selling and marketing activities associated with establishing adoption of and reimbursement for our oncotype dx colon cancer test  the rate of progress and cost of research and development activities associated with products in research and early development focused on cancers other than breast and colon cancer  costs related to future product launches  the cost of acquiring or achieving access to tissue samples and technologies  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the effect of competing technological and market developments  costs related to international expansion  
table of contents the cost and delays in product development as a result of any changes in regulatory oversight applicable to our products or operations  the impact of changes in federal  state and international taxation  and the economic and other terms and timing of any collaborations  licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter or investments or acquisitions we might seek to effect 
if we are not able to generate and maintain sustained product revenues to finance our cash requirements  we will need to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  borrowings or strategic collaborations or licensing arrangements 
if we raise funds by issuing equity securities  dilution to stockholders may result 
any equity securities issued may also provide for rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock 
if we raise funds by issuing debt securities  these debt securities would have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock 
the terms of debt securities or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations 
if we raise funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements  we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our technologies or products  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
the credit market and financial services industry have in the past  and may in the future  experience periods of upheaval that could impact the availability and cost of equity and debt financing 
if we are not able to secure additional funding when needed  on acceptable terms  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more research and development programs or selling and marketing initiatives 
in addition  we may have to work with a partner on one or more of our product or market development programs  which could lower the economic value of those programs to us 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued authoritative guidance for applying the milestone method of revenue recognition to research and development arrangements 
under this guidance  revenue contingent upon the achievement of a milestone in its entirety may be recognized in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone meets all the criteria within the guidance to be considered substantive 
this guidance is effective on a prospective basis for research and development milestones achieved in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after june  this guidance  which we do not expect to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations  will become effective for us on january  in october  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that amends existing guidance for identifying separate deliverables in a revenue generating transaction where multiple deliverables exist  and provides guidance for allocating and recognizing revenue based on those separate deliverables 
the guidance is expected to result in more multiple deliverable arrangements being separable than under current guidance and is required to be applied prospectively to new or significantly modified revenue arrangements 
this guidance  which we do not expect to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations  will become effective for us on january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned on our cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
our investment policy provides for investments in short term  low risk  investment grade debt instruments 
our investments in marketable securities  which are comprised primarily of money market funds  obligations of us government agencies and government sponsored entities  commercial paper and corporate bonds  are subject to default  changes in credit rating and changes in market value 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  totaling million at december   did not include any auction preferred stock  auction rate securities or mortgage backed investments 
we currently do not 
table of contents hedge interest rate exposure  and we do not have any foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments 
the securities in our investment portfolio are classified as available for sale and are  due to their short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
to date  we have not experienced a loss of principal on any of our investments 
although we currently expect that our ability to access or liquidate these investments as needed to support our business activities will continue  we cannot ensure that this will not change 
we believe that  if market interest rates were to change immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   the impact on the fair value of these securities or our cash flows or income would not be material 
foreign currency exchange risk substantially all of our revenues are recognized in us dollars 
certain expenses related to our international activities are payable in foreign currencies 
as a result  factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets will affect our financial results 
we recognized net realized foreign exchange transaction losses of  for the year ended december  we had no foreign currency transaction gains or losses for the years ended december  and  respectively  as our total payables denominated in foreign currency during those periods were not material 
the functional currency of our wholly owned european subsidiary is the us dollar  so we are not currently subject to gains and losses from foreign currency translation of the subsidiary financial statements 
we currently do not hedge foreign currency exchange rate exposure 
although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has been immaterial in the past  there can be no guarantee the impact of currency fluctuations related to our international activities will not be material in the future
