item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we have reclassified management s discussion and analysis for all periods presented to reflect the consolidated financial results of fox international ltd 
as discontinued operations 
see results of operations discontinued operations later in this item for more information 
unless otherwise noted  discussions below pertain to our continuing operations 
additionally  as fox international ltd  represented our entire wholesale segment  we have also reflected that change by presenting all periods in one reportable segment 
overview the company is a worldwide leader in the manufacturing and distribution of a wide range of display devices  encompassing  among others  industrial  military  medical  and simulation display solutions 
the company is comprised of one segment the manufacturing and distribution of displays and display components 
the company is organized into four interrelated operations aggregated into one reportable segment pursuant to the aggregation criteria of fasb asc topic segment reporting monitors offers a wide range of crt  flat panel and projection display systems for use in training and simulation  military  medical  and industrial applications 
data display crts offers a wide range of crts for use in data display screens  including computer terminal monitors and medical monitoring equipment 
entertainment crts offers a wide range of crts and projection tubes for television and home theater equipment 
component parts provides replacement electron guns and other components for crts primarily for servicing the company s internal needs 
during fiscal  management of the company focused key resources on strategic efforts to dispose of unprofitable operations and seeking acquisition opportunities that enhance the profitability and sales growth of the company s more profitable product lines 
the company continues to seek new products through acquisitions and internal development that complement existing profitable product lines 
challenges facing the company during these efforts include inventory management the company continually monitors historical sales trends as well as projected needs to ensure adequate on hand supplies of inventory and to ensure against overstocking of slower moving  obsolete items 
certain of the company s divisions maintain significant inventories of crts and component parts in an effort to ensure its customers a reliable source of supply 
the company s inventory turnover averages days  although in many cases the company would anticipate holding to days of inventory in the normal course of operations 
this level of inventory is higher than some of the company s competitors because it sells a number of products representing older  or trailing edge  technology that may not be available from other sources 
the market for these trailing edge technology products is declining and  as manufacturers for these products discontinue production or exit the business  the company may make last time buys 
in the monitor operations of the company s business  the market for its products is characterized by rapid change as a result of the development of new technologies  particularly in the flat panel display area 
if the company fails to anticipate the changing needs of its customers or accurately forecast their requirements  it may accumulate inventories of products which its customers no longer need and which the company will be unable to sell or return to its vendors 
the company s management monitors the adequacy of its inventory reserves regularly  and at february   believes its reserves to be adequate 
interest rate exposure the company had outstanding debt of approximately million and million  as of february  and  respectively  subject to interest rate fluctuations by the company s lenders 
variable interest rates on the company s loans and the potential for rate hikes could negatively affect the company s future earnings 
it is the intent of the company to continually monitor interest rates and consider converting portions of the company s debt from floating rates to fixed rates should conditions be favorable for such interest rate swaps or hedges 

table of contents operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentages that selected items in the company s consolidated statements of operations bear to total revenues amounts in thousands see item business description of principal business and principal products for discussion about the company s products and divisions 
amount amount net sales monitors data display crts entertainment crts component parts total company costs and expenses cost of goods sold selling and delivery general and administrative income from operations interest expense other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales consolidated net sales increased million or to million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the company s business is more concentrated in the monitor division of the company where all the new growth is occurring as the market for crts declines and moves to newer technologies 
the company is now a video display solutions company  while it still services the existing crt markets 
the monitor revenues increased million primarily due to long term contracts that began in the fourth quarter of the previous year and continued this fiscal year at aydin and display systems facilities 
z axis also experienced tremendous growth in its custom manufacturing and power supply sales due to new business 
overall z axis increased in net revenues 
lexel experienced a decline in revenues due to a decline in orders for various types of its crt business 
data display crt sales in fiscal declined due to decreased demand by the division s largest customer  sales with the customer are expected to increase in fiscal entertainment crt net sales declined million in fiscal compared to fiscal a significant portion of the entertainment division s sales are to major television retailers as replacements for products sold under manufacturer and extended warranties 
due to the continued shift to flat screen televisions  the market for replacement crts has diminished 
the company remains the primary supplier of product to meet manufacturers standard warranties 
future sales trends in this division will be negatively impacted 
table of contents by the decreasing number of extended warranties sold for larger  more expensive sets 
because the company is in the replacement market  it has the ability to track retail sales trends and  accordingly  has reduced its inventory for these types of crts 
components parts sales increased slightly from fiscal to fiscal component parts sales have generally declined in recent years due to weaker demand for electron gun and stem sales 
component parts sales have historically been dependent upon the demand by domestic and foreign television crt remanufacturers 
these sales have declined over the past few years as consumers move towards purchasing new technology as opposed to repairing existing sets 
this business will continue to decline as the crt industry moves to the new technologies 
the division primarily supplies the other divisions with parts they need to complete the assembly of their products 
gross margins consolidated gross margins decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal gross margins within the monitor division were flat in fiscal compared to fiscal there was an increase in material costs offset by a savings on the overhead expenses due to efficiencies of scale 
the product mix of the division changed due to increases in flat panel displays and custom manufacturing 
the margins for the monitor division are expected to improve as the divisions revenues increase and better efficiencies are achieved within their operations 
data display crt gross margins decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal this decrease in margins is primarily a result of product mix and quantity pricing on large orders 
gross margins in entertainment crts decreased in fiscal from the prior year due to the decrease in sales volume of high margin products at the company s louisiana facility and the decreased production at the chroma division 
these margins will continue to decline as these operations are liquidated 
gross margins from component parts decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal for its customers outside the company  primarily reflecting the decrease in need of its products outside the company 
operating expenses operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal primarily reflecting decreases in salaries  legal fees  research and development and professional services 
the company under took a cost cutting program to align its costs with its revenues 
the company expects to continue to control costs while growing its revenues in the coming year 
interest expense interest expense was flat at million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal the company maintains various debt agreements with different interest rates  most of which are based on the prime rate or libor 
the interest expense remained the same primarily reflected by the same levels of borrowings at similar interest rates in effect during fiscal and fiscal income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the higher effective rate in and lower effective rate in were primarily due to research and experimentation credits and various other permanent items 
foreign currency translation gains or losses resulting from the transactions with the company s uk subsidiary were reported in current operations while currency translation adjustments are recognized in a separate component of shareholders equity 
the company closed its operation in the uk and wrote off the foreign currency translation gain in fiscal discontinued operations on march   we sold our fox international ltd 
subsidiary to fi acquisitions  a company owned by video display s chief executive officer 
we accounted for this business as discontinued operations  and  
table of contents accordingly  we have reclassified the consolidated financial results for all periods presented to reflect them as such 
the loss from discontinued operations increased by in fiscal to million from million in fiscal see note discontinued operations liquidity and capital resources at february  and february   the company had total cash of million and million  respectively 
of the million on february   million was restricted cash 
the company s working capital was and million at february  and february   respectively 
in recent years  the company has financed its growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations  borrowings under revolving credit facilities  borrowings from its ceo and long term debt 
the company specializes in certain products representing trailing edge technology that may not be available from other sources  and may not be manufactured currently 
in many instances  the company s products are components of larger display systems for which immediate availability is critical for the customer 
accordingly  the company enjoys higher gross margins  but typically has larger investments in inventories than those of its competitors 
the company continually monitors its cash and financing positions in order to find ways to lower its interest costs and to produce positive operating cash flow 
the company examines possibilities to grow its business through internal sales growth or niche acquisitions 
there could be an impact on working capital requirements to fund this growth 
as in the past  the intent is to finance such projects with operating cash flows or existing bank lines  however  more permanent sources of capital may be required in certain circumstances 
cash provided by operations was million in fiscal and million in fiscal of this  million increase was due to the operating activities of the company due primarily to the net income of million  the provision for inventory reserves of million  loss from discontinued operations of million and depreciation and amortization of million 
during fiscal  net working capital items were flat due to a decrease in accounts payable of that resulted from the company becoming current with its vendors as operations improved 
other items that negatively affected net working capital were an increase in refundable income taxes of million and an increase in prepaid expenses of million 
these were offset by decreases in inventory of million  in costs and estimated earnings and billings on contracts of million and a decrease in accounts receivable of million operating activities in fiscal provided only million 
investing activities used cash of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the purchase of a letter of credit for million and capital expenditures were million offset by million on the proceeds from the sale of equipment in fiscal capital expenditures were million in fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal were primarily for expansion at the company s z axis facility  which used million of the total spent in fiscal expenditures in fiscal were for general maintenance requirements and computer hardware 
additionally  the company used million for a license agreement offset by million gain in equity securities in fiscal the company does not anticipate significant investments in capital assets for fiscal beyond normal maintenance requirements 
financing activities used cash of million in fiscal primarily for paying down debt 
during fiscal  the company used cash for the repurchase of common stock of  borrowed a net amount of from related parties  and used cash for the net repayment of debt of to outside parties 
on december   the company and its subsidiaries executed a new credit agreement with rbc bank and community southern bank collectively  the banks to provide new financing to the company to replace the existing credit agreement with rbc bank that terminated in conjunction with this agreement 
the new agreement provided for a line of credit of up to million and two term loans of million and million 
the outstanding balance at february  of the line of credit was million and the balances of the term loans were million and million  respectively 
a copy of the new credit agreement was filed an k document with the securities and exchange commission on december  these loans are secured by all assets and personal property of the company and a limited guarantee of the chief executive officer of million 
the million term loan is secured by real estate property of the company including a building owned by the company s fox international subsidiary 
the fox international subsidiary was sold to fi acquisitions on march  see note subsequent events  a company owned by the chief executive officer and the building will continue to be in the collateral pool until such time as the note is sufficiently paid down or it is replaced by other collateral 
the agreement contains three covenants a fixed charge coverage ratio  ratio of senior funded debt to ebitda ratio  and total liabilities to tangible net worth 
the agreement also includes restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt or liens  investments including company stock  divestitures and certain other changes in the 
table of contents business 
the agreement expires on december  the interest rate on these loans is a floating libor rate based on a fixed charge coverage ratio  minimum  as defined in the loan documents 
as of february   the company was not in compliance with the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio or the senior funded debt to ebitda ratio as defined by the rbc and community southern bank credit line agreements 
the company subsequently received a waiver of these covenant violations from rbc bank and community southern bank through the july  reporting of the next measurement of these covenants as of the company s first quarter end 
additionally  rbc bank and community southern bank have amended the credit agreement to reduce the revolver commitment to million  restate the covenants to pertain to only continuing operations of the company and to adjust the targets for the senior debt to cash flow covenant for the company s quarters ending may  and august  this covenant was deemed to be the most restrictive by the company and the banks 
management believes based on their projections  the company will be able to meet the new covenants and be in compliance under the new loan agreements 
the company has a stock repurchase program  pursuant to which it was originally authorized to repurchase up to  shares of the company s common stock in the open market 
on july   the board of directors of the company approved a one time continuation of the stock repurchase program  and authorized the company to repurchase up to  additional shares of the company s common stock  depending on the market price of the shares 
there is no minimum number of shares required to be repurchased under the program 
during the fiscal year ended february   the company repurchased  shares at an average price of per share  which were added to treasury shares on the consolidated balance sheet 
under this program  an additional  shares remain authorized to be repurchased by the company at february  as discussed in note  the loan and security agreement executed by company on december  included restrictions on investments that restricted further repurchases of stock under this program

critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements 
these consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the accounting policies that may involve a higher degree of judgments  estimates  and complexity include reserves on inventories  the allowance for bad debts  contract revenue recognition as well as profitability or loss recognition estimates and warranty reserves 
the company uses the following methods and assumptions in determining its estimates reserves on inventories reserves on inventories result in a charge to operations when the estimated net realizable value declines below cost 
management regularly reviews the company s investment in inventories for declines in value and establishes reserves when it is apparent that the expected net realizable value of the inventory falls below its carrying amount 
management attempts to determine by historical usage analysis and numerous other market factors  the projected demand for crts in this estimate of net realizable value 
management is able to identify consumer buying trends  such as size and application  well in advance of supplying replacement crts 
thus  the company is able to adjust inventory stocking levels according to the projected demand 
the average life of a crt is five to seven years  at which time the company s replacement market develops 
management reviews inventory levels on a quarterly basis 
such reviews include observations of product development trends of the oem s  new products being marketed and technological advances relative to the product capabilities of the company s existing inventories 
there have been no significant changes in management s estimates in fiscal and  however  the company cannot guarantee the accuracy of future forecasts since these estimates are subject to change based on market conditions 
the reserve for inventory obsolescence was approximately million and million at february  and february   respectively 
during fiscal and  the company disposed of million and million of inventory  respectively  that had previously been reserved 

table of contents revenue and profit or loss recognition revenues are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the price has been fixed or is determinable and collect ability can be reasonably assured 
the company s delivery term typically is fob shipping point 
in accordance with fasb asc topic revenue recognition principal agent considerations  shipping and handling fees billed to customers are classified in net sales in the consolidated statements of income 
shipping and handling costs incurred for the delivery of product to customers are classified in selling and delivery in the consolidated statements of income 
a portion of the company s revenue is derived from contracts to manufacture display systems to a buyer s specifications 
these contracts are accounted for under the provisions of fasb asc topic revenue recognition construction type and production type contracts 
these contracts are fixed price and cost plus contracts and are recorded on the percentage of completion basis using the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion as the measurement basis for progress toward completion and revenue recognition 
any losses identified on contracts are recognized immediately 
contract accounting requires significant judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract costs and making related assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
with respect to contract change orders  claims  or similar items  judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable 
allowance for bad debts the allowance for bad debts is determined by reviewing all accounts receivable and applying credit loss experience to the current receivable portfolio with consideration given to the current condition of the economy  assessment of the financial position of the creditors as well as payment history and overall trends in past due accounts compared to established thresholds 
the company monitors credit exposure and assesses the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts on a regular basis 
historically  the company s allowance has been sufficient for any customer write offs 
although the company cannot guarantee future results  management believes its policies and procedures relating to customer exposure are adequate 
warranty reserves the warranty reserve is determined by recording a specific reserve for known warranty issues and a reserve based on claims experience 
the company considers actual warranty claims compared to net sales  then adjusts its reserve liability accordingly 
actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserve 
management feels that historically its procedures have been adequate and does not anticipate that its assumptions are reasonably likely to change in the future 
other loss contingencies other loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can reasonably be estimated 
disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded provision 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties 
discontinued operations on march   the company sold its fox international ltd 
subsidiary to fi acquisitions  a company majority owned by the company s chief executive officer 
the company put its fox international ltd 
subsidiary up for auction on january  and gave all interested parties a thirty day due diligence period  which was later extended until march   to give any potential bidders more time 
fi acquisitions was the only bidder and paid the net book value  approximately million  for fox international ltd 
in a stock sale  satisfied by the company s chief executive officer exchanging  of his personally owned shares of the company s stock valued at approximately million and approximately  in cash 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued revised guidance fasb asu  fair value measurements and disclosures overall subtopic subtopic to improve disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued revised guidance fasb asu  when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
the amendments modify step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in making that determination  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that impairment may exist 
the amendments are effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning january  and are not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued guidance fasb asu  disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
this guidance specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s 
table of contents that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the guidance also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
this guidance is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our footnote disclosures for our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued an exposure draft of a proposed accounting standards update of topic  revenue recognition 
the proposed guidance specifies the principles that an entity would apply to report useful information about the amount  timing  and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from its contracts to provide goods or services to customers 
in summary  the core principle would require an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer or goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that it receives  or expects to receive  in exchange for those goods or services 
in august  the fasb issued an exposure draft of a proposed accounting standards update of topic  leases 
this exposure draft proposes that lessees and lessors should apply a right of use model in accounting for all leases including leases of right of use assets in a sublease other than leases of biological and intangible assets  leases to explore for or use natural resources and leases of some investment properties 
this exposure draft also proposes disclosures based on stated objectives  including disclosures about the amounts recognized in the financial statements arising from leases and the amount  timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from those contracts 
impact of inflation inflation has not had a material effect on the company s results of operations to date 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and variability in interest rate spread relationships  such as prime to libor spreads 
approximately million of outstanding debt at february  related to long term indebtedness under variable rate debt 
interest on the outstanding balance of this debt will be charged based on a variable rate related to the prime rate or the libor rate 
both rate bases are incremented for margins specified in their agreements 
thus  the company s interest rate is subject to market risk in the form of fluctuations in interest rates 
the effect of a hypothetical one percentage point increase across all maturities of variable rate debt would result in a decrease of approximately  in pre tax income assuming no further changes in the amount of borrowings subject to variable rate interest from amounts outstanding at february  the company does not trade in derivative financial instruments
