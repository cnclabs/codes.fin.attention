except as expressly required by the federal securities laws  we undertake no obligation to update such factors or to publicly announce the results of any of the forward looking statements contained herein to reflect future events  developments  or changed circumstances  or for any other reason 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k and item a  risk factors 

index management s discussion and analysis is presented in the following order overview revenues and expenses results of operations liquidity and capital resources material off balance sheet arrangements critical accounting policies overview our solutions are designed to help solve some of the toughest challenges in health information exchange today  such as the incorporation of medical images and diagnostic information into broader healthcare it applications  the interoperability of proprietary software solutions  advanced clinical tools like computer aided detection cad  the profitability of outpatient imaging practices in the face of declining reimbursement and the ability to improve the efficiency and cost effectiveness of our customers businesses 
our proven ability to innovate has driven consistent expansion of solutions and services and entry into new markets 
we currently own approximately patents which are used across a wide variety of clinical specialties in addition to being an increasing important component of clinical trials 
we will also look to expand through strategic acquisitions that will allow us to further expand our addressable market and customer base 
during the last two years  we have expanded our product offerings through the following strategic acquisitions the first three of which we also refer to as significant acquisitions amicas  inc amicas  an image and information management solutions provider  which we acquired on april   confirma  inc confirma  a provider of computer systems for processing and presenting data from magnetic resonance imaging mri studies  which we acquired on september  upon completion of the acquisition  this legal entity was renamed merge cad  etrials worldwide  inc etrials  a provider of clinical trials software and services  which we acquired on july  upon completion of the acquisition  this legal entity was renamed merge eclinical  and seven other acquisitions  five of which were completed in on april   we completed our acquisition of amicas through a successful tender offer for  outstanding shares of common stock of amicas at per share in cash 
following the tender offer  we purchased the remaining shares pursuant to a merger of a subsidiary of merge with and into amicas 
total transaction consideration was approximately million 
in addition  shortly before the completion of the acquisition  amicas paid cash to holders of vested  in the money stock options for the difference between per share and the exercise price of such options 
the holders of shares of restricted stock were paid per share in cash 
the total consideration paid to option and restricted stockholders was approximately million 
we financed the transaction with million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due notes  cash already available at the two companies and proceeds of million from the issuance of preferred and common stock 
see notes   and for further information regarding these transactions 
we primarily generate revenue from the sale of perpetual software licenses  upgrading and or renewing those licenses  hardware  professional services and maintenance 
except for maintenance  these contract elements comprise the majority of non recurring revenue 
our backlog of non recurring revenue was approximately million as of december  maintenance  which we renew annually with our substantial customer base  is the primary component of recurring revenues 
recurring revenue also includes software licenses sold through contracts that are annually renewed and recognized ratably over the annual period and recorded as software revenue  revenues derived from saas offerings which are recorded as professional services revenue and electronic data interchange edi revenues which are recognized based on monthly transactional volumes 
we continue to generate recurring revenue annually that exceeds of total net sales 

index our solutions optimize processes for healthcare organizations ranging in size from single doctor practices to health systems  for the sponsors of clinical trials  for the medical device industry  for the healthcare commerce system and for consumers of healthcare 
these solutions are licensed by more than  hospitals   clinics and labs  oem customers and of the top pharmaceutical companies 
we have a significant opportunity to grow revenues by expanding our solution footprint in existing customers  as only a small percent currently have more than one of our solutions 
this is supported by the fact that no customer accounted for more than of our net sales in any of the last three years 
with the benefit of a broad customer base and several product lines undergoing ongoing innovation  we also believe that we are well positioned to continue to leverage technologies into new segments where customers see value 
for example  as providers adopt ehrs and seek to qualify for meaningful use incentives  our vendor neutral archiving and web based image access products allow us to capitalize on these opportunities 
in order to take advantage of these opportunities  we began aggressively hiring sales and marketing personnel in the fourth quarter of we continue these hiring efforts today 
our market and challenges that we face we have provided a detailed assessment of the healthcare information technology market under part i  item  healthcare it industry 
during the period between the announcement of our bid to acquire amicas and the closing of the transaction  certain of our customers were uncertain regarding our go forward corporate and product strategy  which we believe is a common issue when a public company acquires a perceived competitor 
this resulted in weakness in our net sales for the second quarter of however  immediately following the closing of the acquisition  we began a proactive communication effort with customers in order to share and validate our corporate strategy and product roadmap 
in addition  we realigned our business from a decentralized organizational structure into a centralized organizational structure with functional leaders 
we believe that centralizing functions will have a long term positive effect on our ability to efficiently develop products to address market needs 
based on discussions held with current and potential customers and the operating results for the third and fourth quarters of  we believe that our customers understand and support our corporate and product strategies 
revenues and expenses the following is a brief discussion of our revenues and expenses net sales net sales consist of software and other sales  net of estimated returns and allowances  including software and purchased component revenue recognized in sales to oem customers  healthcare facilities and other healthcare providers  professional services  including hosted clinical trial saas offerings  installation  custom engineering services  training  consulting and project management  and maintenance and edi  including software maintenance and support and edi revenues 
cost of sales cost of sales consists of software and other cost of sales  including purchased components and third party royalties included in software and hardware sales to our customers  professional services cost of sales  including headcount and related costs and direct third party costs incurred in our performance of saas offerings  installation  custom engineering services  training  consulting and project management  maintenance and edi cost of sales  including headcount and related costs and direct third party costs incurred to fulfill our maintenance and support obligations and to deliver edi services  and depreciation and amortization  including any impairment  for amounts assessed on capital equipment used to fulfill contract obligations as well as our purchased and developed software and backlog assets 
depreciation and amortization are recorded over the respective asset s useful life 
each quarter we test our purchased and developed software for impairment by comparing its net realizable value estimated using undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the software 
if the carrying value of the software exceeds its net realizable value  we record an impairment charge in the period in which the impairment is incurred equal to the amount of the difference between the carrying value and estimated undiscounted future cash flows 

index sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense includes the costs of our sales and marketing departments  commissions and costs associated with trade shows 
research and development expense research and development expense consists of expenses incurred for the development of our proprietary software and technologies 
the costs reflected in this category are reduced by capitalized software development costs 
the amortization of capitalized software development costs and any related impairments are included in cost of sales 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense includes costs for information systems  accounting  administrative support  management personnel  bad debt expense  legal fees and general corporate matters 
acquisition related expenses acquisition related expenses are costs incurred to effect business combinations  including banking  legal  accounting  valuation and other professional or consulting fees

depreciation  amortization and impairment depreciation and amortization  including any impairment  is assessed on capital equipment  leasehold improvements and our customer relationships  trade names and non compete agreement intangible assets 
depreciation and amortization are recorded over the respective asset s useful life 
we also record impairment of these long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based primarily upon whether expected future undiscounted cash flows are sufficient to support recovery of the assets 
other income expense other income expense is comprised of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalent balances  interest expense and amortization of costs and discounts incurred from borrowings 
it also includes foreign exchange gains or losses on foreign currency payables and receivables at our nuenen  netherlands branch and at our subsidiaries located in europe  canada and china 
in addition  we also record any other than temporary impairment charges recognized on our equity investments in non public companies in other income expense 
results of operations the following have significantly impacted the results of operations for the periods discussed herein completion of the significant acquisitions  of which the results of operations are included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations since the respective dates of acquisition 
as result of the timing of the significant acquisitions  the comparability of the results of operations in the year ended december  differs significantly from the same period in in addition  as a result of the amicas transaction  we incurred significant acquisition related expenses in the year ended december  we issued million of notes in april as part of the financing for the acquisition of amicas 
the notes were issued at of the principal amount  are due in and bear interest at of principal payable on may st and november st of each year 
in connection with the notes  we incurred issuance costs of million 
the year ended december  includes approximately eight months of interest expense and amortization of the original issuance discount and costs of the notes 
in november  we sold million shares of common stock in a registered direct offering for aggregate net proceeds of million which we used to repay a then existing million note payable at interest 
this note payable was originally issued at a discount and had issuance costs  both of which were being amortized over the life of the note payable 
concurrent with the acquisition of amicas  we completed a restructuring initiative in april we also completed a restructuring activity in july concurrent with the acquisition of etrials 
both of these initiatives assisted in providing operational rigor to a combined  larger organization and enabled us to decrease costs as a percentage of revenue most notably general and administrative costs 
the full impact of cost saving benefits of the april initiative is reflected in the operating results for the fourth quarter of 
index year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the following table sets forth selected  summarized  consolidated financial data for the periods indicated  as well as comparative data showing increases and decreases between the periods

index gross margin professional services sales 
gross margin on professional service sales was million in  an increase of million  or  from million in gross margin as a percentage of professional service sales decreased to in from in  primarily due to the impact of our significant acquisitions

gross margin maintenance and edi sales 
gross margin on maintenance and edi sales was million in  an increase of million  or  from million in gross margin as a percentage of maintenance and edi sales decreased to in from in  primarily due to the impact of the amicas acquisition as such services include more third party maintenance costs 
further  prior to the acquisition of amicas  we did not have significant edi sales

depreciation  amortization and impairment expenses are excluded from these gross margin calculations 
net sales software and other sales 
total software and other sales in were million  an increase of million  or  from million in  primarily due to the fact that sales were negatively affected in because of customer concerns with our financial viability 
we believe that these concerns were alleviated with the financing transaction completed in june 
index professional services sales 
total professional service sales in were million  an increase of million  or  from million in  due to million of sales from our merge eclinical business  which was acquired in july this increase was offset by a decrease of million due to the decline in the number of custom engineering services projects in  primarily the result of the reluctance of oem customers to start new projects in the uncertain economic environment as well as a shift in our strategic focus towards selling software solutions to such customers 
maintenance sales 
total maintenance sales in were million  an increase of million  or  from million in the increase is primarily due to million of merge cad maintenance sales from the date of its acquisition 
gross margin gross margin software and other sales 
gross margin on software and other sales was million in  an increase of million  or  from million in gross margin as a percentage of software and other sales increased to in from in  primarily due to a decrease in hardware sales  which are at a lower margin than software only sales

we experienced a million decrease in canadian related costs due to the strengthening of the average exchange rate for the u 
s dollar compared to the canadian dollar in primarily in the first half of 
product research and development product research and development expense decreased million  or  to million in from million in salaries and related expenses including travel and entertainment and third party costs decreased by million due to restructuring and subsidiary disposal activities  offset by an increase of million due to acquisitions 
also  canadian related costs decreased million due to strengthening of the average exchange rate for the us dollar compared to the canadian dollar

we also recorded a million charge in related to a change in estimate associated with subleasing a facility 

index depreciation  amortization and impairment depreciation  amortization and impairment expense decreased million  or  to million in from million in  as a result of a million impairment of fixed assets held for sale in and a million decrease in depreciation due to assets being disposed of or becoming fully depreciated 
these decreases are offset by an increase of million of depreciation and amortization resulting from fixed assets and intangible assets acquired in our acquisitions 
other income expense  net other income expense  net increased by approximately million  to million of net expense in from million of net expense in the net expense in is due to million of interest expense and amortization of issuance costs and note discount associated with a million note payable  a million loss on early extinguishment of the million note payable including a prepayment penalty of million and write off of million of remaining debt issuance costs and note discount and a realized loss of million related to the sale of an investment 
these expenses were offset by a million gain on the sale of certain patents that were no longer necessary to support our business and million in foreign currency exchange gains 
the net other expense in is primarily attributable to million of interest expense and amortization of issuance costs and note discount associated with a million note payable and a million impairment charge related to the investment which was sold in  offset by million in foreign exchange gains and million of interest income 
income tax benefit we recorded an income tax benefit resulting in an effective tax rate of in  compared to an effective rate of in our effective tax rates in and differ significantly from statutory rates primarily due to recording a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized 
our expected effective income tax rate is volatile and may move up or down with changes in  among other items  operating income and the results of changes in tax law and regulations of the us and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents were million at december   an increase of approximately million  or  from our balance of million at december  in addition  our working capital was million at december   an increase of million  or  from our working capital of million at december  on april   we completed our acquisition of amicas through the issuance of million of notes  cash already available at the two companies and proceeds of million from the issuance of preferred and common stock 
the net increase in cash and cash equivalents during the years ended december   and of million  million and million  respectively  is attributed to the following factors 
index year ended december  in millions cash received from paid for issuance of debt and equity principal payments on notes interest expense early retirement penalty on debt debt and equity issuance costs acquisitions restructuring initiatives acquisition related expenses property and equipment purchases sale of property other non operating cash flows core business operations increase in cash operating cash flows cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to cash used in operating activities of million in the net loss in of million includes non cash expenses of million and includes million in interest expense on our million of notes  of which million was paid on november  we also paid million in acquisition related expenses in compared to million in average quarterly dso in excluding the second quarter  as the calculation is not meaningful due to the timing of the amicas acquisition was days compared to a quarterly average of days in investing cash flows cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to cash used in investing activities of million in in  we paid million  net of cash acquired  for our acquisition of amicas 
we also paid million  net of cash acquired  for other acquisitions  offset by million in proceeds received from the sale of a facility 
financing cash flows in april  we issued  shares of preferred stock and  shares of common stock for million of proceeds received 
the preferred stock dividends accumulate at a rate of which compounds annually  but the timing of its payment is fully at our discretion 
in april  we also issued million of senior secured notes  net of a million discount 
in order to complete the stock and debt issuances  we paid million in issuance costs in we used the proceeds from the issuance of the notes  preferred and common stock to fund our acquisition of amicas 
contractual obligations total outstanding commitments as of december  in thousands  were as follows payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease capital lease including interest note payable including interest total the above obligations include lease payments involving facilities that we have either ceased to use or previously abandoned 
except for restricted cash of million primarily letters of credit related to our leased facilities and million related to an insignificant acquisition and a million guarantee to a lender on behalf of a customer of ours at december   we do not have any other significant long term obligations  contractual obligations  lines of credit  standby letters of credit  guarantees  standby repurchase obligations or other commercial commitments 

index general we believe our current cash and cash equivalent balances will be sufficient to meet our operating  financing and capital requirements through at least the next months  including interest payments due under the notes 
however  any projections of future cash inflows and outflows are subject to uncertainty 
in the event that it is necessary to raise additional capital to meet our short term or long term liquidity needs  such capital may be raised through additional debt  equity offerings or sale of certain assets 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity  equity related or debt securities  such securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
furthermore  the number of shares of any new equity or equity related securities that may be issued may result in significant dilution to existing shareholders 
in addition  the issuance of debt securities could increase the liquidity risk or perceived liquidity risk that we face 
we cannot  however  be certain that additional financing  or funds from asset sales  will be available on acceptable terms 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we will likely not be able to take advantage of opportunities  develop or enhance services or products or respond to competitive pressures 
any projections of future cash inflows and outflows are subject to uncertainty 
in particular  our uses of cash in and beyond will depend on a variety of factors such as the costs to implement our business strategy  the amount of cash that we are required to devote to defend and address any regulatory proceedings  and potential merger and acquisition activities 
material off balance sheet arrangements we have no material off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates  judgments  and assumptions made by management during their preparation 
we base our estimates and judgments on our experience  our current knowledge including terms of existing contracts  our beliefs of what could occur in the future  our observation of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following accounting policies and estimates as those that we believe are most critical to our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties revenue recognition  allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts  intangible assets and goodwill  share based compensation expense  income taxes  guarantees and loss contingencies 
revenue recognition revenues are derived primarily from the licensing of software  sales of hardware and related ancillary products  saas offerings  installation and engineering services  training  consulting  and software maintenance and edi 
inherent to software revenue recognition are significant management estimates and judgments in the interpretation and practical application of the complex rules to individual contracts 
these interpretations generally would not influence the amount of revenue recognized  but could influence the timing of such revenues 
in addition  revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from period to period 
significant areas of judgment include the determination of deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement and treatment as separate units of accounting  whether separate arrangements with the same customer executed within a short time frame of each other are a single arrangement  the assessment of the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer since we generally do not request collateral from customers  the determination of whether the fees are fixed and determinable  whether or not installation  engineering or consulting services are significant to the software licensed  and the amount of total estimated labor hours  based on management s best estimate  to complete a project we account for under the input method of percentage of completion accounting 
we review our contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract values and estimated labor hours  and reflect changes in estimates in the period that such estimates are revised under the cumulative catch up method 
typically  our contracts contain multiple elements  and while the majority of our contracts contain standard terms and conditions  there are instances where our contracts contain non standard terms and conditions 
as a result  contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting 
we analyze our multiple element arrangements to determine the vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of each element  the amount of revenue to be recognized upon shipment  if any  and the period and conditions under which deferred revenue should be recognized 
as a result  if facts and circumstances change that affect our current judgments  our revenue could be materially different in the future 

index allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns based upon past experience and judgment  we establish allowances for doubtful accounts related to our accounts receivable and customer credits with respect to our sales returns 
we determine collection risk and record allowances for bad debts based on the aging of accounts and past transaction history with customers 
in addition  our policy is to allow sales returns when we have preauthorized the return 
we have determined an allowance for estimated returns and credits based on our historical experience of returns and customer credits 
we monitor our collections  write offs  returns and credit experience to assess whether adjustments to our allowance estimates are necessary 
changes in trends in any of the factors that we believe impact the realizability of our receivables or modifications to our credit standards  collection  return and credit  authorization practices or other related policies may impact our estimates 
intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets include purchased technology  capitalized software  customer relationships  backlog  trade names  and non compete agreements 
finite lived intangible assets are amortized to reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed  which is primarily the straight line method 
purchased technology and capitalized software are tested for impairment quarterly by comparing the net realizable value estimated using undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the software 
if the carrying value of the software exceeds its net realizable value  we record an impairment charge in the period in which the impairment is incurred equal to the amount of the difference between the carrying value and estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
customer relationships  backlog  trade names and non compete agreements are evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  based primarily upon whether expected future undiscounted cash flows are sufficient to support the asset s recovery 
if the actual useful life of the asset is shorter than the useful life estimated by us  the asset may be deemed to be impaired  and  accordingly  a write down of the value of the asset determined by a discounted cash flow analysis  or a shorter amortization period  may be required 
we have reviewed these long lived assets with estimable useful lives and determined that their carrying values as of december  are recoverable in future periods 
we review goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
our policy provides that goodwill will be reviewed for impairment as of october st of each year 
in calculating potential impairment losses  we evaluate the fair value of goodwill using either quoted market prices or  if not available  by estimating the expected present value of their future cash flows 
identification of  and assignment of assets and liabilities to  a reporting unit require our judgment and estimates 
in addition  future cash flows are based upon our assumptions about future sales activity and market acceptance of our products 
if these assumptions change  we may be required to write down the gross value of our remaining goodwill to a revised amount 
we performed our goodwill testing and determined that there is no impairment as of december  during our review  we noted that the present value of expected future cash flows of our eclinical reporting unit exceeds the carrying value by less than 
the goodwill balance for this reporting unit is million as of december  the fair value of our other reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying value 
share based compensation expense we calculate share based compensation expense for option awards based on the estimated grant date fair value using the black scholes option pricing model  and recognize the expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period  net of estimated forfeitures 
the fair value of stock based awards is based on certain assumptions  including expected volatility  which we base on the historical volatility of our stock and other factors  and estimated option life  which represents the period of time the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based  in part  on historical data 
we also estimate employee terminations option forfeiture rate  which is based  in part  on historical data  employee class and the type of award 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value stock options and restricted stock awards on a quarterly basis 
the estimation of share based awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
although we believe our assumptions used to calculate share based compensation expense are reasonable  these assumptions can involve complex judgments about future events  which are open to interpretation and inherent uncertainty 
in addition  significant changes to our assumptions could significantly impact the amount of expense recorded in a given period 

index income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
our provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach for accounting for income taxes 
a current liability is recognized for the estimated taxes payable for the current year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the timing differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates or tax laws are recognized in the provision for income taxes in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized 
changes in valuation allowances will flow through the statement of operations unless related to deferred tax assets that expire unutilized or are modified through translation  in which case both the deferred tax asset and related valuation allowance are similarly adjusted 
where a valuation allowance was established through purchase accounting for acquired deferred tax assets  any future change will be credited or charged to income tax expense 
the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates  and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
in spite of our belief that we have appropriate support for all the positions taken on our tax returns  we acknowledge that certain positions may be successfully challenged by the taxing authorities 
we determine the tax benefits more likely than not to be recognized with respect to uncertain tax positions 
unrecognized tax benefits are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based upon new information  resolution with taxing authorities and expiration of the statute of limitations 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of changes in the liability for our uncertain tax positions 
although we believe our recorded tax assets and liabilities are reasonable  tax laws and regulations are subject to interpretation and inherent uncertainty  therefore  our assessments can involve both a series of complex judgments about future events and rely on estimates and assumptions 
although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable  the final determination could be materially different than that which is reflected in our provision for income taxes and recorded tax assets and liabilities 
guarantees we recognize the fair value of guarantee and indemnification arrangements issued or modified by us  as applicable 
in addition  we must continue to monitor the conditions that are subject to the guarantees and indemnifications in order to identify if a loss has occurred 
if we determine it is probable that a loss has occurred  then any such estimable loss would be recognized under those guarantees and indemnifications 
under our standard software license agreements  we agree to indemnify  defend and hold harmless our licensees from and against certain losses  damages and costs arising from claims alleging the licensees use of our software infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party 
historically  we have not been required to pay material amounts in connection with claims asserted under these provisions  and  accordingly  we have not recorded a liability relating to such provisions 
we also represent and warrant to licensees that our software products will operate substantially in accordance with published specifications  and that the services we perform will be undertaken by qualified personnel in a professional manner conforming to generally accepted industry standards and practices 
historically  only minimal costs have been incurred relating to the satisfaction of product warranty claims 
other guarantees include promises to indemnify  defend and hold harmless each of our executive officers  non employee directors and certain key employees from and against losses  damages and costs incurred by each such individual in administrative  legal or investigative proceedings arising from alleged wrongdoing by the individual while acting in good faith within the scope of his or her job duties on our behalf 
loss contingencies we have accrued for costs as of december  and may  in the future  accrue for costs associated with certain contingencies when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable 
liabilities established to provide for contingencies are adjusted as further information develops  circumstances change  or contingencies are resolved

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our cash and cash equivalents are exposed to financial market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates  which may affect our interest income 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents included money market funds and short term deposits  including certain cash that is restricted  totaling approximately million  and earned interest at a weighted average rate of in the value of the principal amounts is equal to the fair value for these instruments 
due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio  our interest income is subject to changes in short term interest rates 
at current investment levels  our pre tax results of operations would vary by approximately million for every basis point change in our weighted average short term interest rate 
we do not use our portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk we have sales and expenses in canada  china and europe that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and  as a result  have exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
in the event our exposure to foreign currency risk increases to levels that we do not deem acceptable  we may choose to hedge those exposures
