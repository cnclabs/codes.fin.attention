item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview our business strategy is to operate as a well capitalized and profitable financial institution dedicated to providing exceptional personal service to our customers 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement our business strategy 
since being organized in  we grew to become  prior to our initial public offering of stock in april  the nation s largest mutually owned savings and loan association based on total assets 
we credit our success to our continued emphasis on our primary values love  trust  respect  and a commitment to excellence  along with some fun 
our values are reflected in our pricing of loan and deposit products  and historically  in our home today program  as described below 
our values are further reflected in the broadway redevelopment initiative a long term revitalization program encompassing the three mile corridor of the broadway slavic village neighborhood in cleveland  ohio where our main office is located and the education programs we have established and or supported 
we intend to continue to support our customers 
while recent financial and economic reports have not been as consistently negative  and some positive trends have been highlighted in many current earnings reports  much of the financial services industry remains relatively fragile and susceptible to the consequences of adverse financial conditions 
regionally high unemployment  weak residential real estate values  capital and credit markets that remain at less than robust levels  and a general lack of confidence in the financial service sector of the economy present challenges for us 
management believes that the following matters are those most critical to our success controlling our interest rate risk exposure  monitoring and limiting our credit risk  maintaining access to adequate liquidity and alternative funding sources  and monitoring and controlling operating expenses 
controlling our interest rate risk exposure 
although housing and credit quality issues persist in financial headlines and continue to have a negative effect on our operating results and  as described below  are certainly a matter of significant concern for us  historically our greatest risk has been interest rate risk exposure 
when we hold long term  fixed rate assets  funded by liabilities with shorter re pricing characteristics  we are exposed to potentially adverse impact from rising interest rates 
generally  and particularly over extended periods of time that encompass full economic cycles  interest rates associated with longer term assets have been higher than interest rates associated with shorter term assets 
this difference has been an important component of our net interest income and is fundamental to our operations 
we manage the risk of holding long term  fixed rate mortgage assets by moderating the attractiveness of our loan offerings  thereby controlling the level of additions new originations to our portfolio  and  until recently  by periodically selling long term  fixed rate mortgage loans in the secondary market to reduce the amount of those assets held in our portfolio 
during the fiscal year ended september   we sold million of long term  fixed rate mortgage loans compared to billion and billion during the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively the low volume of loan sales since september  reflects the impact of changes by fannie mae  historically the association s primary loan investor  related to requirements for loans that it accepts and a reduced level of fixed rate loan originations as described below 
effective july   fannie mae  historically the association s primary loan investor  implemented certain loan origination requirement changes affecting loan eligibility that  to date  we have not adopted 
in reaching our current decision regarding implementation of the changes necessary to comply with fannie mae s revised requirements  we considered that since  the association  employing only non commissioned loan originators and utilizing a centralized underwriting process  has sold loans to fannie mae under a series of proprietary variances  or contract waivers  that were negotiated between us and fannie mae during the term of our relationship 
these proprietary concessions related to certain loan file documentation and quality control procedures that  in our opinion  did not diminish in any way the excellent credit quality of the loans that we delivered to fannie mae  but facilitated the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations and the quality and value of the loan products that we were able to offer to our borrowers 
the credit quality of the loans that we delivered to fannie mae was consistently evidenced by the superior delinquency profile of our portfolio in peer performance comparisons prepared by fannie mae throughout the term of our relationship 
in response to the tumult of the housing crisis that commenced in  and with the objective of improving the credit profile its loan portfolio  fannie mae has enacted many credit tightening measures  culminating in the effective elimination of proprietary variances and waivers  accompanied by the imposition of additional file documentation requirements and expanded quality control procedures 
in addition to substantively changing fannie mae s operating environment  effects of the housing crisis spread throughout the secondary residential mortgage market and resulted in a significantly altered operating framework for all secondary market participants 
we believe that this dramatically altered operating framework offers opportunities for business process innovators to create new secondary market solutions especially as such opportunities pertain to high credit quality residential loans similar to those that we have traditionally originated 
with the current uncertainty as to how the secondary market might be structured in the future  the association has concluded that it is premature to incur the costs of the infrastructural changes to our operations file documentation collection and additional quality control procedures that would be necessary to fully comply with current fannie mae loan eligibility standards 
in the near term  the association expects to monitor secondary market developments and will continue to assess the merits of implementing the changes required to comply with fannie mae s loan eligibility standards 
as a result  the association s ability to reduce interest rate risk via our traditional loan sales of newly originated longer term fixed rate residential loans is limited until either the association changes its loan origination processes or fannie mae  freddie mac or other market participants revise their loan eligibility standards 
in the absence of such changes  future sales of fixed rate mortgage loans will be predominantly limited to those loans that have established payment histories  strong borrower credit profiles and are supported by adequate collateral values 
in that regard  in june  we sold  on a servicing retained basis  million of fixed rate mortgage loans to a private investor 
also  in response to the agencies loan eligibility changes  in july we began marketing an adjustable rate mortgage loan product that provides us with improved interest rate risk characteristics when compared to a long term  fixed rate mortgage 
since its introduction  the smartrate adjustable rate mortgage has offered borrowers an interest rate lower than that of a fixed rate loan 
the rate is locked for three or five years then resets annually after that 
it contains a feature to relock the rate an unlimited number of times at our then current rate and fee schedule  for another three or five years dependent on the original reset period without having to complete a full refinance transaction 
relock eligibility is subject to satisfactory payment performance history by the borrower never days late  no day delinquencies during the last twelve months  current at the time of relock  and no foreclosures or bankruptcies since the smartrate application was taken 
in addition to a satisfactory payment history  relock eligibility requires that the property continue to be the borrower s primary residence 
the loan term cannot be extended in connection with a relock nor can new funds be advanced 
all interest rate caps and floors remain as originated 
during the fiscal year ended september  adjustable rate mortgage loan production increased million to billion from million during the fiscal year ended september  during the same time period  fixed rate mortgage loan production decreased million to million from billion 
the amount of origination and refinancing volumes along with the portion of that activity that pertains to loans that we previously sold but for which we maintained the right to provide mortgage servicing so as to maintain our relationship with our customer when coupled with the level of loan sales  if any  determines the balance of loans held on our balance sheet 
the amount of adjustable rate loan activity described above resulted in billion of long term adjustable rate loans in our residential mortgage loans held for investment portfolio at september   as compared to million at september   or an increase of million during the fiscal year 
in addition  fixed rate mortgage loan activity described above resulted in billion of long term fixed rate loans in our residential mortgage loans held for investment portfolio at september   as compared to billion at september  in the past  we have also managed interest rate risk by promoting home equity lines of credit which have a variable interest rate 
as described below  this product carries an incremental credit risk component and has been adversely impacted by the housing market downturn 
effective june   we suspended the acceptance of new home equity credit applications with the exception of bridge loans and  in accordance with a reduction plan that was accepted by our primary regulator in december  we actively pursued strategies to decrease the outstanding balance of our home equity lending portfolio as well as our exposure to undrawn home equity lines of credit 
during the quarter ended june   we achieved the balance and exposure reduction targets included in the reduction plan 
notwithstanding achievement of the reduction plan target  promotion of this product is not a current strategy used to manage our interest rate risk profile 
should a rapid and substantial increase occur in general market interest rates  it is probable that  prospectively and particularly over a multi year time horizon  the level of our net interest income would be adversely impacted 
monitoring and limiting our credit risk 
while  historically  we had been successful in limiting our credit risk exposure by generally imposing high credit standards with respect to lending  the confluence of unfavorable regional and macro economic events since  coupled with our pre expanded participation in the second lien mortgage lending markets  has significantly refocused our attention with respect to credit risk 
in response to the evolving economic landscape  we have continuously revised and updated our quarterly analysis and evaluation procedures  as needed  for each category of our lending with the objective of identifying and recognizing all appropriate credit impairments 
at september   of our assets consisted of residential real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit  the overwhelming majority of which were originated to borrowers in the states of ohio and florida 
our analytic procedures and evaluations include specific reviews of all home equity loans and lines of credit that become or more days past due  as well as specific reviews of all first mortgage loans that become or more days past due 
we also expanded our analysis of current performing home equity lines of credit to better mitigate future risk of loss 
in response to current market conditions  and in an effort to limit our credit risk exposure and improve the credit performance of new customers  we have tightened our credit criteria in evaluating a borrower s ability to successfully fulfill his or her repayment obligation and we have revised the design of many of our loan products to require higher borrower down payments  limited the products available for condominiums  and eliminated certain product features such as interest only adjustable rate loans  loans above certain loan to value ratios  and home equity lending products with the exception of bridge loans 
prior to its merger into the office of the comptroller of the currency occ on july   the office of thrift supervision ots expressed concerns with the risk concentration and other aspects of the association s home equity loans and lines of credit portfolio and the administration of that portfolio 
under the terms of an august  memorandum of understanding the mou between the association and the ots  management prepared  or obtained  and submitted to the ots a third party report on our home equity lending portfolio  a home equity lending reduction plan the reduction plan  enhanced home equity lending and credit risk management policies and procedures  and an updated business plan 
on december   notice was received from the ots that it did not object to the reduction plan 
the reduction plan spans the period from june  through december  as of september   the reduction plan targets a billion reduction in home equity lending commitments  including a million reduction in outstanding balances had been met and exceeded as home equity lending commitments had been reduced by billion  including million in outstanding balances 
other elements of the reduction plan include a million capital infusion from the company to the association  which was completed in october   and implementation of expanded line management  account management and collection processes regarding home equity lending 
these process changes continue to be implemented and are in various stages of completion 
further  the ratio of the association s home equity loans and lines of credit portfolio and open commitments relative to tier capital  plus the allowance for loan losses  was reduced to at september  from at september  the december  targeted ratio as contained in the reduction plan is 
effective february   the mou was terminated and replaced by new memorandums of understanding the new mou covering the association  third federal savings  mhc and the company 
the new mou addressed the ongoing monitoring of issues raised in the original mou 
in addition  the new mou required  at various dates through september   the following actions  all of which we have performed an independent assessment of the association s interest rate risk management policy and a plan to address any deficiencies the assessment was submitted to the ots on february   an independent review of management compensation the review was submitted to the ots on june   the submittal of an independent enterprise risk management study and a plan to address any deficiencies the study and plan to address deficiencies was submitted to the ots on february   the submittal for ots non objection days in advance of any plans for new debt  dividends or stock repurchases  formal management and director succession plans these plans were submitted to the ots on march  and april   respectively  and revisions to various operational policies each of which has been completed 
in a self initiated effort  and prior to receipt of the new mou  in september  we engaged a third party to conduct an independent assessment of our interest rate risk management policy and our enterprise risk management approach 
as indicated above  just days after receipt of the new mou  the assessments were submitted to the ots 
as a result of the assessments  we are installing a new interest rate risk model to provide more customized analysis and we have established new board and management level committees to govern and oversee risk management and compliance 
as indicated above  we believe that to date  we have complied with all of the stipulations of the mou and new mou 
the requirements of the mou and new mou carry costs to complete which will continue to increase our non interest expense in amounts that are not expected to  but may  be material to our results of operations 
the company does not intend to declare or pay a cash dividend  or to repurchase any of its outstanding common stock until the concerns of our regulators are resolved 
the requirements of the new mou will remain in effect until our primary regulator decides to terminate  suspend or modify them 
one aspect of our credit risk concern relates to the high percentage of our loans that are secured by residential real estate in the states of ohio and florida  particularly in light of the difficulties that have arisen with respect to the real estate markets in those states 
at september   approximately and of our residential  non home today and construction loans were secured by properties in ohio and florida  respectively 
our or more days delinquency ratios on those loans in ohio and florida at september  were and  respectively 
our or more days delinquency ratio for the non home today portfolio as a whole was 
also  at september   approximately and of our home equity loans and lines of credit were secured by properties in ohio and florida  respectively 
our days or more delinquency ratios on those loans in ohio and florida at september  were and  respectively 
our or more days delinquency ratio for the home equity loans and lines of credit portfolio as a whole was 
while we focus our attention on  and are concerned with respect to the resolution of  all loan delinquencies  as these ratios illustrate  our highest concern is centered on loans that are secured by properties in florida 
the allowance for loan losses portion of the preceding part i  item  business section provides extensive details regarding our loan portfolio composition  delinquency statistics  our methodology in evaluating our loan loss provisions and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
as long as unemployment levels remain high  particularly in ohio and florida  and florida housing values remain depressed  due to prior overbuilding and speculation which has resulted in considerable inventory on the market  we expect that we will continue to experience elevated levels of delinquencies and risk of loss 
our residential home today loans are another area of credit risk concern 
although the recorded investment in these loans totals million at september  and constitutes only of our total loan portfolio balance  these loans comprise and of our days or greater delinquencies and our total delinquencies  respectively 
at september   approximately and of our residential  home today loans were secured by properties in ohio and florida  respectively 
at september   the percentages of those loans delinquent days or more in ohio and florida were and  respectively 
the disparity between the portfolio composition ratio and delinquency composition ratio reflects the nature of the home today loans 
prior to march  these loans were made to customers who  generally because of poor credit scores  would not have otherwise qualified for our loan products 
we do not offer  and have not offered  loan products frequently considered to be designed to target sub prime borrowers containing features such as higher fees or higher rates  negative amortization  or low initial payment features with adjustable interest rates 
our home today loan products  which prior to march  were made to borrowers whose credit profiles might be described as sub prime  generally contain the same features as loans offered to our non home today borrowers 
the overriding objective of our home today lending  just as it is with our non home today lending  is to create successful homeowners 
we have attempted to manage our home today credit risk by requiring that borrowers attend pre and post borrowing financial management education and counseling and that the borrowers be referred to us by a sponsoring organization with which we have partnered 
further  to manage the credit aspect of these loans  inasmuch as the majority of these buyers do not have sufficient funds for required downpayments  many loans include private mortgage insurance 
at september   of home today loans included private mortgage insurance coverage 
from a peak recorded investment of million at december   the total recorded investment balance of the home today portfolio has declined to million at september  this trend generally reflects the evolving conditions in the mortgage real estate market and the tightening of standards imposed by issuers of private mortgage insurance 
as part of our effort to manage credit risk  effective march   the home today underwriting guidelines were revised to be substantially the same as our traditional mortgage product 
inasmuch as most potential home today customers do not have sufficient funds for required downpayments  the lack of available private mortgage insurance restricts our ability to extend credit 
unless and until lending standards and private mortgage insurance requirements loosen  we expect the home today portfolio to continue to decline in balance 
maintaining access to adequate liquidity and alternative funding sources 
for most insured depositories  customer and community confidence are critical to their ability to maintain access to adequate liquidity and to conduct business in an orderly fashion 
the company believes that maintaining high levels of capital is one of the most important factors in nurturing customer and community confidence 
accordingly  we have managed the pace of our growth in a manner that reflects our emphasis on high capital levels 
at september   the association s ratio of core capital to adjusted tangible assets a basic industry measure under which is deemed to represent a well capitalized status was 
we expect to continue to maintain high capital ratios 
in managing its level of liquidity  the company monitors available funding sources  which include attracting new deposits  borrowing from others  the conversion of assets to cash and the generation of funds through profitable operations 
the company has traditionally relied on retail deposits as its primary means in meeting its funding needs 
at september   deposits totaled billion  while borrowings totaled million and borrowers advances and servicing escrows totaled million  combined 
in evaluating funding sources  we consider many factors  including cost  duration  current availability  expected sustainability  impact on operations and capital levels 
to attract deposits  we offer our customers attractive rates of return on our deposit products 
our deposit products typically offer rates that are highly competitive with the rates on similar products offered by other financial institutions 
we intend to continue this practice 
we preserve the availability of alternative funding sources through various mechanisms 
first  by maintaining high capital levels  we retain the flexibility to increase our balance sheet size without jeopardizing our capital adequacy 
effectively  this permits us to increase the rates that we offer on our deposit products thereby attracting more potential customers 
second  we pledge available real estate mortgage loans and investment securities with the federal home bank of cincinnati fhlb and the federal reserve bank of cleveland federal reserve 
at september   these collateral pledge support arrangements provide for additional borrowing capacity of up to billion with the fhlb provided an additional investment in fhlb capital stock of up to million is made and up to million at the federal reserve 
third  we invest in high quality marketable securities that exhibit limited market price variability  and to the extent that they are not needed as collateral for borrowings  can be sold in the institutional market and converted to cash 
at september   our investment securities portfolio totaled million 
fourth  cash flows from operating activities have been a regular source of funds 
during the fiscal years ended september   and  cash flows from operations totaled million  million and million  respectively 
cash flow from operations during the fiscal year ended september  was adversely affected by the million prepayment of federal deposit insurance corporation fdic deposit insurance assessments made in december  which has a remaining balance of million at september  finally  historically  a portion of the residential first mortgage loans that we originated were considered to be highly liquid as they were eligible for sale delivery to fannie mae 
however  due to delivery requirement changes imposed by fannie mae  effective july   this channel of available liquidity has been significantly reduced 
refer to the residential real estate mortgage loans section in part i  item  business for additional details 
there were no mortgage loans held for sale or loan sales commitments at september  while periodically  in conjunction with continuing negotiations with fannie mae  we may determine that certain loans may qualify for delivery to fannie mae  there is no certainty that such negotiations will prove to be successful 
while we feel this could adversely affect our liquidity position  we believe that it would be short term 
should we elect to do so  we have the ability to originate mortgages that would conform to the fannie mae selling guide requirements and would be eligible for delivery to fannie mae 
overall  while customer and community confidence can never be assured  the company believes that our liquidity is adequate and that we have adequate access to alternative funding sources 
monitoring and controlling operating expenses 
we continue to focus on managing operating expenses 
our annualized ratio of non interest expense to average assets was for the fiscal year ended september  and for the fiscal year ended september  as of september   our average assets per full time employee  and our average deposits per full time employee were million and million  respectively 
based on industry statistics published by the office of thrift supervision as of june   we believe that each of these measures compares favorably with the averages for our peer group 
our average deposits held at our branch offices million per branch office as of september  contribute to our expense management efforts by limiting the overhead costs of serving our deposit customers 
we will continue our efforts to control operating expenses as we grow our business 
while we devote a great deal of our attention to managing our operating expenses  certain costs are largely outside of our control 
one expense that increased dramatically beginning in fiscal is our fdic deposit insurance premiums and assessments 
in november  the fdic amended its assessment regulations to require insured institutions to pay  on december   their estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of calendar and to also prepay their estimated risk based assessments for all of the calendar years  and our required million prepayment was determined based upon our assessment rate in effect on september  and reflected a presumed annualized growth factor applied to the institution s assessment base as well as an assumed assessment rate increase of three cents per of deposits effective january  in recognition of the industry s weakened condition and the significant losses experienced by the fdic  the prepayment was intended to preclude additional special assessments for the foreseeable future  however  the prepayment does not preclude the fdic from changing assessment rates or from revising the risk based assessment system  pursuant to the existing notice and comment rulemaking framework 
as more fully described in part i item business supervision and regulation federal banking regulation insurance of deposit accounts the dodd frank act required that the fdic to revise its assessment system to base it on each institution s total assets less tangible capital of each institution instead of deposits 
changes pursuant to this requirement were implemented april   and resulted in a reduction in the association s assessment rate 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the most critical accounting policies upon which our financial condition and results of operations depend  and which involve the most complex subjective decisions or assessments  are our policies with respect to our allowance for loan losses  mortgage servicing rights  income taxes  pension benefits and stock based compensation 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to absorb credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the balance sheet date 
the amount of the allowance is based on significant estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or conditions change 
the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting policy by management due to the high degree of judgment involved  the subjectivity of the assumptions used and the potential for changes in the economic environment that could result in changes to the amount of the recorded allowance for loan losses 
at september   the allowance for loan losses was million or of total loans 
an increase or decrease of in the allowance would result in a million charge or credit  respectively  to income before income taxes 
as a substantial percentage of our loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate  appraisals of the underlying value of property securing loans are critical in determining the amount of the allowance required for specific loans 
assumptions are instrumental in determining the value of properties 
overly optimistic assumptions or negative changes to assumptions could significantly affect the valuation of a property securing a loan and the related allowance determined 
management carefully reviews the assumptions supporting such appraisals to determine that the resulting values reasonably reflect amounts realizable on the related loans 
management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
we consider a variety of factors in establishing this estimate including  but not limited to  current economic conditions  delinquency statistics  geographic concentrations  the adequacy of the underlying collateral  the financial strength of the borrower  results of internal loan reviews and other relevant factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates by management that may be susceptible to significant change based on changes in economic and real estate market conditions 
historically  the evaluation has been comprised of a specific component and a general component 
the specific component relates to loans that are delinquent or otherwise identified as a problem loan through the application of our loan review process and our loan grading system 
all such loans are evaluated individually  with principal consideration given to the value of the collateral securing the loan 
specific allowances have been established as required by this analysis 
the general component is determined by segregating the remaining loans by type of loan  risk weighting if applicable and payment history 
we also analyze historical loss experience  delinquency trends  general economic conditions and geographic concentrations 
beginning in september  a portion of the sva was reclassified as individually allocated gva 
this portion represents the allowance on individually reviewed loans dependent on cash flows  such as performing tdrs  and a portion of the allowance on loans that represents further deterioration in the fair value not supported by an appraisal 
refer to the allowance for loan losses section in part i  item  business third federal savings and loan association of cleveland lending activities  for additional details 
effective march   loss factors used in determining an appropriate allowance level are supplemented by a market valuation allowance that addresses more qualitative factors that impact potential losses 
the conditions evaluated include a combination of various market conditions  mainly a decrease in home values and an increase in unemployment rates  which have caused higher delinquencies and charge offs in the loan portfolio  and increased foreclosure rates 
this analysis establishes factors that are applied to the loan groups to determine the amount of the general component of the allowance for loan losses 
in the quarter ended december   a one time loan charge off of svas will be made by the company when it adopts the occ methodology regarding loan impairments 
refer to the allowance for loan losses section in part i  item  business third federal savings and loan association of cleveland lending activities  for additional details 
actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowances we have established  which could have a material negative effect on our financial results 
mortgage servicing rights 
mortgage servicing rights represent the present value of the estimated future servicing fees expected to be received pursuant to the right to service loans in our loan servicing portfolio 
mortgage servicing rights are recognized as assets for both purchased rights and for the allocated value of retained servicing rights on loans sold 
the most critical accounting policy associated with mortgage servicing is the methodology used to determine the fair value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights 
a number of estimates affect the capitalized value and include the mortgage loan prepayment speed assumption  the estimated prospective cost expected to be incurred in connection with servicing the mortgage loans  and the discount factor used to compute the present value of the mortgage servicing right 
the mortgage loan prepayment speed assumption is significantly affected by interest rates 
in general  during periods of falling interest rates  mortgage loans prepay faster and the value of our mortgage servicing assets decreases 
conversely  during periods of rising rates  the value of mortgage servicing rights generally increases due to slower rates of prepayments 
the estimated prospective cost expected to be incurred in connection with servicing the mortgage loans is deducted from the retained gross mortgage loan interest rate less amounts remitted to third parties investor pass thru rate  guarantee fee  mortgage insurance fee  etc 
servicing fee to determine the net servicing fee for purposes of capitalization computations 
to the extent that prospective actual costs incurred to service the mortgage loans differ from the estimate  our future results will be adversely or favorably impacted 
the discount factor selected to compute the present value of the servicing right reflects expected marketplace yield requirements 
the amount and timing of mortgage servicing rights amortization is adjusted monthly based on actual results 
in addition  on a quarterly basis  we perform a valuation review of mortgage servicing rights for potential decreases in value 
this quarterly valuation review entails applying current assumptions to the portfolio classified by interest rates and  secondarily  by prepayment characteristics 
at september   the capitalized value of our right to service billion of loans for others was million  or of the serviced loan portfolio 
income taxes 
we consider accounting for income taxes a critical accounting policy due to the subjective nature of certain estimates that are involved in the calculation 
we use the asset liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
we must assess the realization of the deferred tax asset and  to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
adjustments to increase or decrease the valuation allowance are charged or credited  respectively  to income tax expense 
during the fiscal year ended september   we increased the required deferred tax valuation allowance with respect to the expected carry forward portion of our million charitable contribution expense incurred in april in conjunction with the formation of the third federal foundation from million to million 
although we have determined a valuation allowance is not required for any other deferred tax assets  there is no guarantee that those assets  nor the portion of deferred tax asset associated with the carryforward of our charitable contribution not subject to a valuation allowance  will be recognizable in the future 
pension benefits 
the determination of our obligations and expense for pension benefits is dependent upon certain assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
key assumptions used in the actuarial valuations include the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation 
actual results could differ from the assumptions and market driven rates may fluctuate 
significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in the assumptions could materially affect future pension obligations and expense 
stock based compensation 
we recognize the cost of associate and director services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards in accordance with fasb asc  compensation stock compensation 
we estimate the per share value of option grants using the black scholes option pricing model using assumptions for expected dividend yield  expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and expected option term 
these assumptions are subjective in nature  involve uncertainties  and therefore  cannot be determined with precision 
the per share value of options is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions 
in general  the per share fair value of options will move in the same direction as changes in the expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and expected option term  and in the opposite direction from changes in expected dividend yield 
for example  the per share fair value of options will generally increase as expected stock volatility increases  risk free interest rate increases  expected option term increases and expected dividend yield decreases 
the use of different assumptions or different option pricing models could result in materially different per share fair values of options 
comparison of financial condition at september  and total assets decreased million  or  to billion at september  from billion at september  this change was the result of decreases in our cash and cash equivalents  investment securities and mortgage loans held for sale partially offset by an increase in our loan portfolio 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million  or  to million at september  from million at september   as we have reinvested our most liquid assets into loan products 
investment securities held to maturity decreased million  or  to million at september  from million at september  there were no sales of investment securities as million in principal paydowns occurred in this mortgage backed security portfolio partially offset by million in purchases of investment securities in the fiscal year ended september  during the first half of the fiscal year  we experienced higher paydowns on mortgage backed securities as historically low levels of mortgage loan interest rates motivated borrowers to refinance their existing mortgage debt  which reduced the balance of our portfolio of investment securities held to maturity 
during the second half of fiscal  reduced mortgage lending activity triggered a slower pace of paydowns 
there were no mortgage loans held for sale at september  compared to million at september  effective july   fannie mae  the association s primary loan investor  implemented certain loan origination requirement changes affecting loan eligibility 
we did not adopt those changes and as a result  the volume of loans sold since july  as well as the balance of loans held for sale declined 
refer to the controlling our interest rate risk exposure section of the overview discussion found earlier in this item during the quarter ended december   million of mortgage loans previously classified as held for sale were transferred to held for investment 
loans held for investment  net  increased million  or  to billion at september  from billion at september  residential mortgage loans increased million  or  to billion during fiscal year ended september  reflecting the successful marketing of our smartrate adjustable rate first mortgage loan product 
during the fiscal year ended september   billion of three and five year smartrate loans were originated while million of and year  fixed rate first mortgage loans were originated 
these originations were partially offset by paydowns and  with respect to fixed rate loans  to a much lesser extent  loan sales 
historically  the preponderance of our new loan originations was comprised of fixed rate loans which were frequently offset by fixed rate loan sales 
in the current fiscal year  sales of loans all fixed rate totaled million 
the low volume of loan sales since september  reflects the impact of changes  as described above  by fannie mae  the association s primary loan investor  related to requirements for loans that it accepts  as well as the strategy of originating adjustable rate loans to be held for investment on our balance sheet 
however  in june  we sold  on a servicing retained basis  million of fixed rate mortgage loans to a private investor 
refer to the controlling our interest rate risk exposure section of the overview for additional discussion regarding our management of interest rate risk 
the increase in residential mortgage loans was partially offset by a million decrease in home equity loans and lines of credit 
effective june   we suspended the acceptance of new equity credit applications with the exception of bridge loans 
refer to the monitoring and limiting our credit risk section of the overview for additional information 
mortgage loan servicing assets  net  decreased million  or  to million at september  from million at september  this net change reflects the significant reduction in loan sales  and accompanying creation of new mortgage loan servicing assets  that resulted from the delivery requirement changes imposed by fannie mae and as described above 
for the fiscal year ended september  mortgage loan servicing asset amortization totaled million while asset generation from new sales totaled thousand 
the majority of the amortization is linked to the cyclically low level of mortgage interest rates that prompted accelerated refinance activity by borrowers  particularly during the first six months of fiscal deposits decreased million  or  to billion at september  from billion at september  the decrease in deposits was the result of a million decrease in our certificates of deposit partially offset by a million increase in our high yield savings accounts a subcategory of our savings accounts combined with a million increase in our high yield checking accounts a subcategory of our negotiable order of withdrawal accounts during the fiscal year ended september  in the current environment of extremely low interest rates  our customers have demonstrated a preference for the liquidity of transaction oriented accounts and have moved away from the term commitments required of certificates of deposits 
we believe that our high yield savings accounts as well as our high yield checking accounts provide a stable source of funds 
in addition  our high yield savings accounts are expected to reprice in a manner similar to our equity loan products  and  therefore  assist us in managing interest rate risk 
borrowed funds increased million  or  to million at september  from million at september  the largest component of the increase is million of short term overnight borrowings from the federal home loan bank of cincinnati  the proceeds of which are held in interest bearing cash equivalents and augment our liquidity 
principal  interest  and related escrow owed on loans serviced decreased million  or  to million at september  from million at september  principal and interest collected decreased million along with a million decrease in retained tax payments collected from borrowers in the current period 
principal and interest will fluctuate based on normal curtailments and paydowns  but historically low mortgage interest rates increased the amount of refinancing activity in the periods preceding september  continuing through fiscal  especially in the first half  resulting in an increase in funds collected from borrowers which were being held on september   pending remittance to other investors 
as a result of the aforementioned activity and the low volume of loan sales in the current fiscal year  the principal balance of loans serviced decreased billion  or  to billion from billion at september  accrued expenses and other liabilities decreased million to million at september  from million at september  this change primarily reflects the in transit status of million of real estate tax payments that have been collected from borrowers and are being remitted to various taxing agencies  a million decrease in the accruals related to our retirement and pension plans and a million decrease in other payables 
shareholders equity increased million  or  to billion at september  from billion at september  activity reflects million of net income in the fiscal year combined with million of adjustments related to the allocation of shares of our common stock related to awards under the stock based compensation plan and the esop and a million reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss that resulted primarily from an adjustment to the actuarially determined balance of our pension obligation 
analysis of net interest income net interest income represents the difference between income we earn on our interest earning assets and the expense we pay on our interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income depends on the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the rates earned on such assets and the rates paid on such liabilities 
average balances and yields 
the following table sets forth average balances  average yields and costs  and certain other information at and for the fiscal years indicated 
no tax equivalent yield adjustments were made  as the effect thereof was not material 
average balances are derived from daily average balances 
non accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances  but have been reflected in the table as loans carrying a zero yield 
the yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees  discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or interest expense

net interest earning assets represent total interest earning assets less total interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin represents net interest income divided by total interest earning assets 
rate volume analysis 
the following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the fiscal years indicated 
the rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior volume 
the volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate 
the net column represents the sum of the prior columns 
for purposes of this table  changes attributable to both rate and volume  which cannot be segregated  have been allocated proportionately  based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume

net income decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  compared to million for the fiscal year ended september  this change was attributed to a decrease in non interest income combined with an increase in non interest expense partially offset by an increase in net interest income and a decrease in the provision for loan losses 
interest income 
interest income decreased million or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in interest income resulted primarily from decreases in interest income from loans and mortgage backed securities 
interest income on mortgage backed securities decreased million  or  to million from million during the prior fiscal year 
the average yield on mortgage backed securities decreased basis points to compared to in the prior fiscal year as interest rates on adjustable rate securities reset to lower current rates and higher  fixed rate securities continue to experience accelerated paydowns 
the average balance of mortgage backed securities decreased million to million compared to million during the prior fiscal year 
the million in principal paydowns and maturities which occurred in the current fiscal year were partially offset by million in purchases 
there were no sales of mortgage backed securities during the current fiscal year 
interest income on loans decreased million  or less than  to million compared to million compared to the prior fiscal year 
this change was attributed to a basis point decrease in the yield to from as historically low interest rates have increased the amount of refinance activity 
additionally  the increase in our smartrate adjustable rate first mortgage loan originations during the fiscal year at interest rates below rates offered on fixed rate products contributed to the lower average yield 
the decrease in interest income on loans during the current fiscal year was partially offset by the million increase in the average balance of loans to billion in the current fiscal year compared to billion in the prior fiscal year as new loan production exceeded repayments and loan sales 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million during the fiscal year from million during the fiscal year 
the change resulted primarily from a decrease in interest expense on certificates of deposit combined with modest decreases in now accounts and savings accounts 
interest expense on certificates of deposit decreased million  or  to million compared to million during the prior fiscal year 
the change was attributed to a basis point decrease in the average rate we paid on certificates of deposit to from combined with a million  or  decrease in the average balance to billion from billion 
rates were adjusted on deposits in response to changes in general market rates as well as to changes in the rates paid by our competition on short term certificates of deposit 
interest expense on savings accounts decreased million  or  to million compared to million the prior fiscal year 
the change was attributed to a basis point decrease in the average rate we paid on savings accounts to from  partially offset by a million  or a  increase in the average balance to billion from billion the prior fiscal year  reflecting customer preference for savings accounts when rates are comparable to our short term certificates of deposit 
net interest income 
net interest income increased million  or  to million compared to million during the prior fiscal year 
as net interest income increased during the current fiscal year  we experienced an improvement of our interest rate spread which increased basis points to compared to during the prior fiscal year 
our net interest margin increased basis points to compared to in the prior fiscal year 
this increase can be partially attributed to the higher average loan balance in the current fiscal year 
our average net interest earning assets increased million  to billion during the current fiscal year compared to billion during the prior fiscal year 
provision for loan losses 
we establish provisions for loan losses  which are charged to operations  in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level we consider necessary to absorb credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the balance sheet date 
in determining the level of the allowance for loan losses  we consider past and current loss experience  evaluations of real estate collateral  current economic conditions  volume and type of lending  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay a loan and the levels of non performing and other classified loans 
the amount of the allowance is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or conditions change 
we assess the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and make provisions for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance 
continuing economic issues  including high levels of unemployment  are challenging our borrowers ability to repay their loans at a time when housing prices are weak  in part as a consequence of the collapse of the sub prime mortgage market  and make it difficult to sell their homes 
this limits the ability of many borrowers to self cure a delinquency 
based on our evaluation of the above factors  we recorded a provision for loan losses of million during the fiscal year ended september  and a provision of million during the prior fiscal year 
the lower provision in fiscal reflects the overall stabilization of credit quality in our loan portfolio 
the provisions recorded exceeded net charge offs of million and million for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
our provisions for loan losses continue to exceed the total of charge offs  adjusted for the net change in specific valuation allowances  and as a result  our combined general and market valuation allowances have continued to increase 
the current provision reflects our net charge off experience  lower home values and the uncertain economic times  which continue to challenge many of our loan customers 
as delinquencies in the portfolio have been resolved through pay off  short sale or foreclosure  or management determines the collateral is not sufficient to satisfy the loan  uncollected balances have been charged against the allowance for loan losses previously provided 
the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total recorded investment in loans receivable  at september   compared to million or of total recorded investment in loans receivable at september  of the million decrease in the recorded investment of non accrual loans from september to september  the largest decrease was in our residential home today portfolio  which decreased million  or to million 
as of september   the recorded investment in our home today portfolio was million  compared to million at september  the million balance in home today non accrual loans includes million in troubled debt restructurings which are current but included with non accrual loans for a minimum period of six months from their restructuring date 
the recorded investment in non accruing home equity loans and lines of credit decreased million  or  during the current fiscal year ending september  during the current fiscal year  net charge offs of million of uncollected balances have been charged against the allowance for loan losses 
as of september   the recorded investment in our home equity loans and lines of credit portfolio was billion  compared to billion at september  we believe that non performing home equity loans and lines of credit are  on a relative basis  of greater concern than non home today loans as these home equity loans and lines of credits generally hold subordinated positions and accordingly  represent a higher level of risk 
the non performing balances of home equity loans and lines of credit were million or of the home equity loans and lines of credit portfolio at september  compared to million or at september  in light of the depressed housing market in our primary geographic markets and the continued high level of delinquencies in our portfolio  we will continue to closely monitor the loss performance of this category 
the recorded investment in non accrual loans in our residential  non home today portfolio decreased million or to million at september  during the current fiscal year  net charge offs of million of uncollected balances were charged against the allowance for loan losses 
the million balance includes million in troubled debt restructurings which are current but included with non accrual loans for a minimum period of six months from their restructuring date 
we believe we have recorded all losses that are both probable and reasonable to estimate for fiscal years ended september  and we used the same general methodology in assessing the allowance at the end of each period  except that  beginning september   the individual loan loss review methodology applied to home equity loans and lines of credit was enhanced to include updated individual reviews for all home equity loans and lines of credit that were days or more past due 
previously  updated individual reviews were not performed if the previous review had been performed within the last months 
refer to item business for additional discussion and disclosure related to our provisions for loan losses 
non interest income 
non interest income decreased million  or  to million during the current fiscal year compared to million during the prior fiscal year 
in the fiscal year ended september  there were million in loan sales from which we recorded thousand of net gains compared to net gains of million on million in loan sales in prior fiscal year 
the significantly lower volume of loan sales in the current fiscal year reflects the impact of changes by fannie mae related to requirements for loans that it accepts 
refer to the controlling our interest rate risk exposure section of the overview for additional discussion 
loan fees and service charges decreased million  or  to million during the current fiscal year compared to million during prior fiscal year 
this change is attributed to reduced loan servicing fees in the current fiscal year as the balance of our portfolio of sold loans we are servicing for others has decreased from september  resulting in a million decrease in loan servicing fees collected in the current period compared to the fiscal year ended september  the decrease in the portfolio of sold loans we are servicing for others can be attributed to the increased paydowns in addition to the significantly lower volume of loan sales 
non interest expense 
non interest expense increased million  or  to million during fiscal year compared to million during fiscal year  primarily from increases in appraisal and other loan review expenses  real estate owned expense associated legal cost and losses on the disposition of properties and other operating expenses partially offset by a decrease in salaries and employee benefits 
salaries and employee benefits decreased million  or  to million during the current fiscal year compared to million during the prior fiscal period 
this change was primarily due to a million decrease in associate compensation costs particularly bonus accruals and costs related to employee stock based incentive programs  and a million decrease in defined benefit retirement plan expense resulting primarily from the correction of an actuarial error 
as a result of the freeze to the defined benefit retirement plan accruals  subsequent to september   net periodic benefit cost recognized in the statement of income will be significantly reduced after december  offsetting a portion of that decrease will be a future benefit contribution attributable to employees impacted by the freeze  as they will become eligible for the third tier of benefits under the k savings plan after december  for additional detail regarding the defined benefit plan  see the defined benefit plan section of note appraisal and other loan review expenses increased million to million during the current fiscal year compared to million during the prior fiscal year 
these costs along with other costs included in other operating expenses legal  postage  courier  telephone etc 
are associated with our home equity lending reduction plan 
additionally  professional consulting fees incurred in connection with the enhancement of our home equity lending account administration and account management activities coupled with similar fees incurred in connection with an independent evaluation of our enterprise risk management processes and procedures also contributed to the cost increase 
finally  because of the higher loan refinance activity during the fiscal year  the cost of interest advances that the company is required to make and which is included in other operating expenses when serviced loans are repaid prior to month end increased million in the current fiscal year when compared to the prior fiscal year 
income tax expense 
the provision for income taxes was million during the current fiscal year compared to million during the prior fiscal year 
the provision for the current fiscal year included million of federal tax and thousand of state income tax expense 
the provision for fiscal year ended included million of federal income tax provision and thousand of state income tax provision 
the state income tax provision is subtracted from income before income taxes when calculating the federal income tax provision 
our effective federal tax rate was in the current fiscal year compared to for the prior fiscal year 
the primary difference in the effective tax rate this fiscal year when compared to the prior fiscal year is the result of the million adjustment to increase our deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to our charitable contribution carryforward that was recognized during the fiscal year ended september  as compared to an adjustment of thousand recognized during the fiscal year ended september  our effective federal income tax rate was affected by insurance related permanent tax differences which had a more beneficial impact during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to lower pre tax earnings 
comparison of operating results for the fiscal years ended september  and general 
net income decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  compared to million for the fiscal year ended september  this change was attributed to decreases in both net interest income and non interest income partially offset by a decrease in the provision for loan losses 
interest income 
interest income decreased million or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in interest income resulted primarily from decreases in interest income from loans and mortgage backed securities 
interest income on mortgage backed securities decreased million  or  to million from million during the prior fiscal year 
the average yield on mortgage backed securities decreased basis points to compared to in the prior fiscal year as interest rates on adjustable rate securities reset to lower current rates and higher  fixed rate securities experienced accelerated paydowns 
the average balance of mortgage backed securities decreased million to million compared to million during the prior fiscal year 
the million in purchases which occurred in fiscal were partially offset by million in principal paydowns and maturities 
there were no sales of mortgage backed securities during fiscal interest income on loans decreased million  or  to million from million when compared to the prior fiscal year 
historically low interest rates can be attributed to a basis point decrease in the yield to from 
in addition  the average balance of loans decreased million to billion compared to billion in the prior fiscal year as repayments exceeded sales and new loan production 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million during the fiscal year from during the fiscal year 
the change resulted primarily from a decrease in interest expense on certificates of deposit combined with modest decreases in now accounts and savings accounts 
interest expense on now accounts  which include our high yield checking accounts  decreased million  or  to million from million during the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was caused primarily by a basis point decrease in the average rate we paid on now accounts to during the fiscal year ended compared to during the fiscal year ended we decreased rates on deposits in response to decreases in short term market interest rates 
in addition  the average balance of now accounts decreased million  or  to million compared to billion as many customers moved funds into the higher yields offered by certificates of deposit and our high yield savings accounts 
interest expense on savings accounts  which include our high yield savings accounts  decreased million  or  to million from million during the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was caused by a basis point decrease in the yield to compared to  and was largely offset by the change in the average balance of savings accounts which increased million  or  to billion during fiscal interest expense on certificates of deposit decreased million  or  to million from million during the prior fiscal year 
the change was attributed to a basis point decrease in the average rate we paid on certificates of deposit to from partially offset by a million  or  increase in the average balance to billion from billion as some customers were attracted to the certainty of yields provided by certificates of deposit 
rates were adjusted on deposits in response to changes in general market rates as well as to changes in the rates paid by our competition on short term certificates of deposit 
net interest income 
net interest income decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
while net interest income decreased  we experienced an improvement of our interest rate spread  which increased basis points to compared to 
our net interest margin decreased four basis points to compared to for fiscal year our average net interest earning assets decreased million  to billion during fiscal compared to billion during the prior fiscal year 
provision for loan losses 
we establish provisions for loan losses  which are charged to operations  in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level we consider necessary to absorb credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the balance sheet date 
in determining the level of the allowance for loan losses  we consider past and current loss experience  evaluations of real estate collateral  current economic conditions  volume and type of lending  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay a loan and the levels of non performing and other classified loans 
the amount of the allowance is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or conditions change 
we assess the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and make provisions for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance 
current economic issues  including high levels of unemployment  are challenging our borrowers ability to repay their loans at a time when housing prices are weak  in part as a consequence of the collapse of the sub prime mortgage market  and make it difficult to sell their homes 
this limits the ability of many borrowers to self cure a delinquency 
based on our evaluation of the above factors  we recorded a provision for loan losses of million during the fiscal year ended september  and a provision of million during the prior fiscal year 
the provisions recorded exceeded net charge offs of million and million for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
the level of charge offs in the portfolio remained elevated 
as delinquencies in the portfolio have been resolved through pay off  short sale or foreclosure  or management determines the collateral is not sufficient to satisfy the loan  uncollected balances have been charged against the allowance for loan losses previously provided 
the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans receivable  at september   compared to million or of total loans receivable at september  of the million increase in non accrual loans from september to september   the largest increase was in our residential non home today portfolio  which increased million  or 
non accrual loans in our residential  non home today portfolio at september   include million in troubled debt restructurings which are current but included with non accrual loans for a minimum period of six months from their restructuring date 
the increase in our residential  non home today portfolio was general in nature and reflective of the general market conditions with specific negative implications in the housing markets of our primary geographic operating areas 
while the increase in non accrual loans is noteworthy  as a percentage of the balance of our non home today portfolio  the non accruing loan balance of million is 
non accrual loans in our home today portfolio increased million  or  during fiscal as of september   our home today portfolio was million  compared to million at september  these non accrual loans include million in trouble debt restructurings which were current but included with non accrual loans for a minimum period of six months from their restructuring date 
the increase in non accruing loans has been taken into account in determining our provision for loan losses 
non accruing home equity loans and lines of credit decreased million  or  during fiscal ending september  during fiscal  net charge offs of million of uncollected balances have been charged against the allowance for loan loss 
as of september   our home equity loans and lines of credit portfolio was billion  compared to billion at september  we believe that non performing home equity loans and lines of credit are  on a relative basis  of greater concern than non home today loans as these home equity loans and lines of credits generally hold subordinated positions and accordingly  represent a higher level of risk 
the non performing balances of home equity loans and lines of credit were million or of the home equity loans and lines of credit portfolio at september  compared to million or at september  non interest income 
non interest income decreased million  or  to million during fiscal compared to million during the prior fiscal year 
net gain on the sale of loans decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million during the prior fiscal year 
this can be attributed to favorable market conditions lower and declining interest rates generally result in higher gains on sales of loans partially offset by a billion decrease in loan sales to billion as compared to billion during the prior fiscal year 
loan sales are used by the company as a means of managing interest rate risk 
however  due to delivery requirement changes imposed by fannie mae  effective july   we expect that our ability to reduce interest rate risk via the loan sales channel will be limited 
refer to the controlling our interest rate risk exposure section of the overview discussion found earlier in this item non interest expense 
non interest expense of million in fiscal year was essentially unchanged from the prior fiscal year 
an increase in salaries and employee benefits was offset by decreases in real estate owned expense  office property  equipment and software and marketing services 
salaries and employee benefits increased million or  to million during fiscal year from million during the prior fiscal year 
compensation expense increased million or to million during fiscal this change is due to normal annual compensation increases for our associates combined with lower compensation expense deferrals that resulted from the reduction in the volume of loan originations during fiscal when compared to the prior fiscal year 
defined benefit plan expense increased million of  to million from million during the prior fiscal year as a result of changes in the net periodic benefit cost recognized in fiscal for additional detail regarding the change in the defined benefit plan see the defined benefit plan section of note real estate owned expense decreased million or  to million from million 
the change is due to a million decrease in net losses taken on the sale of reo properties during fiscal income tax expense 
the provision for income taxes was million during fiscal compared to million during the prior fiscal year 
the provision for income taxes included million and million in federal income taxes during the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
the state income tax provision is subtracted from income before income taxes when calculating the federal income tax provision 
our effective tax rate was in fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year 
the primary difference in the effective tax rate in fiscal when compared to the prior fiscal year is the result of a million adjustment to increase our deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to our charitable contribution carryforward 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short term nature 
our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments  advances from the fhlb of cincinnati  borrowings from the federal reserve discount window and maturities  sales of securities and  historically  sales of loans 
in addition  we have the ability to obtain collateralized borrowings in the wholesale markets 
finally  access to the equity capital markets via a supplemental first step transaction or a full second step transaction remain as other potential source of liquidity  although this channel generally requires six to nine months of lead time while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the association s asset liability management committee is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawals of our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies 
we seek to maintain a minimum liquidity ratio of or greater which we compute as the sum of cash and cash equivalents plus unpledged investment securities for which ready markets exist  divided by total assets 
for the fiscal year ended september   our liquidity ratio averaged 
we believe that we have enough sources of liquidity to satisfy our short and long term liquidity needs as of september  we regularly adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demand  expected deposit flows  yields available on interest earning deposits and securities and the objectives of our asset liability management program 
excess liquid assets are generally invested in interest earning deposits and short and intermediate term securities 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents 
the levels of these assets are dependent on our operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at september   cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
during the fiscal year ended september   we sold million of long term  fixed rate loans 
effective july  however  our traditional underwriting procedures no longer comply with fannie mae s standard requirements and accordingly  our ability to manage liquidity via the loan sales channel will be limited until either we change our underwriting standards or fannie mae  or other market participants  revise their qualification standards 
in the absence of such changes  future sales of fixed rate mortgage loans will be limited to those loans that have established payment histories  strong borrower credit profiles and are supported by adequate collateral values 
investment securities classified as available for sale  which provide additional sources of liquidity  totaled million at september  also  at september  we had borrowed million from the fhlb of cincinnati 
our cash flows are derived from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows included in the consolidated financial statements 
at september   we had million in loan commitments outstanding 
in addition to commitments to originate loans  we had billion in unused lines of credit to borrowers 
certificates of deposit due within one year of september  totaled billion  or of total deposits 
if these deposits do not remain with us  we will be required to seek other sources of funds  including loan sales  sales of investment securities  other deposit products  including certificates of deposit  federal home loan bank advances  borrowings from the federal reserve discount window or other collateralized borrowings 
depending on market conditions  we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before september  we believe  however  based on past experience that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us 
generally  we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered 
our primary investing activities are originating residential mortgage loans and purchasing investments 
during the fiscal year ended september   we originated billion of loans  and during the fiscal year ended september   we originated billion of loans 
we purchased million of securities during the fiscal year ended september   and million during the fiscal year ended september  financing activities consist primarily of changes in deposit accounts  changes in the balances of principal and interest owed on loans serviced for others and  to a lesser extent  federal home loan bank advances and borrowings from the federal reserve discount window 
we experienced a net decrease in total deposits of million during the fiscal year ended september  compared to a net increase of million during the fiscal year ended september  deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by us and our local competitors  and by other factors 
principal and interest owed on loans serviced for others decreased million during the fiscal year ended september  compared to an increase of million during the fiscal year ended september  liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
if we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  borrowing agreements exist with the fhlb of cincinnati and the federal reserve discount window  each of which provides an additional source of funds 
at september  we had million of fhlb of cincinnati advances and no outstanding borrowings from the federal reserve discount window 
during the fiscal year ended september   we had average outstanding advances with the fhlb of cincinnati of million as compared to average outstanding advances of million from the fhlb of cincinnati during fiscal year at september  we had the ability to immediately borrow an additional million from the fhlb of cincinnati and million from the federal reserve discount window 
from the perspective of collateral value securing fhlb of cincinnati advances  our capacity limit for additional borrowings at september  was billion  subject to satisfaction of the fhlb cincinnati common stock ownership requirement 
to satisfy the common stock ownership requirement we would have to increase our ownership of fhlb cincinnati common stock by an additional million 
third federal savings and loan is subject to various regulatory capital requirements  including a risk based capital measure 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories 
at september   third federal savings and loan exceeded all regulatory capital requirements 
third federal savings and loan is considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
the net proceeds from the stock offering significantly increased our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal our financial condition and results of operations have been enhanced by the net proceeds from the stock offering  and have resulted in increased net interest earning assets and net interest income during the periods following completion of the offering in april however  due to the increase in equity that resulted from the net proceeds of our stock offering  our return on equity ratios have been adversely affected and can be expected to continue to be so affected prospectively 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations commitments 
as a financial services provider  we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risks  such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit 
while these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements  a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans we make 
in addition  we routinely enter into commitments to securitize and sell mortgage loans 
for additional information  see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations 
in the ordinary course of our operations  we enter into certain contractual obligations 
such obligations include operating leases for premises and equipment  agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities and agreements with respect to investments 
the following table summarizes our significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations and other funding needs by payment date at september  the payment amounts represent those amounts due to the recipient and do not include any unamortized premiums or discounts or other similar carrying amount adjustments 
payments due by period contractual obligations less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years total in thousands federal home loan bank advances operating leases certificates of deposit private equity investments total commitments to extend credit includes accrued interest payable at september  includes the unused portion of home equity lines of credit of billion 
the company provides mortgage reinsurance on certain mortgage loans in its own portfolio  including home today loans  and loans in its servicing portfolio through contracts with two primary mortgage insurance companies 
under these contracts  the company absorbs mortgage insurance losses in excess of a specified percentage of the principal balance of a given pool of loans  subject to a contractual limit  in exchange for a portion of the pools mortgage insurance premiums 
as of september   approximately million of mortgage loans in our portfolios was covered by such mortgage reinsurance contracts 
at september   the maximum losses under the reinsurance contracts were limited to million 
the company has incurred million in losses under these reinsurance contracts and provided a liability for estimated losses totaling million as of september  management believes it has made adequate provision for estimated losses 
impact of inflation and changing prices our consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
gaap generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than the effects of inflation

the amendments are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  the company will adopt the amendments to topic on october  and does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
fasb accounting standards update asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment seeks to reduce the cost and complexity of performing the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test 
this amendment permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a more likely than not more than likelihood conclusion that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
the performance of the two step impairment test becomes unnecessary if after assessing the totality of events and circumstances  the entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
the amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
the company does not expect the adoption of these provisions to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
fasb asu  presentation of comprehensive income eliminates the option to present other comprehensive income oci in the statement of shareholders equity and provides an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of oci either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in both choices  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of oci along with a total for oci  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
regardless of whether an entity chooses to present comprehensive income in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements  the entity is required to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from oci to net income in the statement s 
the amendments in this update should be applied retrospectively and are effective for the company for the interim and annual periods beginning october   with early adoption permitted 
the only impact of these amendments on the company s consolidated financial statements will be a change in the presentation of oci 
fasb asu  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs eliminates unnecessary wording differences between us gaap and international financial reporting standards  clarifies the intent of existing fair value measurements  and expands disclosure requirements 
asu indicates that the highest and best use and valuation premise in a fair value measurement only apply to nonfinancial assets 
in addition  asu expands qualitative and quantitative fair value disclosures including those related to descriptions of valuation processes used  the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs and the interrelationships between those inputs  and quantitative disclosures about unobservable inputs and assumptions

adopted in fiscal year ended september  fasb asu  receivables topic a creditor s determination of whether a restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring provides additional guidance to creditors for evaluating whether a modification or restructuring of a receivable is a troubled debt restructuring tdr 
it requires creditors to evaluate modifications and restructurings of receivables using a more principles based approach 
financial reporting implications of being classified as a tdr are that the creditor is required to consider the receivable impaired when calculating the allowance for credit losses and provide additional disclosures about its troubled debt restructuring activities in accordance with the requirements of asu  disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses as described below 
asu clarifies the existing guidance on whether the creditor has granted a concession and whether the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties  which are the two criteria used to determine whether a modification or restructuring is a tdr

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
the majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
consequently  our most significant form of market risk has historically been interest rate risk 
in general  our assets  consisting primarily of mortgage loans  have longer maturities than our liabilities  consisting primarily of deposits 
as a result  a principal part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  our board of directors has established an asset liability management committee which is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities  for determining the level of risk that is appropriate  given our business strategy  operating environment  capital  liquidity and performance objectives  and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors 
we have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to control the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
as part of our ongoing asset liability management  we have historically used the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk i securitizing and selling long term  fixed rate residential real estate mortgage loans  ii marketing adjustable rate loan products  iii lengthening the weighted average remaining term of major funding sources  primarily by offering attractive interest rates on deposit products  particularly longer term certificates of deposit  iv investing in shorter to medium term investments and mortgage backed securities  and v maintaining high levels of capital 
during  and  million  billion and billion  respectively  of long term  fixed rate mortgage loans were securitized and sold 
these sales were undertaken to improve our interest rate risk position in the event that market interest rates increased 
effective july   fannie mae  historically the association s primary loan investor  implemented certain loan origination requirement changes affecting loan eligibility that we did not adopt 
accordingly  the association s ability to reduce interest rate risk via our traditional loan sales of newly originated longer term fixed rate residential loans is limited until either the association changes its loan origination processes or fannie mae  freddie mac or other market participants  revise their loan eligibility standards 
otherwise  future sales of fixed rate mortgage loans will predominantly be limited to those loans that have established payment histories  strong borrower credit profiles and are supported by adequate collateral values 
in response to this change  we are currently marketing an adjustable rate mortgage loan product that provides us with improved interest rate risk characteristics when compared to a long term  fixed rate mortgage 
shortening the average maturity of our interest earning assets by increasing our investments in shorter term loans and investments  as well as loans and investments with variable rates of interest  helps to better match the maturities and interest rates of our assets and liabilities  thereby reducing the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
by following these strategies  we believe that we are better positioned to react to increases in market interest rates 
net portfolio value 
as our primary regulator prior to its merger into the occ  the ots required the computation of amounts by which the net present value of an institution s cash flow from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items the institution s net portfolio value or npv would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
the ots provided all institutions that filed a consolidated maturity rate schedule as a part of their quarterly thrift financial report with an interest rate sensitivity report of npv 
the ots simulation model used a discounted cash flow analysis and an option based pricing approach in measuring the interest rate sensitivity of npv 
the ots model estimated the economic value of each type of asset  liability and off balance sheet contract under the assumption that instantaneous changes measured in basis points occur at all maturities along the united states treasury yield curve 
a basis point equals one hundredth of one percent  and basis points equals one percent 
an increase in interest rates from to would mean  for example  a basis point increase in the change in interest rates column below 
on a quarterly basis the ots provided us with the results of its interest rate sensitivity model  which was based on information we provided to the ots  to estimate the sensitivity of our npv 
in general  the assumptions used by the ots were  by necessity  more generic as their modeling framework had to fit and be adaptable to all institutions subject to its regulation 
the association has been advised that the results of the regulatory interest rate sensitivity model will not be prepared after december  the association also prepares interest rate sensitivity calculations 
our internal model is tailored specifically to our organization  which  we believe  improves the accuracy of our internally prepared npv estimates 
the following table presents our internal calculations of the estimated changes in the association s npv at september  that would result from the indicated instantaneous changes in the united states treasury yield curve 
computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposit decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
change in interest rates basis points estimated npv estimated increase decrease in npv npv as a percentage of present value of assets npv ratio increase decrease basis points amount percent dollars in thousands assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities 
npv is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest earning assets 
npv ratio represents npv divided by the present value of assets 
the table above indicates that at september   in the event of an increase of basis points in all interest rates  the association would experience a decrease in npv 
in the event of a basis point decrease in interest rates  the association would experience a increase in npv 
the following table is based on the calculations contained in the previous table  and sets forth the change in the npv at a basis point rate of shock at september   with comparative information as of september  by regulation the association must measure and manage its interest rate risk for an interest rate shock of basis points  whichever produces the largest decline in npv 
at september  risk measure bp rate shock pre shock npv ratio post shock npv ratio sesitivity measure in basis points the following table presents our internal calculations of the estimated changes in the association s npv at september  and that would result from the designated instantaneous changes in the united states treasury yield curve 
npv as a percentage of present value of assets change in interest rates basis points npv ratio at september  assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities 
present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest earning assets 
npv ratio represents npv divided by the present value of assets 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in determining interest rate risk through changes in npv 
modeling changes in npv require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the npv tables presented above assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assume that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv tables provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our npv and will differ from actual results 
we have previously reported that our former primary regulator  the ots  expressed concern with respect to several significant assumptions used in our current internal interest rate risk irr model  as well as the reliability of the resulting irr profiles generated by the model 
we believe that our internal irr model has enabled us to prudently and reasonably measure and manage irr  however  we are taking measures to replace our current modeling system with a system that offers enhanced functionality and capabilities 
installation and implementation of the new irr modeling software is currently underway  with completion expected by december  the new model possesses random patterning capabilities that our current model lacks and accommodates extensive regression analytics applicable to the prepayment and decay profiles of our borrower and depositor portfolios 
at the current time  we have not determined and validated how the initial estimates of the new model will compare with the estimates of our current model  however  we believe that the new model will expand our ability to run alternative modeling scenarios and will improve the timeliness of and our access to decision making data that will complement our irr management processes 
net interest income 
in addition to npv calculations  we analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through our internal net interest income model 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
in our model  we estimate what our net interest income would be for a twelve month period using ots pricing tables for assumptions such as loan prepayment rates and deposit decay rates  and the bloomberg forward yield curve for assumptions as to projected interest rates 
we then calculate what the net interest income would be for the same period in the event of an instantaneous basis point increase in market interest rates 
as of september   we estimated that our net interest income for the months ending september  would decrease by in the event of an instantaneous basis point increase in market interest rates 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in determining interest rate risk through changes in net interest income 
modeling changes in net interest income require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the interest rate risk information presented assumes that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains substantially constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although interest rate risk calculations provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results
