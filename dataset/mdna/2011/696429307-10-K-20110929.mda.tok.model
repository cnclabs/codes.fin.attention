b non cash working capital at july  has been impacted by the adoption of accounting guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb  regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
consistent with the provisions of this guidance  the company has reclassified certain tax related assets and liabilities from current to non current 
such reclassifications had the effect of increasing non cash working capital at july  by approximately c provision for income taxes in fiscal year includes a charge of for the net tax cost of the repatriation of approximately of foreign earnings and a change in estimate in fiscal year of certain income tax reserves 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
forward looking statements and risk factors the following discussion should be read together with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other financial information in this form k 
the discussion under the subheading review of operating segments below is in local currency ie  had exchange rates not changed year over year unless otherwise indicated 
company management considers local currency change to be an important measure because by excluding the impact of volatility of exchange rates  underlying volume change is clearer 
dollar amounts discussed below are in thousands  unless otherwise indicated  except per share dollar amounts 
in addition  per share dollar amounts are discussed on a diluted basis 
the company utilizes certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported financial information as well as to quantify the impact of various significant factors that contribute to the changes in the company s periodic results included in the discussion below 
the matters discussed in this annual report on form k contain forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements are those that address activities  events or developments that the company or management intends  expects  projects  believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future 
all statements regarding future performance  earnings projections  earnings guidance  management s expectations about its future cash needs and effective tax rate  and other future events or developments are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements contained in this and other written and oral reports are based on management s assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends  current conditions  expected future developments and other relevant factors 
they are subject to risks and uncertainties and are not guarantees of future performance  and actual results  developments and business decisions may differ materially from those envisaged by the company s forward looking statements 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  those discussed in part i item a 
risk factors in this form k 
the company makes these statements as of the date of this disclosure and undertakes no obligation to update them  whether as a result of new information  future developments or otherwise 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these accounting principles require the company to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the accompanying consolidated financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
although these estimates are based on company management s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future  actual results may differ from estimates 
the following discussion addresses the company s critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and that require judgment 
see also the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which contain additional information regarding the company s accounting policies 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax treatment and appropriate segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to avoid double taxation 
no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in the company s historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on the company s income tax provision and net earnings in the period in which a final determination is made 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount of the future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
while company management has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  there is no assurance that the valuation allowance would not need to be increased to cover additional deferred tax assets that may not be realizable 
any increase in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on the company s income tax provision and net earnings in the period in which such determination is made 
purchase accounting and goodwill determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
there are various methods used to estimate the value of tangible and intangible assets acquired  such as discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches 
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the two approaches include projected future cash flows including timing  discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in the future cash flows  perpetual growth rate  determination of appropriate market comparables  and the determination of whether a premium or a discount should be applied to comparables 
there are also judgments made to determine the expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the company performs impairment testing for goodwill at least annually during the company s fiscal third quarter  or more frequently if certain events or circumstances indicate impairment might have occurred 
the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a two step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level 
the company s two reportable operating segments  life sciences and industrial  are also deemed to be its reporting units for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment 
in the first step  the overall fair value for the reporting unit is compared to its book value including goodwill 
in the event that the overall fair value of the reporting unit was determined to be less than the book value  a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the book value of the goodwill 
the implied fair value for the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the overall fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of the net identifiable assets 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its book value  the difference is recognized as an impairment loss 
the company completed its annual goodwill impairment tests as of march  and march  the estimated fair values of both the life sciences and industrial reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying values of these reporting units  and as such  step two was not performed 
when testing for impairment  the company uses significant estimates and assumptions to estimate the fair values of its reporting units 
fair value of the company s reporting units is determined using market multiples derived from trailing twelve month revenue  earnings before interest and taxes ebit and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  of publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the company s reporting units 
these various market multiples are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested to determine a range of fair values for the reporting unit 
the fair value of the reporting units is then determined using the average of the fair values derived from the minimum and median market multiples 
the minimum and median market multiples used in the fiscal year impairment testing ranged from to times revenue  to times ebit and to times ebitda 
the minimum and median market multiples used in the fiscal year impairment testing ranged from to times revenue  to times ebit and to times ebitda 
to further substantiate the reasonableness of the fair value of its reporting units  the company compares enterprise value outstanding shares multiplied by the closing market price per share  plus debt  less cash and cash equivalents to the aggregate fair value of its reporting units 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer and when contractual terms have been fulfilled  except for certain long term contracts  whereby revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method see below 
transfer of title and risk of loss occurs when the product is delivered in accordance with the contractual shipping terms 
in instances where contractual terms include a provision for customer acceptance  revenue is recognized when either i the company has previously demonstrated that the product meets the specified criteria based on either seller or customer specified objective criteria or ii upon formal acceptance received from the customer where the product has not been previously demonstrated to meet customer specified objective criteria 
for contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method  revenue recognition is based upon the ratio of costs incurred to date compared with estimated total costs to complete 
the cumulative impact of revisions to total estimated costs is reflected in the period of the change  including anticipated losses 
allowance for doubtful accounts company management evaluates its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances when collection becomes doubtful 
in performing this evaluation  significant estimates are involved  including an analysis of specific risks on a customer by customer basis 
based upon this information  company management records in earnings an amount believed to be uncollectible 
if the factors used to estimate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts do not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost principally on the first in  first out method or market 
the company records adjustments to the carrying value of inventory based upon assumptions about historic usage  future demand and market conditions 
these adjustments are estimates which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from the company s expectations 
recoverability of available for sale investments other than temporary losses relating to available for sale investments are recognized in earnings when company management determines that the recoverability of the cost of the investment is unlikely 
such losses could result in a material adjustment in the period of the change 
company management considers numerous factors  on a case by case basis  in evaluating whether the decline in market value of an available for sale security below cost is other than temporary 
such factors include  but are not limited to  i the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and the near term prospects of the issuer of the investment  and iii whether company management intends to retain the investment for a period of time that is sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
defined benefit retirement plans the company sponsors defined benefit retirement plans in various forms covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liabilities related to those plans for which the benefit is actuarially determined 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company  within certain guidelines 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors  such as withdrawal and mortality rates  to calculate the liabilities and expense 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company are long term assumptions and may differ materially from actual experience in the short term due to changing market and economic conditions and changing participant demographics 
these differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense and pension assets liabilities recorded by the company 
pension expense associated with the company s defined benefit plans was  in fiscal year  which was based on a weighted average discount rate of calculated using the projected benefit obligation and a weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets of calculated using the fair value of plan assets 
the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the long term projected return of those assets 
if the expected long term rate of return on plan assets was reduced by basis points  pension expense in fiscal year would have increased approximately the objective of the discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled 
the company s methodology for selecting the discount rate for the us plans as of july  was to match the plan s cash flows to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zero coupon corporate bonds for each maturity 
this is under the premise that cash flows for benefits due in a particular year can be theoretically settled by investing them in the zero coupon bond that matures in the same year 
the discount rate is the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows 
the discount rate assumption for non us plans reflects the market rate for high quality  fixed income debt instruments 
both discount rate assumptions are based on the expected duration of benefit payments for each of the company s pension plans as of the annual measurement date and is subject to change each year 
if the weighted average discount rate was reduced by basis points  pension expense in fiscal year would have increased by approximately  accrued expenses and contingencies company management estimates certain material expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred 
when no estimate in a given range is deemed to be better than any other  the low end of the range is accrued 
differences between estimates and assumptions and actual results could result in an accrual requirement materially different from the calculated accrual 
environmental accruals are recorded based upon historical costs incurred and estimates for future costs of remediation and on going legal expenses which have a high degree of uncertainty 
self insured workers compensation insurance accruals are recorded based on insurance claims processed  including applied loss development factors as well as historical claims experience for claims incurred but not yet reported 
self insured employee medical insurance accruals are recorded based on medical claims processed as well as historical medical claims experience for claims incurred but not yet reported 
results of operations compared with review of consolidated results sales in fiscal year increased to billion from billion in fiscal year exchange rates used to translate foreign subsidiary results into us dollars increased reported sales by  primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar against various asian currencies the japanese yen jpy  australian dollar  chinese renminbi and singapore dollar and european currencies the swiss franc  euro and british pound

consumables sales increased  while systems sales grew 
the growth in the western hemisphere and europe was driven by robust activity in the oil and gas sector and continued recovery in the chemical sector 
europe also benefited from growth in emerging markets in the middle east 
the decline in asia primarily reflects a low level of investment activity in fiscal year that affected systems sales growth in the current year as well as weakness in the electronics grade chemical marketplace 
sales in the power generation submarket  which represented approximately of total industrial sales  increased 
the growth was driven by asia mainly china  reflecting strong demand in the wind turbine market and the western hemisphere  primarily driven by sales of water treatment and condensate systems to power stations in the us a decrease in sales in europe  related to overall weakness in the marketplace  particularly in the turbine oem and fossil sectors  partly offset the above 
municipal water submarket sales  which represented approximately of total industrial sales  increased 
by geography  sales in the western hemisphere the company s largest municipal water region grew  driven by municipalities in the us upgrading to membrane filtration to comply with environmental regulations

furthermore  the western hemisphere and europe benefited from an increase in sales to mobile oem customers construction and mining as they increased build rates to meet demand 
sales to the military aerospace submarket  which represented less than of total industrial sales  decreased primarily reflecting the impact of spending cutbacks by european governments 
this was partly offset by an increase in the western hemisphere reflecting increased shipments of spares to the us government 
sales to the commercial aerospace submarket  which represented less than of total industrial sales  increased  with all geographies contributing to the growth 
the growth in commercial aerospace sales was primarily driven by a modest increase in oem production rates  an increase in aftermarket sales related to an increase in air miles flown and modest improvement in the business jet market 
microelectronics sales  which represented about of total industrial sales  increased reflecting double digit growth in all geographies 
growth was particularly strong in the first half of fiscal year  with modest growth seen in the second half of the year 
overall  the sales growth reflects strength in the semiconductor marketplace 
oem activity was also strong globally  although some slowing was seen in the latter part of the year 
growth in the display marketplace in asia also positively impacted revenue growth year over year  particularly in the first half with slowing seen later in the year 
increased demand for consumer electronics  including tablets and smart phones  continue to positively impact sales growth in this market

adoption of new accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued updated guidance amending existing revenue recognition accounting pronouncements that address multiple element arrangements 
this guidance requires companies to allocate revenue in arrangements involving multiple deliverables based on the estimated selling price of each deliverable  even though such deliverables are not sold separately either by the company or other vendors 
this guidance eliminates the requirement that all undelivered elements must have objective and reliable evidence of fair value before a company can recognize the portion of the overall arrangement fee that is attributable to items that already have been delivered 
as a result  some companies may recognize revenue on transactions that involve multiple deliverables earlier than under previously existing authoritative guidance 
this new authoritative guidance was effective for the company beginning with its first quarter of fiscal year the adoption of this authoritative guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued new accounting guidance intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing 
entities will be allowed to perform a qualitative assessment on goodwill impairment to determine whether it is more likely than not defined as having a likelihood of more than percent that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
this guidance is effective for goodwill impairment tests performed in interim and annual periods for fiscal years beginning after december   which for the company is the first quarter of fiscal the company does not expect this guidance will have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position 
in june  the fasb issued new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
specifically  the new guidance allows an entity to present components of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement  referred to as the statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate  but consecutive statements 
the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
while the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income  there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance 
the adoption of this disclosure only guidance will not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial results and is effective for the company beginning with its third quarter of fiscal year in may  the fasb issued amendments to fair value measurement and disclosure requirements 
this guidance amends united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap to conform with measurement and disclosure requirements in international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the amendments change the wording used to describe the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
this includes clarification of the board s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements and those that change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
in addition  to improve consistency in application across jurisdictions  some changes in wording are necessary to ensure that us gaap and ifrs fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are described in the same way for example  using the word shall rather than should to describe the requirements in us gaap 
this amended guidance is to be applied prospectively and is effective for the company beginning with its third quarter of fiscal year the company is currently evaluating this guidance and has not yet determined the impact the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s primary market risks relate to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the sensitivity analyses presented below assume simultaneous shifts in each respective rate  and quantify the impact on the company s earnings and cash flows 
the changes used for these analyses reflect the company s view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
actual changes that differ from the changes used for these analyses could yield materially different results 
foreign currency the company s reporting currency is the us dollar 
because the company operates through subsidiaries or branches in over thirty countries around the world  its earnings are exposed to translation risk when the financial statements of the subsidiaries or branches  as stated in their functional currencies  are translated into the us dollar 
company management estimates that foreign exchange translation increased earnings per share by cents in fiscal year most of the company s products are manufactured in the us  puerto rico  germany and the united kingdom  and then sold into many countries 
the primary foreign currency exposures relate to adverse changes in the relationships of the us dollar to the euro  the japanese yen the yen  the british pound the pound  the australian dollar  the canadian dollar  swiss franc and the singapore dollar  as well as adverse changes in the relationship of the pound to the euro 
exposure exists when the functional currency of the buying subsidiaries weakens against the us dollar  the pound or the euro  thus causing an increase of the product cost to the buying subsidiary or a reduction in the sales price from the selling subsidiary  which adversely affects the company s consolidated gross margin and net earnings 
the effect of foreign exchange is partially mitigated because of the significant level of manufacturing done in europe 
in fiscal year  the euro  yen  pound australian dollar  canadian dollar  swiss franc and singapore dollar strengthened by approximately       and  respectively  against the us dollar compared with the average exchange rates in effect in fiscal year additionally  the euro weakened against the pound by approximately 
due to the difficulty in estimating the economic effect of foreign currency rates  particularly in periods of high volatility of such rates  company management does not provide such estimated effects and reports only the translation effect to earnings per share disclosed above 
the company is also exposed to transaction risk from adverse changes in exchange rates 
these short term transaction exposures are primarily yen  euro  pound and swiss franc denominated receivables and payables 
these short term exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates are managed by opening forward foreign exchange contracts forwards to offset the earnings and cash flow impact of non functional currency denominated receivables and payables as well as the expeditious payment of balances 
the company does not enter into forwards for trading purposes 
at july   these exposures amounted to approximately  and were offset by forwards with a notional principal amount of  if a hypothetical simultaneous adverse change had occurred in exchange rates as of july   net earnings would have decreased by approximately  or approximately cents per share 
interest rates the company is exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily due to its financing and cash management activities  which include long and short term debt as well as cash and certain short term  highly liquid investments considered to be cash equivalents 
the company s debt portfolio is comprised of both fixed and variable rate borrowings 
the company manages interest rate exposure by portfolio balancing including employing interest rate swaps 
the company s debt portfolio was approximately variable rate at july   compared to variable rate at july  for the year ended july   interest expense  net of interest income  was  a hypothetical shift in market interest rates for fiscal year eg  if an assumed market interest rate of increased to could have an adverse affect on interest expense  net of approximately
