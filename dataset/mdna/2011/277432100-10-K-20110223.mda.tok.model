management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap  the company management must make decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and assumptions on which to base estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets  environmental costs  us pension and other post employment benefits  litigation and contingent liabilities  and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience an d on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company management believes the critical accounting estimates described below are the most important to the fair presentation of the company financial condition and results 
these estimates require management most significant judgments in the preparation of the company consolidated financial statements 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company believes  based on historical results  the likelihood of actual write offs having a material impact on financial results is low 
however  if one of the company key customers was to file for bankruptcy  or otherwise be unwilling or unable to make its required payments  or there was a significant slow down in the economy  the company could increase its allowances 
this could result in a material charge to earnings 
the company allowances were million and million at december  and  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amount is not considered to be recoverable  an analysis of fair value is triggered 
an impairment is recorded for the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value 
the company conducts its annual testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in third quarter of each year  unless events warrant more frequent testing 
reporting units are identified for the purpose of assessing potential impairments of goodwill 
the carrying value of indefinite lived intangibles is considered impaired when their fair value  as established by appraisal or based on undiscounted future cash flows of certain related products  is less than their carrying value 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value of goodwill  additional steps  including an allocation of the estimated fair value to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  would be necessary to determine the amount  if any  of goodwill impairment 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles primarily consist of goodwill in the coatings  adhesives  specialty polymers and inks caspi and performance chemicals and intermediates pci segments 
the company also had recorded goodwill and other intangibles associated with the beaumont  texas industrial gasification project 
in fourth quarter  the company announced the discontinuance of the beaumont  texas industrial gasification project  which resulted in an impairment of the beaumont industrial gasification project goodwill and other intangible assets 
as the company assumptions related to long lived assets are subject to change  additional write downs may be required in the future 
if estimates of fair value less costs to sell are revised  the carrying amount of the related asset is adjusted  resulting in a charge to earnings 
the company recognized a definite lived intangible asset impairment charge of million resulting from an environmental regulatory change during fourth quarter impacting the fair value of air emission credits remaining from the previously discontinued beaumont  texas  gasification project 
the company recognized fixed tangible asset impairment charges of million and goodwill and definite lived intangible asset impairment charges of million in results from continuing operations during  related to the discontinuance of the beaumont  texas industrial gasification project 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental costs the company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
when a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range  the company accrues the minimum amount 
this undiscounted accrued amount reflects the company assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site  the nature of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based  unanticipated government enforcement action  or changes in health  safety  environmental  an d chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs 
estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs range from the minimum or best estimate of million to the maximum of million at december  in accordance with gaap  the company also establishes reserves for closure postclosure costs associated with the environmental and other assets it maintains 
environmental assets  as defined by gaap  include but are not limited to waste management units  such as landfills  water treatment facilities  and ash ponds 
when these types of assets are constructed or installed  a reserve is established for the future costs anticipated to be associated with the retirement or closure of the asset based on an expected life of the environmental assets and the applicable regulatory closure requirements 
these future expenses are charged against earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets 
currently  the company estimates the useful life of each individual asset is up to years 
if the company changes its estimate of the asset retirement obligation costs or its estimate of the useful lives of these assets  expenses to be charged against earnings could increase or decrease 
in accordance with gaap  the company also monitors conditional obligations and will record reserves associated with them when and to the extent that more detailed information becomes available concerning applicable retirement costs 
the company reserve  including the above remediation  was million at december  and million at december   representing the minimum or best estimate for remediation costs and the best estimate of the amount accrued to date over the regulated assets estimated useful lives for asset retirement obligation costs 
pension and other post employment benefits the company maintains defined benefit pension plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits 
additionally  eastman provides a subsidy toward life insurance  health care  and dental benefits for eligible retirees and a subsidy toward health care and dental benefits for retirees eligible survivors 
the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the company assumptions related to general economic conditions particularly interest rates and expected return on plan assets 
for the us plans  at december   the company assumed a discount rate of percent on its defined benefit pension plans  percent on its other post employment benefit plan and an expected return on assets of percent 
the cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographi c assumptions including retirements  mortality  turnover  and plan participation 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the december  projected benefit obligation and expense are affected by year end assumptions 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to changes in the company long term assumptions in the expected return on assets and assumed discount rate for the us pension plans and other postretirement welfare plans 
the sensitivities below are specific to the time periods noted 
they also may not be additive  so the impact of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities shown 
change in assumption impact on pre tax us benefits expense impact on december  projected benefit obligation for us pension plans impact on december  benefit obligation for other us postretirement plans basis point decrease in discount rate million million million basis point increase in discount rate million million million basis point decrease in expected return on assets million no impact n a basis point increase in expected return on assets million no impact n a the expected return on assets and assumed discount rate used to calculate the company pension and other post employment benefit obligations are established each december the expected return on assets is based upon the long term expected returns in the markets in which the pension trust invests its funds  primarily the domestic  international  and private equity markets 
historically  over a ten year period  excluding which is considered an anomaly due to the global recession  the company average achieved actual return has been equal to or greater than the expected return on assets 
the assumed discount rate is based upon a portfolio of high grade corporate bonds  which are used to develop a yield curve 
this yield curve is applied to the expected durations of the pension and post em ployment benefit obligations 
as future benefits under the us benefit plan have been fixed at a certain contribution amount  changes in the health care cost trend assumptions do not have a material impact on the results of operations 
the company uses the market related valuation method to determine the value of plan assets  which recognizes the change of the fair value of the plan assets over five years 
if actual experience differs from these long term assumptions  the difference is recorded as an unrecognized actuarial gain loss and then amortized into earnings over a period of time based on the average future service period  which may cause the expense related to providing these benefits to increase or decrease 
the charges applied to earnings in   and due to the amortization of these unrecognized actuarial losses  largely due to actual experience versus assumptions of discount rates  were million  million  and million  respectively 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company does not anticipate that a change in pension and other post employment obligations caused by a change in the assumed discount rate during will impact the cash contributions to be made to the pension plans during however  an after tax charge or credit will be recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity  as of december  for the impact on the pension projected benefit obligation of the change in interest rates  if any 
while the amount of the change in these obligations does not correspond directly to cash funding requirements  it is an indication of the amount the company will be required to contribute to the plans in future years 
the amount and timing of such cash contributions is dependent upon interest rates  actual returns on plan assets  retirement  attrition rates of employees  and other factors 
 for further information regarding pension and other post employment obligations  see 
note  retirement plans  to the company consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report 
litigation and contingent liabilities from time to time  the company and its operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits  claims  investigations and proceedings  including product liability  personal injury  asbestos  patent and intellectual property  commercial  contract  environmental  antitrust  health and safety  and employment matters  which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business 
the company accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
when a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range  the company accrues the minimum amount 
the company expenses legal costs  including those expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency  as incurred 
based upon facts and information currently available  the company believes the amounts reserved are adequate for such pending matters  however  results of operations could be affected by monetary damages  costs or expenses  and charges against earnings in particular periods 
income taxes the company records deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the ability to realize the deferred tax assets is evaluated through the forecasting of taxable income using historical and projected future operating results  the reversal of existing temporary differences  and the availability of tax planning strategies 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
in the event that the actual outcome from future tax consequences differs from our estimates and assumptions  the resulting change to the provision f or income taxes could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated results of operations and statement of financial position 
as of december   a valuation allowance of million has been provided against the deferred tax assets 
the company recognizes income tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold and accrues interest related to unrecognized income tax positions  which is recorded as a component of the income tax provision

the company decision to discontinue the industrial gasification project was due to a number of factors  including high capital costs  the current and projected reduced spread between natural gas and oil and petroleum coke prices  and continued uncertainty regarding us energy and environmental public policy 
in  the company sold certain mineral rights at an operating manufacturing site  recognizing million of other operating income 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in fourth quarter  the company completed the sale of its mexico and argentina manufacturing facilities in its performance polymer segment 
as part of this divestiture  the company entered into transition supply agreements for polymer intermediates from which sales revenue and operating results are included in the pci segment results in in fourth quarter  the company sold its pe and epolenetm polymer businesses and related assets of the performance polymers and caspi segments 
as part of the pe divestiture  the company entered into a transition supply agreement for contract ethylene sales  from which sales revenue and operating earnings are included in the pci segment results in and also in fourth quarter  the company made strategic decisions relating to the scheduled shutdown of cracking units in longview  texas 
accelerated depreciation costs resulting from these decisions was million in for more information on accelerated depreciation costs  see gross profit in the 
summary of consolidated results compared with results of operations section of this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
eastman management believes that contract ethylene sales under the transition agreement related to the divestiture of the pe product lines  contract polymer intermediates sales under a transition supply agreement related to the divestiture of the pet assets and businesses in mexico and argentina  and the other operating income from the sale of mineral rights do not reflect the continuing and expected future business of the pci segment or of the company 
in addition  for evaluation and analysis of ongoing business results and the impact on the company and segments of strategic decisions and actions to reduce costs  to improve the profitability of the company  and favorably adjust its debt maturities and cost  management believes that company and segment earnings from continuing operations should be considered both with an d without accelerated depreciation costs  asset impairments and restructuring charges  deferred tax benefits related to the previous divestiture of businesses  and early debt extinguishment costs 
management believes that investors can better evaluate and analyze historical and future business trends if they also consider the reported company and segment results  respectively  without the identified items 
management utilizes company and segment results including and excluding the identified items in the measures it uses to evaluate business performance and in determining certain performance based compensation 
these measures  excluding the identified items  are not recognized in accordance with gaap and should not be viewed as alternatives to the gaap measures of performance

cash flows from operations and the other sources of liquidity described above are expected to be available and sufficient to meet foreseeable cash flow requirements 
however  the company cash flows from operations can be affected by numerous factors including risks associated with global operations  raw material availability and cost  demand for and pricing of eastman products  capacity utilization  and other factors described under

note  equity investments  to the company consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report  eastman has a percent interest in and serves as the operating partner in primester  a joint venture which manufactures cellulose acetate at eastman kingsport  tennessee plant 
this investment is accounted for under the equity method 
eastman net investment in the joint venture at december  and was approximately million and million  respectively  which was comprised of the recognized portion of the venture accumulated deficits  long term amounts owed to primester  and a line of credit from eastman to primester 
the company did not have any other material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  including special purpose entities  for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements with contractually narrow or limited purposes 
thus  eastman is not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market  or credit risk related to the above or any other such relationships 
the accounting guidance on consolidation of variable interest entities vies is effective for all vies or potential vies the company is involved with on or after january  this guidance amends the evaluation criteria to identify which entity has a controlling financial interest of a variable interest entity and requires ongoing reassessments 
the company has evaluated its material contractual relationships under this new guidance and has concluded that the entities involved in these relationships are not vies or  in the case of primester  a joint venture that manufactures cellulose acetate at the company kingsport  tennessee plant  the company has shared control of the vie 
as such  the company is not required to consolidate these entities 
guarantees and claims also arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with suppliers  customers  and other parties when the company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others  if specified triggering events occur 
non performance under a contract could trigger an obligation of the company 
these potential claims include actions based upon alleged exposures to products  intellectual property and environmental matters  and other indemnifications 
the ultimate effect on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists as to the final outcome of these claims 
however  while the ultimate liabilities resulting from such claims may be significant to results of operations in the period recognized  managemen t does not anticipate they will have a material adverse effect on the company consolidated financial position or liquidity

in connection with the cleanup of various hazardous waste sites  the company  along with many other entities  has been designated a potentially responsible party prp by the us environmental protection agency under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  which potentially subjects prps to joint and several liability for such cleanup costs 
in addition  the company will be required to incur costs for environmental remediation and closure and postclosure under the federal resource conservation and recovery act 
reserves for environmental contingencies have been established in accordan ce with eastman policies as described in 
note  significant accounting policies  to the company consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report 
because of expected sharing of costs  the availability of legal defenses  and the company preliminary assessment of actions that may be required  it does not believe its liability for these environmental matters  individually or in the aggregate  will be material to the company consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
when a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range  the company accrues the minimum amount 
this undiscounted accrued amount reflects the company assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site  the nature of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based  unanticipated government enforcement action  or changes in health  safety  environmental  and chem ical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs 
estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs range from the minimum or best estimate of million to the maximum of million at december  in addition to remediation activities  the company establishes reserves for closure and postclosure costs associated with the environmental assets it maintains 
environmental assets include but are not limited to waste management units  such as landfills  water treatment facilities  and ash ponds 
when these types of assets are constructed or installed  a reserve is established for the anticipated future costs associated with the closure of the asset based on its expected life and the applicable regulatory closure requirements 
these future expenses are charged into earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets 
the best estimate accrued to date over the facilities estimated useful lives for asset retirement obligation costs is million at december  gaap requires an entity to recognize a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation caro when incurred if the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the company has performed an examination of various asset categories as of december  although it may have caros at certain of its facilities  including  but not limited to  the potential for asbestos abatement activities  the company is unable to determine potential settlement dates to be used in fair value calculations for estimating these obligations as a result of an absence of plans or expectations to undertake a major renovation or demolition project that would require the removal of asbestos 
the company continues to monitor these conditional obligations  as w ell as any new ones that may develop  and will record reserves associated with them when and to the extent that more detailed information becomes available concerning applicable retirement costs 
the recorded obligations did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reserves related to environmental assets accounted for approximately percent of the total environmental reserve at december  currently  the company environmental assets are expected to reach the end of their useful lives at different times over the next years 
if the company was to invest in numerous new environmental assets  or  these assets were to require closure a significant number of years before the company anticipated they would  the amortization on them would increase  and could have a material negative impact on the company financial condition and results of operations 
the company views the likelihood of this occurrence to be remote  and does not anticipate  based on its past experience with this type of planned remediation  that an additional accrual related to environmental assets will be necessary 
the company cash expenditures related to environmental protection and improvement were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
these amounts were primarily for operating costs associated with environmental protection equipment and facilities  but also included expenditures for construction and development 
other than potential capital expenditures at the company s kingsport  tennessee facility related to regulations associated with controlling air emissions from boilers  the company does not expect future environmental capital expenditures arising from requirements of recently promulgated environmental laws and regulations to materially increase the company planned level of annual capital expenditures for environmental control facilities 
potential capi tal expenditures associated with boiler air emissions remain uncertain pending adoption of final regulations  but could increase average annual capital expenditures significantly over the next five years compared to recent historical levels depending on financial regulation requirements and the company method of addressing those requirements 
inflation in recent years  general economic inflation has not had a material adverse impact on eastman costs 
the cost of raw materials is generally based on market price  although derivative financial instruments were utilized  as appropriate  to mitigate short term market price fluctuations 
the volatility of raw material and energy costs will continue and the company will continue to pursue pricing and hedging strategies and ongoing cost control initiatives to offset the effects on gross profit

these plans and expectations are based upon certain underlying assumptions  including those mentioned with the specific statements 
such assumptions are based upon internal estimates and analyses of current market conditions and trends  management plans and strategies  economic conditions and other factors 
these plans and expectations and the underlying assumptions are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in projecting future conditions and results 
actual results could differ materially from expectations expressed in any forward looking statement if one or more of the underlying assumptions or expectations proves to be inaccurate or is unrealized 
in addition to the factors described elsewhere in this annual report  the following are the most significant known factors that c ould cause the company actual results to differ materially from those in any such forward looking statement 
additional factors not presently known to the company  or that the company does not currently believe to be material  may also cause actual results to differ materially from expectations 
adverse and uncertain conditions in the global economy and the financial markets could negatively impact the company 
while economic and financial market conditions improved in  continued uncertain conditions in the global economy and global capital markets may adversely affect the company results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
the company business and operating results were affected by the impact of the recent global recession  including the credit market crisis  declining consumer and business confidence  fluctuating commodity prices  volatile exchange rates  and other challenges that affected the global economy 
if the global economy again deteriorates  the company results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
if the global economy weakens  or if the global economy or financial markets experience significant new disruptions or deterioration  the company ability to access the credit and capital markets under attractive rates and terms could be constrained  which may negatively impact the company liquidity or ability to pursue certain growth initiatives 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations volatility in costs for strategic raw material and energy commodities or disruption in the supply of these commodities could adversely affect our financial results 
the company is reliant on certain strategic raw material and energy commodities for its operations and utilizes risk management tools  including hedging  as appropriate  to mitigate short term market fluctuations in raw material and energy costs 
these risk mitigation measures cannot eliminate all exposure to market fluctuations 
in addition  natural disasters  plant interruptions  changes in laws or regulations  war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism  and breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of strategic raw material and energy commodities  could adversely impact both the cost and availability of these commodities 
the company could be materially adversely affected by disruptions to manufacturing operations or related infrastructure 
significant limitation of the company ability to manufacture products due to disruption of manufacturing operations or related infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on the company s sales revenue  costs  results of operations  and financial condition 
disruptions could occur due to internal factors such as computer or equipment malfunction  operator error  or process failures  or external factors such as natural disasters  pandemic illness  changes in laws or regulations  war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism  or breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of supplies to the company or for delivery of products to customers 
loss or financial weakness of any of the company largest customers could adversely affect our financial results 
the company has an extensive customer base  however  loss of  or material financial weakness of  certain of our largest customers could adversely affect the company financial condition and results of operations until such business is replaced and no assurances can be made that the company would be able to regain or replace any lost customers 
growth initiatives may not achieve desired business or financial objectives and may require a significant use of resources in excess of those estimated or budgeted for such initiatives 
the company continues to identify and pursue growth opportunities through both internal or organic development and acquisitions and joint ventures to diversify and extend the portfolio of our businesses 
these growth opportunities include development and commercialization of new products and technologies  expansion into new markets and geographic regions  and alliances  ventures  and acquisitions that complement and extend the company portfolio of businesses and capabilities 
there can be no assurance that such efforts  investments  or acquisitions and alliances will result in financially successful commercialization of products or acceptance by existing or new customers or new markets or achieve their underlying strategic business objectives or that they will be beneficial to the company results of oper ations 
there also can be no assurance that capital projects for such growth efforts can be completed within the time or at the costs projected due  among other things  to demand for and availability of construction materials and labor and obtaining regulatory approvals and operating permits and reaching agreement on terms of key agreements and arrangements with potential suppliers and customers 
any such delays or cost overruns or the inability to obtain such approvals or to reach such agreements on acceptable terms could negatively affect the returns from any proposed investments and projects 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations legislative or regulatory actions could increase the company future compliance costs 
the company facilities and businesses are subject to complex health  safety and environmental laws and regulations  which require and will continue to require significant expenditures to remain in compliance with such laws and regulations 
the company accruals for such costs and associated liabilities are subject to changes in estimates on which the accruals are based 
the amount accrued reflects the company assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site  the nature of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based  unanticipated government enforcement action  or c hanges in health  safety  environmental  chemical control regulations  and testing requirements could result in higher costs 
pending and proposed us federal legislation and regulation increase the likelihood that the company manufacturing sites will in the future be impacted by regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and energy policy  which legislation and regulation  if enacted  may result in capital expenditures  increases in costs for raw materials and energy  limitations on raw material and energy source and supply choices  and other direct compliance costs 
in addition to the foregoing most significant known risk factors to the company  there may be other factors  not currently known to the company  which could  in the future  materially adversely affect the company  its business  financial condition  or results of operations 
the foregoing discussion of the most significant risk factors to the company does not necessarily present them in order of importance

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk eastman chemical company and subsidiaries eastman or the company are exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of its business due to its use of certain financial instruments as well as transacting in various foreign currencies and funding foreign operations 
to mitigate the company exposure to these market risks  eastman has established policies  procedures  and internal processes governing its management of financial market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage its exposure to such risks 
the company determines its market risk utilizing sensitivity analyses  which measure the potential losses in fair value resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and or commodity prices 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing and investing activities  which include long term borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund its business operations and capital requirements 
from time to time  to manage the mix of fixed and variable rate debt effectively  the company enters into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount 
currently  these borrowings  investments  and swaps are predominately us dollar denominated 
the nature and amount of the company long term and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions  and other factors 
for purposes of calculating the market risks associated with the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments  the company uses a one percent or less absolute shift in interest rates 
for and  the market risks associated with the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments  assuming an instantaneous absolute shift in interest rates of one percent or less were approximately million and million  respectively 
this exposure is primarily related to long term debt with fixed interest rates 
the company operating cash flows and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company continually evaluates its foreign currency exposure based on current market conditions and the locations in which the company conducts business 
in order to mitigate the effect of foreign currency risk  the company enters into currency options to hedge probable anticipated  but not yet committed  export sales and purchase transactions expected within no more than five years and denominated in foreign currencies  and forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of related exposures 
it is the company policy to enter into fore ign currency derivative financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above 
the company does not enter into foreign currency derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
for  the market risks associated with borrowings denominated in foreign currencies assuming a percent adverse move in the us dollar relative to each foreign currency was approximately million and an additional million for each additional one percentage point adverse change in foreign currency rates 
for  the market risks associated with borrowings denominated in foreign currencies assuming a percent adverse move in the us dollar relative to each foreign currency was approximately million and an additional million for each additional one percentage point adverse change in foreign currency rates 
furthermore  since the company utilizes currency sensitive derivative instruments for hedging anticipated for eign currency transactions  a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying anticipated transactions 
the company is exposed to fluctuations in market prices for certain of its major raw materials and energy 
to mitigate short term fluctuations in market prices for certain commodities  principally propane  natural gas  and ethane  the company enters into option and forward contracts 
for  the market risk associated with forwards and options for feedstock and natural gas  assuming an instantaneous parallel shift in the underlying commodity price of percent  was million and less than an additional million for each one percentage point move in closing price thereafter 
for  the market risk associated with forwards and options for feedstock and natural gas  assuming an instantaneous parallel shift in the underlying commodity price of percent  was million and less than an additional million for each one percentage point move in closing price thereafter
