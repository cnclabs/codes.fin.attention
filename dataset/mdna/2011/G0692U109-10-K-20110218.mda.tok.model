subsidiary 
media pro was a full service managing general underwriter with operations in the us  canada and the us we were the exclusive carrier for several of media pro s programs for the preceding two years and this purchase gave us the renewal rights to their broader professional lines portfolio 
during  as part of our long term strategy of global expansion  we established new underwriting branches in singapore  australia and canada 
during  we purchased dexta  an underwriting agency with a distribution network in australia 
we had been providing professional indemnity  directors and officers liability and information technology liability insurance coverages as a direct offshore foreign insurer in australia through dexta since effective january   the insurance coverages previously underwritten through dexta were underwritten directly by axis specialty australia 
during  we established a new axis global accident health line of business within our insurance segment 
we offer a range of insurance products in the us  us and european markets  including business travel accident  corporate personal accident  accident and sickness and other specialty health coverages for employer groups  affinity groups and the customers of financial institutions 
we also offer accident and specialty health reinsurance coverage on a global basis from our dublin  london and princeton  new jersey offices 
reinsurance is available on a quota share  excess of loss and aggregate excess of loss basis 

table of contents our business strategy our long term business strategy focuses on utilizing our management s extensive expertise  experience and long standing market relationships to identify and underwrite attractively priced risks while delivering insurance and reinsurance solutions to our customers 
our underwriters worldwide are focused on constructing a portfolio of risks that effectively utilizes our capital while optimizing the risk reward characteristics of the portfolio 
we exercise disciplined underwriting practices and manage a diverse book of business while seeking to maximize our profitability and generate superior returns on equity 
to afford ourselves ample opportunity to construct a portfolio diversified by product and geography that meets our profitability and return objectives  we have implemented organic growth strategies in key markets worldwide 
risk management is a strategic priority embedded in our culture and our risk management department continues to monitor  review and refine our enterprise risk management framework 
the markets in which we operate have historically been cyclical 
during periods of excess underwriting capacity  as defined by availability of capital  competition can result in lower pricing and less favorable policy terms and conditions for insurers and reinsurers 
during periods of reduced underwriting capacity  pricing and policy terms and conditions are generally more favorable for insurers and reinsurers 
historically  underwriting capacity has been impacted by several factors  including industry losses  catastrophes  changes in legal and regulatory guidelines  investment results and the ratings and financial strength of competitors 
an overview of the insurance and reinsurance market over the past five years is presented below  together with a discussion as to how we have evolved during this period 
gross premiums written in each of our segments over the last five years is presented in the following table year ended december  insurance reinsurance total in our insurance segment  market conditions have been increasingly competitive for several years  with surplus capacity and rate deterioration prevalent across most of our portfolio 
as a result  we have reduced our participation in certain business in recent years 
these trends explain the decline in gross premiums written for the segment following their and highs 
however  the impact of these trends has been partially offset by specific  targeted growth opportunities  including our expansion into the canadian and australian markets 
the expansion of our professional lines business  both through the purchase of the media pro business in as well as new business opportunities arising during and in the aftermath of the financial market crisis  is an example of another targeted growth opportunity 
in addition  we saw certain opportunities to write new business in the us property market during we have also added underwriting expertise to our credit and political risk team in recent years and established a branch in singapore  which has provided us with access to a broader range of distribution channels 
this has allowed us to provide more products which are not as closely correlated to the property and liability cycle  in particular  emerging market sovereign and corporate credit 
our ability and appetite to write this business  however  has been reduced since the latter part of due to the impact of the global financial crisis 
during  we continued to invest in the development of our new global accident health business 

table of contents in our reinsurance segment  market conditions have not been conducive to premium growth in recent years amidst a trend of greater risk and retention appetite in the industry 
however  conditions have generally been better than the primary market and this provided us with an opportunity to achieve greater market penetration in the us and european reinsurance markets over this period 
specific market opportunities  including dislocation in the european trade credit and bond reinsurance market and our entry into the latin american surety business allowed us to increase our premium base during growth in our latin american business continued during and we increased our participation in select european motor reinsurance markets 
we established a ceded reinsurance unit during  which coordinates our reinsurance purchasing activities and has allowed us to improve efficiency and consistency and to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace 
we made certain changes to optimize our ceded reinsurance programs on renewal during  including an increase in our attachment points on our property excess of loss program and a reduction in cession rates on our professional lines quota share program 
we believe these adjustments provide for an improved balance between risk and reward and take into consideration improvements in our overall capital position 
segment information our underwriting operations are organized around two global underwriting platforms  axis insurance and axis re 
therefore we have determined that we had two reportable segments  insurance and reinsurance 
except for goodwill and intangible assets  we do not allocate our assets by segment as we evaluate the underwriting results of each segment separately from the results of our investment portfolio 
financial data relating to our segments is included in note to our consolidated financial statements presented under item and in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  under item insurance segment lines of business and distribution our insurance segment operates through offices in bermuda  the united states  canada  europe  australia and singapore and offers specialty insurance products to a variety of niche markets on a worldwide basis

table of contents competitive environment we operate in highly competitive markets 
in our insurance segment  where competition is focused on price as well as availability  service and other considerations  we compete with us based companies with global insurance operations  as well as non us global carriers and indigenous companies in regional and local markets 
we believe we achieve a competitive advantage through a strong capital position and the strategic and operational linking of our practices  which allows us to design insurance programs on a global basis in alignment with the global needs of many of our clients 
reinsurance segment lines of business and distribution our reinsurance segment operates through offices in bermuda  new york  zurich and singapore 
we focus on writing business on an excess of loss basis  where possible  whereby we typically provide an indemnification to the reinsured entity for a portion of losses both individually and in the aggregate  on policies in excess of a specified individual or aggregate loss deductible 
we also write business on a proportional basis  receiving an agreed percentage of the premium and accepting liability for the same percentage of incurred losses 
reinsurance may be written on a portfolio ie treaty basis or on an individual risk ie facultative basis 
the majority of our business is written on a treaty basis and primarily produced through reinsurance brokers worldwide 
our reinsurance segment provides non life reinsurance to insurance companies on a worldwide basis 
the following are the lines of business in our reinsurance segment catastrophe provides protection for most catastrophic losses that are covered in the underlying insurance policies written by our cedants 
the exposure in the underlying policies is principally property exposure but also covers other exposures including workers compensation  personal accident and life 
the principal perils in this portfolio are hurricane and windstorm  earthquake  flood  tornado  hail and fire 
in some instances  terrorism may be a covered peril or the only peril 
we underwrite catastrophe reinsurance principally on an excess of loss basis 
property includes reinsurance written on both a proportional and a per risk excess of loss basis and covers underlying personal lines and commercial property exposures 
here the primary reason for the product is not simply to protect against catastrophic perils  however they are normally included with limitations

gross premiums written by broker  shown individually where premiums were or more of the total in any of the last three years  were as follows year ended december  aon marsh willis other brokers direct total no customer accounted for more than of the gross premiums written in the reinsurance segment 
competitive environment in our reinsurance segment where competition tends to be focused on availability  service  financial strength and increasingly price  we compete with major us and us reinsurers as well as reinsurance departments of numerous multi line insurance organizations 
we believe that we achieve a competitive advantage through our strong capital position  as well as our technical expertise that allows us to respond quickly to customer needs and provide quality and innovative underwriting solutions 
in addition  our customers highly value our exemplary service and financial strength ratings 
reinsurance protection our ceded reinsurance unit coordinates the purchase of treaty and facultative reinsurance to reduce our exposure to significant losses 
substantially all of our ceded reinsurance is purchased to cover business written in our insurance segment 
our reinsurance purchasing group  comprising senior management  pre approves all treaty reinsurance purchases and establishes facultative reinsurance strategies 
facultative reinsurance provides coverage for all or a portion of the losses incurred for a single policy and we separately negotiate each facultative contract 
treaty reinsurance provides coverage for a specified type or category of risks 
our treaty reinsurance agreements may be on an excess of loss or proportional basis 
excess of loss covers provide a contractually set amount of coverage after a specified loss amount has been reached 
this specified loss amount can be based on the size of an 
table of contents industry loss or on a company specific incurred loss amount 
these covers can be purchased on a package policy basis  which provide us with cover for a number of lines of business within one contract 
in contrast  proportional covers provide us with a specified percentage of coverage from the first dollar of loss 
all of these reinsurance covers provide us the right to recover a portion of our losses and loss expenses from reinsurers 
however  to the extent that our reinsurers do not meet their obligations under these agreements due to solvency issues  contractual disputes or other reason  we remain liable 
reserve for unpaid losses and loss expenses we establish reserves for losses and loss expenses that arise from our insurance and reinsurance products 
these reserves are balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of future amounts required to pay losses and loss expenses for insured or reinsured claims that have occurred at or before the balance sheet date  whether already known or not yet reported 
our loss reserves are established based upon our estimate of the total cost of claims that were reported to us but not yet paid case reserves  and the anticipated cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to us ibnr 
the table below shows the development of our loss reserves since inception 
to illustrate an understanding of the information in this table  following is an example using reserves established at december  the top lines of the table show for successive balance sheet dates the gross and net unpaid losses and loss expenses recorded at or prior to each balance sheet date 
it can be seen that at december   a reserve of  million  net of reinsurance was established 
the lower part of the table presents the net amounts paid as of periods subsequent to the balance sheet date 
hence in the year ended december   net payments of million were made from the december  reserve balance 
by the end of  cumulative net payments against the december  net reserves were  million 
the upper part of the table shows the revised estimate of the net liabilities originally recorded as of the end of subsequent years 
with the benefit of actual loss emergence over the intervening period  the net liabilities incurred as of december   are now estimated to be  million  rather than the original estimate of  million 
of the cumulative redundancy of million recognized in the five years since december   million was identified and recorded in  million in  million in  million in and the remaining million in importantly  the cumulative deficiency or redundancy for different balance sheet dates is not independent and therefore  should not be added together 
in  we have revised our estimate of the december   liabilities from  million to  million 
this favorable development of million will also be included in each column to the right of december   to recognize that there was also reserve redundancy in the reserves established at december    and 
table of contents year ended december  gross reserves for losses and loss expenses reinsurance recoverable net losses and loss expenses reserve net reserves reestimated as of year later years later years later years later years later years later years later years later years later cumulative redundancy cumulative net paid losses as of year later years later years later years later years later years later years later years later years later impact of unrealized foreign exchange movements gross reserve for losses and loss expenses reestimated reinsurance recoverable net losses and loss expenses reserve reestimated cumulative redundancy on gross reserve the table above also shows the impact of foreign exchange rate movements 
movements in foreign exchange rates between periods result in variations in our net loss reserves  as the us dollar  our reporting currency  strengthens or weakens against underlying currencies 
for example  during the year ended december  the strengthening of the us dollar  primarily against the euro and sterling  largely resulted in a million decrease in our net loss reserves established prior to or during we generally hold investments in the same currency as our net reserves  with the intent of matching the impact of foreign exchange movements on our assets and liabilities 
conditions and trends that affected the development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
accordingly  it may be inappropriate to anticipate future redundancies or deficiencies based on historical experience 
the key issues and considerations involved in establishing our estimate of our loss reserves is discussed in more detail within the critical accounting estimates reserve for losses and loss expenses section of item for additional information regarding the key underlying movements in our loss reserves in the last three years  refer to the underwriting results group underwriting expenses section of item 
table of contents cash and investments we seek to balance the investment portfolios objectives of increasing book value with the generation of relatively stable investment income  while providing sufficient liquidity to meet our claims and other obligations 
liquidity needs arising from potential claims are of primary importance and are considered in asset class participation and the asset allocation process 
intermediate maturity investment grade fixed income securities have duration characteristics similar to our expected claim payouts and are therefore central to our investment portfolio s asset allocation 
at december   the duration of our fixed maturities portfolio was approximately years  which approximates the estimated duration of our net insurance liabilities 
to diversify risk and optimize the growth in our book value  we may invest in other asset classes such as equity securities  high yield securities and alternative investments eg hedge funds which provide higher potential total rates of return 
such individual investment classes involve varying degrees of risk  including the potential for more volatile returns and reduced liquidity 
however  as part of a balanced portfolio  they also provide diversification from interest rate and credit risk 
with regard to our investment portfolio  we utilize third party investment managers for security selection and trade execution functions  subject to our guidelines and objectives for each asset class 
this enables us to actively manage our investment portfolio with access to top talents specializing in various products and markets 
we select the managers based on various criteria including investment style  track record  performance and corporate governance 
additionally  we monitor approved investment asset classes for each subsidiary through analysis of our operating environment  including expected volatility of cash flows  overall capital position  regulatory and rating agency considerations 
the finance committee of our board of directors approves our overall group asset allocation targets and investment policy and guidelines to ensure that they are consistent with our overall goals  strategies and objectives 
we also have an investment committee  comprising senior management  which oversees the implementation of our investment strategy 
for additional information regarding the investment portfolio refer to the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cash and investments section under item and note investments to our consolidated financial statements presented under item refer to risk and capital management for details relating to the management of our investment risk 
risk and capital management mission and objectives of risk management the mission of enterprise risk management erm at axis is to promptly identify  measure  report and monitor risks that affect the achievement of our strategic  operational and financial objectives 
this includes adjusting the risk profile in line with the group s stated risk tolerance to respond to new threats and opportunities in order to optimize returns 
our major erm objectives are to protect our capital base and earnings by monitoring that risks are not taken beyond the group s risk tolerance  
table of contents promote a sound culture of risk awareness and disciplined and informed risk taking  enhance value creation and contribute to an optimal risk return profile by providing the basis for efficient capital deployment  and support our group wide decision making process by providing reliable and timely risk information 
risk management framework in order to achieve our mission and objectives  the group relies on its risk management framework 
at the heart of the risk management framework is a robust governance process with clear responsibilities for taking  managing  monitoring and reporting risks 
we articulate the roles and responsibilities for risk management throughout the organization  from the board of directors and the chief executive officer to our businesses and functional areas  thus embedding risk management in the business 
to support the governance process  the group relies on documented policies and guidelines 
our risk standards specify our principles  risk appetite and tolerances for managing individual and aggregate risks 
we also have procedures to approve exceptions to risk limits and procedures for the timely referral of risk issues to senior management and the board of directors 
our comprehensive qualitative and quantitative risk reporting framework provides transparency and early warning indicators to senior management with regard to our overall risk profile as well as to whether our profile is within our established risk tolerances 
for example  risk dashboards and limit consumption reports are regularly prepared  communicated and monitored 
various governance and control functions coordinate to help ensure that objectives are being achieved  risks are identified and appropriately managed and internal controls are in place and operating effectively 
also paramount to our risk management framework is our economic capital model 
utilizing this modeling framework provides us with a holistic view of the capital we put at risk in any year by allowing us to understand the relative interaction between all of the risks impacting us 
this integrated approach recognizes that a single risk factor can affect different sub portfolios and that different risk factors can have different mutual dependencies 
the economic capital model is used to support  inform and improve decision making across the group 
we are constantly reviewing and improving our economic capital model as our business  risk landscape and external environment continue to evolve 
our basis for accepting risk is determined by our risk appetite  as approved by our board 
our risk appetite is a function of our capital  profitability and stakeholder expectations of the types of risk we hold within our business 
external perspectives various external stakeholders  among them regulators  rating agencies  investors and accounting bodies  are placing increasing emphasis on the importance of sound risk management in our industry 
new and emerging regulatory regimes  such as solvency ii in the european union  emphasize a risk based and economic approach  based on comprehensive quantitative and qualitative assessments and reports 
rating agencies are increasingly interested in risk management as a factor in evaluating companies 
standard poor s  a rating agency with a separate rating for erm  confirmed our group s erm rating as strong in 
table of contents investment risk  operational risk and emerging risk were upgraded from adequate to strong 
after this latest review  axis capital is now rated either strong or excellent in all of standard poor s dimensions for erm 
we are involved in a number of international industry organizations engaged in advancing the regulatory dialogue pertaining to insurance and financial services 
collaboration with external partners also complements our internal management of emerging risks 
an example of this collaboration is our participation on the climate change working group of the geneva association 
the objectives of the group is to identify and analyze issues that are of specific relevance to the insurance industry  such as the likely range of future claims costs  new business opportunities and scenario testing 
risk governance the key elements of our governance framework  as it relates specifically to risk management  are described below 
board of directors level the board of directors is ultimately responsible for the group s risk management framework 
the risk committee of the board serves as a focal point for this oversight 
the risk committee assesses whether significant risk issues are being appropriately addressed by management in a timely manner 
the risk committee of the board annually reviews and approves our risk standards 
additionally  it reviews the group s key risk exposures across major risk categories as well as risk and capacity limits and their usage on a quarterly basis 
in terms of risk measurement  the risk committee reviews the critical principles and assumptions used in our economic capital model 
the finance committee of the board makes decisions about investments and market risk  while complying with the group s risk framework 
group executive level the executive committee oversees the group s performance with regard to risk management as well as control  strategic  financial and business policy issues of group wide relevance 
this includes monitoring adherence to and further development of our risk management policies and procedures 
the executive committee receives regular briefings and recommendations from the risk management committee rmc on the group s risk profile and risk related issues 
the rmc is a cross functional body which includes  among others  the group chief executive officer  chief financial officer and chief risk officer 
the rmc oversees the effective management of the group s overall risk profile  including risks related to insurance  financial  credit and operational risks as well as their interactions 
the rmc acts as an interface between our risk committee and management  who are responsible for managing our business within defined risk tolerances 
the rmc reviews and formulates recommendations for  among other things  changes to the axis risk standards  the group s risk based capital methodology and risk tolerance limits 
group risk management below the oversight roles of the board and executive  we have several other layers of governance within our risk management framework 
management in each of our operating units is responsible in the first instance for both 
table of contents the risks and returns of their decisions 
management is the owner of risk management processes and is responsible for managing our business within defined risk tolerances 
the group risk department group risk  led by the group chief risk officer group cro  oversees risk taking activity throughout the group and provides guidance and support for risk management practices 
group risk is responsible for developing our risk management framework and overseeing adherence to the framework 
group risk also develops methods and processes for identifying  assessing and monitoring risk across the group based on systemic qualitative and quantitative analysis 
group risk is further responsible for monitoring and reporting the accumulation of specific types of risk  including catastrophe exposures and aggregate credit risk 
the group cro regularly reports risk matters to the group chief executive officer  senior management committees and the board 
our global risk management network also includes risk officers within our underwriting segments and investment department 
these local risk units  which have regular and close interaction with group risk  assist with embedding the risk management framework into our business 
internal audit  an independent  objective function provides assurance to the board on the effectiveness of our risk management framework 
this includes assurance that key business risks have been adequately identified and managed appropriately and that our system of internal control is operating effectively 
internal audit also coordinates risk based audits  compliance reviews and other specific initiatives to evaluate and address risk within targeted areas of our business 
our risk governance structure is further complemented by our legal department which seeks to mitigate legal and regulatory compliance risks 
risk landscape within our erm framework  we distinguish between the following key sources of risk strategic the unintended risk that can result as a by product of planning or executing a strategy  insurance the inherent uncertainty as to the occurrence  amount and timing of insurance liabilities transferred to us through the underwriting process  credit the risk of incurring financial loss due to diminished creditworthiness of our counterparties  investment risk of potential losses in our investment portfolio as a result of market risks  as well as risk inherent in individual securities  operational risks associated with our people  processes and systems  including external events  and liquidity the risk that we are unable to meet our short term financial obligations or raise funds to finance our commitments at an affordable cost 
strategic risk strategic risk is a type of business risk 
it is the risk of change in value due to the inability to pursue an opportunity  implement appropriate business plans and strategies  make decisions  allocate resources  or adapt to changes in the external environment 

table of contents at axis  strategic decision making is supported by a strong risk management infrastructure and culture 
what we learn about risk through our monitoring  reporting and control processes provides important feedback in terms of reevaluating our risks and  therefore  reevaluating our business strategy 
the pre emptive management of emerging risks is embedded within the axis erm framework 
the company has a systemic framework for identifying and evaluating risks that we face  as well as responding to emerging threats 
in terms of underwriting strategy  the group undertakes a detailed annual business planning process  which is overseen by the group executive committee and individual business segment boards 
as part of this process  our economic capital model is used to generate risk adjusted returns by line of business from which the effectiveness of alternative underwriting strategies can then be tested 
the modeled returns are then reviewed and supplemented with management s judgment and business experience and expertise 
our economic capital model allows us to use consistent risk measurement across the group and assess whether changing business strategies remain in line with group s objectives and risk tolerances 
the group executive committee approves material strategic decisions and establishes and monitors boundaries in which the segments operate 
the executive committee has dedicated annual strategic planning meetings which include a review of the short and long term underwriting strategies and plans of each segment 
with respect to investment strategy  as part of the strategic asset allocation saa process  different asset strategies are simulated  allowing for an evaluation of the best portfolio based on both our reward goals and risk constraints 
the finance committee of the board approves the overall saa and reviews investments guidelines to ensure these are consistent with the company s overall goals  strategies and objectives 
the investment committee  which comprises senior management  oversees the implementation of the investment strategy 
underwriting risk since our inception in  we have expanded our international underwriting presence  with offices in bermuda  the us  europe  singapore  canada and australia 
our disciplined underwriting approach coupled with an extensive group wide peer review process has enabled us to manage this growth in a controlled and consistent manner 
this  coupled with our focus on maintaining high levels of experience in our underwriting teams  has ensured that our risk profile aligns closely with our defined risk appetite 
we emphasize quality of underwriting rather than volume of business or market share 
a critical element of our management of insurance risk is our rigorous peer review process which allows us to monitor market conditions and aggregations risk by risk  at the highest levels within the company 
underwriting is also conducted in accordance with other rigorous protocols  including underwriting guidelines which provide a framework for consistent pricing and risk analysis and ensuring alignment to our risk appetite 
there are well defined escalation processes in place  which  for certain business  require approval by the group cro and or rmc 
another key component of our mitigation of insurance risk is the purchase of reinsurance 
the business that we accept is not always fully retained  but instead portions may be reinsured 
we have a centralized reinsurance purchasing group  which coordinates our reinsurance purchasing as part of our overall risk management strategy 
we also have significant audit coverage across our underwriting segments  including management initiated audits mias 
mias are audits of underwriting files performed by teams independent of those who originated the transactions  the purpose of which is to test the robustness of the company s underwriting and operating processes and to recognize any early indicators of future trends in our operational risk 

table of contents modeling natural peril catastrophes natural peril catastrophic risk is our largest aggregate exposure 
in managing this risk  we are concerned with both the loss of capital due to a single event and the loss of capital that would occur from multiple but perhaps small events in any year 
natural catastrophes such as earthquakes  storms and floods represent a challenge for risk management due to their accumulation potential and occurrence volatility 
we use multiple commercial vendor models to price and accumulate risks 
these models cover the major peril regions where we face potential exposure 
in our reinsurance segment  we have also developed an internal proprietary application which allows us to track the results from various models for both pricing and aggregation purposes 
modeling allows us to simulate many hypothetical loss scenarios to supplement our experienced underwriting judgment 
we centrally oversee our modeling for consistency in approach and form a global perspective on our group wide accumulations 
we regularly refine our modeling methodology and have a governance process in place to review changes in vendor models 
we impose limits on natural peril catastrophe risk exposure at the group level 
based on our current tolerance  we are not willing to lose more than of our prior year end common equity for a modeled single occurrence in year return period probable maximum net loss 
we impose these limits on probable maximum losses in any one zone from a single event 
a zone is a geographical area in which insurance risks are considered to be correlated to a single catastrophe event 
our executive management receives regular reports on our group wide total natural peril exposures by peril and zone to ensure active monitoring of our risk positions 
the table below shows our net modeled loss estimates to the corresponding peak natural catastrophe territories at january  and we have developed these loss estimates using multiple commercially available catastrophe models and our own assessments for non vendor modeled exposures 
these estimates include assumptions regarding the location  size and magnitude of an event  the frequency of events  the construction type and a property s susceptibility to damage in a zone  and the cost of rebuilding property in a territory 
loss estimates for non us territories will be subject to foreign exchange rates  although we may mitigate this currency variability from a financial statement point of view 
return period refers to the frequency with which losses of a given amount or greater are expected to occur 
at january  in millions of us dollars territory peril year return period year return period year return period year return period year return period year return period us hurricane   california earthquake  europe windstorm japan earthquake japan windstorm 
table of contents the following table provides our estimate of industry exposures for the corresponding scenarios above at january  in billions of us dollars territory peril year return period year return period year return period year return period year return period year return period us hurricane california earthquake europe windstorm japan earthquake japan windstorm the figures take into account the fact that an event may trigger claims in a number of lines of business 
for instance  our us hurricane modeling includes  among other things  the estimated pre tax impact to our financial results arising from our catastrophe  property  engineering  energy  marine and aviation lines of business 
as indicated in the table above  our modeled single occurrence in year return period us hurricane probable maximum loss  net of reinsurance  is approximately billion or of shareholders equity at december  
according to our modeling  there is a one percent chance that on an annual basis  our losses incurred in any single us hurricane event could be in excess of billion 
conversely  there is a chance that on an annual basis  the loss from a single us hurricane will fall below billion 
we estimate that  an event that gave rise to such hypothetical loss levels  at this return period  would cause industry losses of approximately billion  resulting in an estimated market share of insured losses for us of around 
our probable maximum loss to us hurricane increased during primarily due to a reduction in the reinsurance protection we purchase within our insurance segment 
the decrease in our european wind probable maximum loss during the year largely relates to changes in the vendor models we use 
managing risks from man made catastrophes similar to our management of natural peril catastrophe exposures  we also take a similar focused and analytical approach to our management of man made catastrophes 
man made catastrophes  which include such risks as train collisions  airplane crashes  hotel fires or terrorism  are harder to model in terms of assumptions regarding intensity and frequency 
for these risks we couple the vendor models where available with our bespoke modeling and underwriting judgment and expertise 
this allows us to take advantage of business opportunities relating to man made catastrophe exposures particularly where we can measure and limit the risk sufficiently as well as obtain risk adequate pricing 
as an example of our approach  our assessment of terrorism risk is based on a mixture of qualitative and quantitative data eg for estimating property damage  business interruption  mortality and morbidity subsequent to an attack of a predefined magnitude  which we use to control  limit and manage our aggregate terrorism exposure 
we use vendor modeling and bespoke modeling tools to measure accumulations around potential terrorism accumulation zones on a deterministic and probabilistic basis 
we supplement the results of our modeling with underwriting judgment 

table of contents managing reserving risk our loss reserving process demands data quality and reliability and requires a quantitative and qualitative review of both our overall reserves and individual large claims 
within a structured control framework  claims information is communicated on a regular basis throughout our organization  including to senior management  to provide an increased awareness regarding the losses that have taken place throughout the insurance markets 
the detailed and analytical reserving approach that follows is designed to absorb and understand the latest information on our reported and unreported claims  to recognize the resultant exposure as quickly as possible  no matter how large  and above all else  to make appropriate and realistic provisions in our financial statements 
we have well established policies for determining carried reserves  which we endeavor to apply consistently over time 
reserving for long tail lines of business represents the most significant reserving risk for us 
when loss trends prove to be higher than those underlying our reserving assumptions  the risk is greater because of a stacking up effect for long tail business  we carry reserves to cover claims arising from several years of underwriting activity and these reserves are likely to be adversely affected by unfavorable loss trends 
we manage and mitigate reserving risk on long tail business in a variety of ways 
first  we limit the amount of long tail business we write in line with maintaining a well balanced and diversified global portfolio of business 
in  our long tail net premiums written namely liability and motor business represented of our consolidated total 
we purchase reinsurance on the liability business written in our insurance segment to reduce our net positions 
secondly  we follow a disciplined underwriting process that utilizes all available information  including industry trends 
we also limit the amount of occurrence based business that we write 
managing claims handling risk in accepting risk  we are committing to the payment of claims and therefore these risks must be understood and controlled 
we have claims teams located throughout our main underwriting segments 
our claim teams include a diverse group of experienced professionals  including claims adjusters and attorneys 
we also use approved external service providers  such as independent adjusters and appraisers  surveyors  accountants  investigators and specialist attorneys  as appropriate 
we maintain claims handling guidelines and claims reporting control and escalation procedures in all our claims units 
to ensure that claims are handled and reported in accordance with these guidelines  all large claims matters are reviewed during weekly claims meetings 
the minutes from each meeting also are circulated to our underwriters  senior management and others involved in the reserving process 
to maintain communication between underwriting and claims teams  claims personnel regularly report at underwriting meetings and frequently attend client meetings 
axis fosters a strong culture of review among its claims teams 
this includes management initiated audits  whereby senior claims handlers from other claims units audit a sample of claims files in other claims units 
the process is designed to ensure consistency between the claims units and to develop group wide best practices 
when we receive notice of a claim  regardless of size  it is recorded within our underwriting and claims system 
to assist with the reporting of significant claims  we have also developed a large claims information database  or lcid 
the database is primarily used to produce flash reports for significant events and potential losses  regardless of whether we have exposure 
the system allows a direct notification to be promptly communicated to underwriters and senior management worldwide 
similarly  for natural peril catastrophes  we have developed a catastrophe database that allows for the gathering  blending and reporting of loss information as it develops from early modeled results to fully adjusted and paid losses 

table of contents credit risk credit risk represents the risk of incurring financial loss due to diminished creditworthiness eroding credit rating and  ultimately  default among our third party counterparties  related to  but not limited to  cash and cash equivalents  investments  premium receivables  unpaid reinsurance recoverable balances and derivatives 
additionally  we have credit risk exposure within our underwriting portfolios 
our most significant exposures to credit risk are discussed further below 
credit risk relating to our fixed maturities with our fixed maturity investment portfolio  which represents approximately billion or of our total assets  we are exposed to potential losses arising from the diminished creditworthiness of issuers of bonds as well as third party counterparties such as custodians 
we limit such credit risk through diversification  issuer exposure limitation graded by ratings and  with respect to custodians  through contractual and other legal remedies 
excluding us treasury and agency securities  we limit our concentration of credit risk to any single corporate issuer to or less of our fixed maturities portfolio for securities rated a or above and or less of our fixed maturities portfolio for securities rated below a 
credit risk relating to reinsurance recoverable assets within our reinsurance purchasing activities  we are exposed to the credit risk of a reinsurer failing to meet its obligations under our reinsurance contracts 
to help mitigate this  all of our reinsurance purchasing is subject to financial security requirements specified by our reinsurance security committee 
this committee  comprising senior management personnel  maintains a list of approved reinsurers  performs credit risk assessments for potential new reinsurers  regularly monitors approved reinsurers with consideration for events which may have a material impact on their creditworthiness  recommends counterparty tolerance levels for different types of ceded business and monitors concentrations of credit risk 
this assessment considers a wide range of individual attributes  including a thorough review of the counterparty s financial strength  industry position and other qualitative factors 
we regularly monitor counterparty credit quality and exposures  with special monitoring of those cases that merit close attention 
it is generally our reinsurance security committee s policy to require reinsurers which do not meet our counterparty security requirements to provide adequate collateral 
we further mitigate credit risk by diversifying our exposure by counterparty 
we also maintain a provision for uncollectible balances  see item critical accounting estimates reinsurance recoverable for further information 
credit risk relating to our underwriting portfolio in our insurance segment  we provide credit insurance primarily for lenders financial institutions seeking to mitigate the risk of non payment from their borrowers primarily in emerging markets 
this product has complemented our more traditional political risk insurance business in recent years 
for the credit insurance contracts  it is necessary for the buyer of the insurance  most often a bank  to hold an insured asset  most often an underlying loan  in order to claim compensation under the insurance contract 
the vast majority of the credit insurance provided is for single name illiquid risks  primarily in the form of senior secured bank loans that can be individually analyzed and underwritten 
as part of this underwriting process  an evaluation of credit worthiness and reputation of the obligor is critical and forms the cornerstone of the underwriting process 
we generally require that our clients retain a share of each transaction that we insure 
a key element to our underwriting analysis is the assessment of recovery in the event of default and  accordingly  the strength of the collateral and the enforceability of rights to the collateral are paramount 
we avoid insurance for structured finance products 
table of contents defined by pools of risks and insurance for synthetic products that would expose us to mark to market losses 
we also seek to avoid terms in our credit insurance contracts which introduce liquidity risk  most notably  in the form of a collateralization requirement upon a ratings downgrade 
we also provide protection against sovereign default or sovereign actions that result in impairment of cross border investments for banks and corporations 
our contracts generally include warranties  representations  exclusions and waiting periods 
under most of our policies  a loss payment is made in the event the debtor failed to pay our client when payment is due subject to a waiting period of up to days 
in our reinsurance segment  we provide reinsurance of credit and bond insurers exposed to the risks of financial loss arising from non payment of trade receivables covered by a policy credit insurance or non performance bonding 
our credit insurance exposures are concentrated primarily within western european economies  while our bond exposures are concentrated primarily within latin american and western european economies 
our insureds are generally able to reduce or cancel limits under whole turnover credit insurance at any time without prior notice 
this enables our insureds to act quickly to specific distressed credits and therefore the potential loss exposures can be significantly reduced 
credit risk aggregation we monitor and control the aggregation of credit risk on a group wide basis by assigning limits on maximum credit exposures by single obligors and groups  industry sector  country  region or other inter dependencies 
limits are based on a variety of factors including the prevailing economic environment and the nature of the underlying credit exposures 
the credit risk reporting process is supported by our group credit risk exposure database  which contains relevant information on counterparty details and credit risk exposures 
the database is accessible by management throughout the group  thus providing essential transparency to allow for the implementation of active exposure management strategies 
we also license third party databases to provide credit risk assessments 
credit risk aggregation is also managed through minimizing overlaps in underwriting  financing and investing activities 
for example  as per the investment guidelines for fixed maturity investments  the company is not permitted to invest in p c companies and there are limitations on emerging market investments due to emerging market exposure within the underwriting portfolios 
investment risk investment risk encompasses the risk of loss in our investment portfolio as a result of market risks  as well as risks inherent in individual securities 
market risks represent the adverse impact on our cash and investments resulting from fluctuations in interest rates inclusive of credit spreads  equity prices and foreign currency rates 
we manage the risks in our investment portfolio in a number of ways 
to maintain diversification and avoid aggregation of risks  we place limits on asset class and individual security exposures 
we monitor compliance with these limits on an ongoing basis 
further  our investment policy and guidelines do not permit the use of leverage in any of our fixed maturity portfolios 
we also manage the duration of our investment portfolio to approximate the anticipated duration of our re insurance liabilities  so that changes in interest rates have approximately offsetting economic value impacts on our assets and liabilities 
additionally  we manage foreign currency risk by seeking to match our estimated insurance and reinsurance liabilities payable in foreign currencies with assets  including cash and investments that are denominated in such currencies 
when necessary  we may also use derivatives  such as forward contracts and currency options  to economically hedge portions of our un matched foreign currency exposures 

table of contents we regularly stress test our investment portfolio using historical and hypothetical scenarios to analyze the impact of unusual market conditions and to ensure potential investment losses remain within our risk appetite 
operational risk operational risk represents the risk of financial loss as a result of inadequate processes  system failures  human error or external events 
we have specific processes and systems in place to focus continuously on high priority operational matters such as information security  managing business continuity  and combating fraud 
we maintain an operational loss event database which helps us better monitor and analyze potential operational risk and identify any potential trends within the business 
we manage transaction type operational risks on a regular basis through the application of strong process controls throughout our business 
in testing these controls  we supplement the work of our internal audit team  with regular underwriting and claim mias as described above 
a key task is keeping our business continuity plans up to date  with an emphasis on recovery from unexpected events such as a natural catastrophe and possibility of a pandemic 
during  we continued to review our business continuity planning procedures through cyclical planned tests  all of which were completed satisfactorily 
with respect to it risk  the dependency of our core processes on it is increasing  with corresponding implications for risk 
it is therefore important that we ensure the availability of applications and the integrity and security of critical data 
during  we implemented data synchronization architecture across our multi regional data centers to enhance the availability of our core processing systems  communication networks  and databases 
we also expanded our intrusion prevention monitoring  anti malware capability  email resilience  and security of mobile devices  applications  and data to meet the demands of a more versatile and dispersed workforce 
our use of third party vendors exposes us to a number of increased operational risks  including the risk of security breaches  fraud  non compliance with laws and regulations or internal guidelines and inadequate service 
we manage material third party vendor risk  by  among other things  performing a thorough risk assessment on potential large vendors  reviewing a vendor s financial stability  ability to provide ongoing service  business continuity planning and its scalability up or down 
in  we introduced the axis global outsourcing policy to help ensure the consistent management of outsourcing arrangements across the group 
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that the group does not have sufficient liquid financial resources to meet its obligations when they fall due  or would have to incur excessive costs to do so 
our policy is to maintain adequate liquidity and contingent liquidity to meet our liquidity needs under both normal and stressed conditions 
to achieve this  we assess  monitor and manage our liquidity needs on an ongoing basis 
we maintain sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet expected outflows 
in addition  we maintain internal liquidity sources that cover the group s potential liquidity needs  including under stressed conditions 
the group takes into account the amount  permanence of availability and speed of accessibility of the sources 
we centrally maintain committed borrowing facilities  as well as access to diverse funding sources to cover contingencies 
funding sources include asset sales  external debt issuances and lines of credit 

table of contents as part of our liquidity risk management  we also place limits on the maximum percentage of cash and investments which may be in a restricted form as well as limits on the percentage of our investment portfolio that is not readily realizable 
for further information on our management of liquidity  refer to the liquidity and capital resources section of item capital management our economic capital model plays a significant role in solvency management and capital allocation 
our aim is to ensure that the axis group is adequately capitalized at all times  even following significant adverse events  and that all operating entities meet their respective capital requirements 
in addition  we employ a number of value based metrics to support business decision making which explicitly recognizes risk capital and the cost of capital 
in managing our capital position  we also consider additional external requirements of regulators and rating agencies 
while capital requirements imposed by regulators constitute a binding constraint  meeting rating agencies capital requirements forms a strategic business objective for us 
regulators and rating agencies impose minimum capital rules on the level of both the axis group s operating entities and on the axis group as a whole 
ensuring that our capital is sufficient to take advantage of market opportunities even in stressed market conditions is of key importance 
one of our overarching objectives therefore is to ensure that we maintain opportunistic capital in excess of the greater of our regulatory capital  aspiration rating agency capital and economic capital requirements 
the optimum level of opportunistic capital depends on a number of factors  including management s view of the risks and opportunities arising from our business operations 
our capital and solvency position is monitored and reported on a regular basis 
we have a set of measures and tools available to us to manage capital within our defined constraints and tolerances 
such measures are used as and when required and include cash dividends  share buy backs  issuances of shares or debt and purchase of reinsurance 
economic capital adequacy we use our proprietary economic capital model to determine a base economic capital requirement that captures the potential for severe  but rare  aggregate losses over a one year time horizon 
although our economic capital requirement is based on extreme events  it can also be applied towards managing the risks resulting from reasonably possible smaller adverse events that could occur in the near term  because the results allow us to analyze our exposure to each source of risk both separately and in aggregate 
our economic capital model is regularly updated to reflect changes in our business and the external environment 
regulatory capital adequacy in each country in which the group operates  the local regulator specifies the minimum amount and type of capital that each of the regulated entities must hold in addition to their liabilities 
the group targets to hold  in addition to the minimum capital required to comply with the solvency requirements  an adequate buffer to ensure that each of its regulated subsidiaries meets the local capital requirements 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements  under item for further information 

table of contents rating agency capital adequacy rating agencies apply their own models to evaluate the relationship between the required risk capital for a company or group and its available capital resources 
we maintain a continuous dialogue with rating agencies regarding the assessment of our capital adequacy 
the financial strength ratings of the group s main operating entities are an important element of our competitive position 
for further information on our financial strength refer to the liquidity and capital resources section in item of this report 
regulation general the business of insurance and reinsurance is regulated in most countries  although the degree and type of regulation varies significantly from one jurisdiction to another 
in addition  many jurisdictions are currently evaluating changes to their regulation and axis is monitoring these potential developments 
to the extent axis is aware of impending changes in regulation  we designate project teams to prepare the organization to comply on a timely basis with such anticipated changes 
the following describes the current material regulations under which the company operates 
bermuda as a holding company  axis capital is not subject to bermuda insurance regulations

table of contents item a risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this report  including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the occurrence of natural and man made disasters 
we have substantial exposure to unexpected losses resulting from natural disasters  man made catastrophes and other catastrophe events 
catastrophes can be caused by various events  including hurricanes  typhoons  earthquakes  hailstorms  explosions  severe winter weather  fires  and other natural or man made disasters 
the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable and our losses from catastrophes could be substantial 
increases in the values and concentrations of insured property may increase the severity of these occurrences in the future 
also  changes in global climate conditions may further increase the frequency and severity of catastrophe activity and losses in the future 
as examples of the impact of catastrophe events  in we recognized net losses and loss expenses of million as a result of the chilean and new zealand earthquakes and in we recognized million of losses and loss expenses in relation to hurricanes ike and gustav 
these events materially reduced our net income for those years 
although we attempt to manage our exposure to such events through the use of underwriting controls and the purchase of third party reinsurance  catastrophe events are inherently unpredictable and the actual nature of such events when they occur could be more frequent or severe than contemplated in our pricing and risk management expectations 
as a result  the occurrence of one or more catastrophe events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
the insurance and reinsurance business is historically cyclical  and we expect to experience periods with excess underwriting capacity and unfavorable premium rates 
the insurance and reinsurance business historically has been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted favorable premium levels 
an increase in premium levels is often offset by an increasing supply of insurance and reinsurance capacity  either by capital provided by new entrants or by the commitment of additional capital by existing insurers or reinsurers  which may cause prices to decrease 
any of these factors could lead to a significant reduction in premium rates  less favorable policy terms and fewer submissions for our underwriting services 
in addition to these considerations  changes in the frequency and severity of losses suffered by insureds and insurers may affect the cycles of the insurance and reinsurance business significantly 
in recent years  we have experienced a softening market cycle throughout many of our property and liability lines of business  with increased competition  surplus underwriting capacity and deteriorating rates  terms and conditions all having an impact on our ability to write business 
our investment portfolio is exposed to significant capital markets risk related to changes in interest rates  credit spreads and equity prices as well as other investment risks  which may adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
the performance of our cash and investments portfolio has a significant impact on our financial results 
a failure to successfully execute our investment strategy could have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents our investment portfolio is subject to a variety of market risks  including risks relating to general economic conditions  interest rate fluctuations  equity price risk  foreign currency movements  pre payment or reinvestment risk  liquidity risk and credit risk 
although we attempt to manage market risks through  among other things  stressing diversification and conservation of principal and liquidity in our investment guidelines  it is possible that  in periods of economic weakness or periods of turmoil in capital markets  we may experience significant losses in our portfolio 
our fixed maturities  which represent of our total investments at december   may be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates 
increases in interest rates could cause the fair value of our investment portfolio to decrease  resulting in a lower book value 
conversely  a declining interest rate environment  such as that noted in recent periods  can result in reductions in our investment yield as new funds and proceeds from maturing fixed maturity securities are invested at lower rates 
this reduces our overall profitability 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  inflation  domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control 
our fixed maturities may also be adversely impacted by fluctuations in credit spreads 
a credit spread is the difference between the yield on the fixed maturity security of a particular borrower or a class of borrowers with a specified credit rating and the yield of a fixed maturity us treasury security of similar maturity 
accordingly  as credit spreads widen  the fair value of a non us treasury fixed maturity security will underperform a us treasury security of similar maturity 
given our reliance on external investment managers  we are also exposed to operational risks  which may include  but are not limited to  a failure to follow our investment guidelines  technological and staffing deficiencies and inadequate disaster recovery plans 
the persistence of the recent financial crisis or recurrence of a similar crisis could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition 
in recent years  worldwide financial markets experienced unprecedented volatility and disruption including  among other things  dislocation in the mortgage and asset backed securities markets  deleveraging and decreased liquidity generally  widening of credit spreads  bankruptcies and government intervention in a number of large financial institutions 
these events resulted in extraordinary responses by governments worldwide  including the enactment of the emergency economic stabilization act of and the american recovery and reinvestment act in in the us this market turmoil affected among other aspects of our business the demand for and claims made under our products  the ability of customers  counterparties and others to establish or maintain their relationships with us  our ability to access and efficiently use internal and external capital resources and our investment performance 
although there have been some indicators of stabilization in the financial markets during  there continues to be significant uncertainty regarding the timeline for a full global economic recovery 
as such  evolving market conditions may continue to affect our results of operations  financial position and capital resources 
in the event that there is further deterioration or volatility in financial markets or general economic conditions  it could result in a prolonged economic downturn or recession and our results of operations  financial position and or liquidity  and competitive landscape could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents we could face unanticipated losses from war  terrorism and political unrest  and these or other unanticipated losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and or liquidity 
we have substantial exposure to unexpected losses resulting from war  acts of terrorism and political instability 
in certain instances  we specifically insure and reinsure risks resulting from acts of terrorism 
even in cases where we attempt to exclude losses from terrorism and certain other similar risks from some coverages written by us  there can be no assurance that a court or arbitration panel will interpret policy language or otherwise issue a ruling favorable to us 
accordingly  we can offer no assurance that our reserves will be adequate to cover losses should they materialize 
we have limited terrorism coverage in our own reinsurance program for our exposure to catastrophe losses related to acts of terrorism 
furthermore  although the terrorism risk insurance extension act of triea provides benefits in the event of certain acts of terrorism  those benefits are subject to a deductible and to other limitations 
under triea  once our losses attributable to certain acts of terrorism exceed of our direct commercial property and liability insurance premiums for the preceding calendar year  the federal government will reimburse us for of such losses in excess of this deductible 
notably  triea does not provide coverage for reinsurance losses or for losses involving nuclear  biological  chemical or radiological events 
given the unpredictable frequency and severity of terrorism losses  as well as the limited terrorism coverage in our own reinsurance program  future losses from acts of terrorism  particularly those in our reinsurance segment or those involving nuclear  biological  chemical or radiological events  could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and or liquidity in future periods 
triea may not be extended beyond our credit and political risk insurance line of business protects insureds with interests in foreign jurisdictions in the event governmental action prevents them from exercising their contractual rights and may also protect their assets against physical damage perils 
this may include risks arising from expropriation  forced abandonment  license cancellation  trade embargo  contract frustration  non payment  war on land or political violence including terrorism  revolution  insurrection and civil unrest 
political risk insurance is typically provided to financial institutions  equity investors  exporters  importers  export credit agencies and multilateral agencies in an array of industries  in connection with investments and contracts in both emerging markets and developed countries 
our credit and political risk line of business also protects insureds in foreign jurisdictions against non payment coverage on specific loan obligations as a result of commercial as well as political risk events 
the vast majority of the credit insurance provided is for single named illiquid risks  primarily in the form of secured bank loans that can be individually analyzed and written 
we avoid insurance for structured finance products defined by pools of risks and insurance for synthetic products that would expose us to mark to market losses 
we also avoid terms in our credit insurance contracts which introduce liquidity risk  most notably  in the form of a collateralization requirement upon a ratings downgrade 
although we also attempt to manage our exposure  by among other things  setting credit limits by country  region  industry and individual counterparty and regularly reviewing our aggregate exposures  the occurrence of one or more large losses on our credit insurance portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents if actual claims exceed our loss reserves  our financial results could be adversely affected 
while we believe that our loss reserves at december  are adequate  new information  events or circumstances  unknown at the original valuation date  may lead to future developments in our ultimate losses being significantly greater or less than the reserves currently provided 
the actual final cost of settling claims outstanding at december  as well as claims expected to arise from the unexpired period of risk is uncertain 
there are many other factors that would cause our reserves to increase or decrease  which include  but are not limited to  changes in claim severity  changes in the expected level of reported claims  judicial action changing the scope and or liability of coverage  changes in the legislative  regulatory  social and economic environment and unexpected changes in loss inflation 
the inherent potential volatility in a loss reserve estimate is particularly pronounced for a company like ours that has a limited operating history and  therefore  places reliance on industry benchmarks 
when establishing our single point best estimate of loss reserves at december   our management applied informed judgment to consider many qualitative factors that may not have been fully captured in actuarial estimates 
such factors included  but were not limited to the timing of the emergence of claims  volume and complexity of claims  social and judicial trends  potential severity of individual claims and the extent of internal historical loss data versus industry information due to our relatively short operating history 
changes to our previous estimate of prior year loss reserves can adversely impact the reported calendar year underwriting results if reserves prove to be deficient or favorably impact our reported results if reserves prove to be redundant 
if our net income is insufficient to absorb a required increase in our loss reserves  we would incur an operating loss and could incur a reduction of our capital 
the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain 
as industry practices and legal  judicial  social  political and other environmental conditions change  unexpected issues related to claims and coverage may emerge 
these issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims  such as the effects that recent disruptions in the credit markets could have on the number and size of reported claims under directors and officers and professional liability insurance lines of business 
in some instances  these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued the insurance or reinsurance contracts that are affected by the changes 
in addition  our actual losses may vary materially from our current estimate of the loss based on a number of factors see above 
as a result  the full extent of liability under an insurance or reinsurance contract may not be known for many years after such contract is issued and a loss occurs 
the failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
we seek to mitigate our loss exposure by writing a number of our insurance and reinsurance contracts on an excess of loss basis 
excess of loss insurance and reinsurance indemnifies the insured against losses in excess of a specified amount 
we generally limit the program size for each client on our insurance business and purchase reinsurance for many of our lines of business 
in the case of proportional reinsurance treaties  we seek per occurrence limitations or loss and loss expense ratio caps to limit the impact of losses from any one event 
in proportional reinsurance  the reinsurer shares a proportional part of the premiums and losses of the reinsured 
we also seek to limit our loss exposure by geographic diversification 
geographic zone limitations involve significant underwriting judgments  including the determination of the area of the zones and the inclusion of a particular policy within a particular zone s limits 
in addition  various provisions of our policies  such as limitations or exclusions from coverage or choice of forum negotiated to limit our risks may not be enforceable in the manner 
table of contents we intend 
we cannot be sure that any of these loss limitation methods will be effective and mitigate our loss exposure 
as a result of these risks  one or more catastrophe or other events could result in claims that substantially exceed our expectations  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
we utilize models to estimate our exposures to catastrophe events but there may be substantial differences between the model estimates and our actual experience 
catastrophe modeling utilizes a mix of historical data  scientific theory and mathematical methods 
we believe that there is considerable uncertainty in the data and parameter inputs for the insurance industry catastrophe models 
in that regard  there is no universal standard in the preparation of insured data for use in the models and the running of modeling software 
in our view  the accuracy of the models depends heavily on the availability of detailed insured loss data from actual recent large catastrophes 
due to the limited number of events  there is significant potential for substantial differences between the modeled loss estimate and actual company experience for a single large catastrophe event 
this potential difference could be even greater for perils with less modeled annual frequency  such as us earthquake  or less modeled annual severity  such as european windstorm 
we are also reliant upon third party estimates of industry insured exposures and there is significant variation possible around the relationship between our loss and that of the industry following a catastrophe event 
in addition  actual losses may increase if our reinsurers fail to meet their obligations to us or the reinsurance protection we purchase is exhausted or otherwise unavailable 
the risk associated with reinsurance underwriting could adversely affect us 
in our reinsurance business  we do not always separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under reinsurance treaties 
this is common among reinsurers 
therefore  we are largely dependent on the original underwriting decisions made by insurers that reinsure their liabilities  or ceding companies 
we are subject to the risk that the ceding companies may not have adequately evaluated the risks to be reinsured and that the premiums ceded may not adequately compensate us for the risks we assume 
we could be materially adversely affected to the extent that managing general agents  general agents and other producers in our program business exceed their underwriting authorities or otherwise breach obligations owed to us 
in program business conducted by our insurance segment  following our underwriting  financial  claims and information technology due diligence reviews  we authorize managing general agents  general agents and other producers to write business on our behalf within underwriting authorities prescribed by us 
once a program commences  we must rely on the underwriting controls of these agents to write business within the underwriting authorities provided by us 
although we monitor our programs on an ongoing basis  our monitoring efforts may not be adequate or our agents may exceed their underwriting authorities or otherwise breach obligations owed to us 
to the extent that our agents exceed their authorities or otherwise breach obligations owed to us in the future  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
if we choose to purchase reinsurance  we may be unable to do so  and if we successfully purchase reinsurance  we may be unable to collect 
we purchase reinsurance for our insurance and reinsurance operations in order to mitigate the volatility of losses upon our financial results 
a reinsurer s insolvency  or inability or refusal to make payments under the terms of its reinsurance agreement with us  could have a material adverse effect on our business because we remain liable to the insured 
from time to time  market conditions have limited  and in some cases have prevented  insurers and reinsurers from obtaining the types and amounts of reinsurance that they consider adequate for their business needs 

table of contents there is no guarantee our desired amounts of reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance will be available in the marketplace in the future 
in addition to capacity risk  the remaining capacity may not be on terms we deem appropriate or acceptable or with companies with whom we want to do business 
finally  we face counterparty risk whenever we purchase reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance 
consequently  the insolvency  inability or unwillingness of any of our present or future reinsurers to make timely payments to us under the terms of our reinsurance or retrocessional agreements could have an adverse effect on us 
if we experience difficulties with technology and or data security our ability to conduct our business might be negatively impacted 
while technology can streamline many business processes and ultimately reduce the cost of operations  technology initiatives present certain risks 
our business is dependent upon our employees and outsourcers ability to perform  in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion  necessary business functions  such as processing policies and paying claims 
a shutdown of  or inability to access one or more of our facilities  a power outage  or a failure of one or more of our information technology  telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis 
if sustained or repeated  such a business interruption  system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process business  provide customer service  pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions 
computer viruses  hackers and other external hazards including catastrophe events could expose our data systems to security breaches 
these risks could expose us to data loss and damages 
as a result  our ability to conduct our business might be adversely affected 
we outsource certain technology and business process functions to third parties and may do so increasingly in the future 
if we do not effectively develop and implement our outsourcing strategy  third party providers do not perform as anticipated or we experience technological or other problems with a transition  we may not realize productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience operational difficulties  increased costs and a loss of business 
our outsourcing of certain technology and business process functions to third parties may expose us to enhanced risk related to data security  which could result in monetary and reputational damages 
in addition  our ability to receive services from third party providers might be impacted by cultural differences  political instability  unanticipated regulatory requirements or policies 
as a result  our ability to conduct our business might be adversely affected 
our operating results may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations 
our reporting currency is the us dollar 
however  a portion of our gross premiums are written in currencies other than the us dollar 
a portion of our loss reserves and investments are also in non us currencies 
we may  from time to time  experience losses resulting from fluctuations in the values of these non us currencies  which could adversely affect our operating results 
although we attempt to manage our foreign currency exposure through matching of our major foreign denominated assets and liabilities  as well as through use of currency derivatives  there is no guarantee that we will successfully mitigate our exposure to foreign exchange losses 

table of contents we may require additional capital in the future  which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms 
our future capital requirements depend on many factors  including our ability to write new business successfully  the frequency and severity of catastrophe events and our ability to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses 
we may need to raise additional funds through financings 
if we are unable to do so  it may curtail our growth and reduce our assets 
any equity or debt financing  if available at all  may be on terms that are not favorable to us 
equity financings could be dilutive to our existing shareholders and could result in the issuance of securities that have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our other securities 
if we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all  our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our inability to obtain the necessary credit could affect our ability to offer reinsurance in certain markets 
neither axis specialty bermuda nor axis re ltd 
is licensed or admitted as an insurer or reinsurer in any jurisdiction other than bermuda  ireland and singapore 
because the us and some other jurisdictions do not permit insurance companies to take credit on their statutory financial statements for reinsurance obtained from unlicensed or non admitted insurers unless appropriate security mechanisms are in place  our reinsurance clients in these jurisdictions typically require axis specialty bermuda and axis re ltd 
to provide letters of credit or other collateral 
our credit facilities are used to post letters of credit 
however  if our credit facilities are not sufficient or if we are unable to renew our credit facilities or arrange for other types of security on commercially affordable terms  axis specialty bermuda and axis re ltd 
could be limited in their ability to write business for some of our clients 
a downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings by one or more rating agencies could materially and negatively impact our business  financial condition  results of operations and or liquidity 
as our ability to underwrite business is dependent upon the quality of our claims paying and financial strength ratings as evaluated by independent rating agencies  a downgrade  withdrawal or negative watch outlook by any of these institutions could cause our competitive position in the insurance and reinsurance industry to suffer and make it more difficult for us to market our products 
if we experience a credit rating downgrade  withdrawal or negative watch outlook in the future  we could incur higher borrowing costs and may have more limited means to access capital 
a downgrade  withdrawal or negative watch outlook could also result in a substantial loss of business for us as ceding companies and brokers that place such business may move to other insurers and reinsurers with higher credit ratings 
since we depend on a few brokers for a large portion of our revenues  loss of business provided by any one of them could adversely affect us 
we market our insurance and reinsurance worldwide primarily through insurance and reinsurance brokers and derive a significant portion of our business from a limited number of brokers 
mmc marsh mclennan companies  inc  including its subsidiary guy carpenter company  inc  aon corporation and willis group holdings ltd  provided a total of of our gross premiums written during our relationships with these brokers are based on the quality of our underwriting and claim services  as well as our financial strength ratings 
any deterioration in these factors could result in the brokers advising our clients to place their business with other insurers reinsurers 
in addition  these brokers also have  or may in the future acquire  ownership interests in insurance and reinsurance companies that may compete with us and these brokers may favor their own insurers reinsurers over other companies 
loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by one or more of these brokers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents our reliance on brokers subjects us to their credit risk 
in accordance with industry practice  we pay amounts owed on claims under our insurance and reinsurance contracts to brokers  and these brokers pay these amounts over to the clients that have purchased insurance or reinsurance from us 
although the law is unsettled and depends upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case  in some jurisdictions  if a broker fails to make such a payment  we might remain liable to the insured or ceding insurer for the deficiency 
conversely  in certain jurisdictions  when the insured or ceding insurer pays premiums for these policies to brokers for payment over to us  these premiums might be considered to have been paid and the insured or ceding insurer will no longer be liable to us for those amounts  whether or not we have actually received the premiums from the broker 
consequently  we assume a degree of credit risk associated with brokers with whom we transact business 
these risks are heightened during financial instability or an economic downturn or recession 
certain of our policyholders and intermediaries may not pay premiums owed to us due to bankruptcy or other reasons 
bankruptcy  liquidity problems  distressed financial condition or the general effects of economic recession may increase the risk that policyholders or intermediaries  such as insurance brokers  may not pay a part of or the full amount of premiums owed to us  despite an obligation to do so 
the terms of our contracts may not permit us to cancel our insurance even though we have not received payment 
if non payment becomes widespread  whether as a result of bankruptcy  lack of liquidity  adverse economic conditions  operational failure or otherwise  it could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and results of operations 
changes in current accounting practices and future pronouncements may materially impact our reported financial results 
developments in accounting practices may require us to incur considerable additional expenses to comply with such developments  particularly if we are required to prepare information relating to prior periods for comparative purposes or to apply the new requirements retroactively 
the impact of changes in current accounting practices and future pronouncements cannot be predicted but may affect the calculation of net income  net equity and other relevant financial statement line items 
in particular  the us financial accounting standards board fasb and the international accounting standards board iasb have been working jointly on an insurance contract project  resulting in the issuance of an exposure draft by the iasb in june and a discussion paper by the fasb in september the proposed guidance on accounting for and reporting of insurance contracts by these two boards would result in a material change from the current insurance accounting models toward more fair value based models 
additionally  each board recently issued exposure drafts for the accounting for and reporting of financial instruments  which may lead to further recognition of fair value changes through net income 
these two proposals could introduce significant volatility in the earnings of insurance industry participants 
there is considerable uncertainty with respect to the final outcome of these two proposed standards 
we could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more key executives or by an inability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
our success depends on our ability to retain the services of our existing key executives and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future 
the loss of the services of any of our key executives or the inability to hire and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business 
we do not maintain key man life insurance policies with respect to our employees  except for our chief executive officer and president  john r 
charman 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying  hiring or retaining successors on terms acceptable to us or on any terms 

table of contents under bermuda law  non bermudians  with some limited exceptions  may not engage in any gainful occupation in bermuda without an appropriate governmental work permit 
work permits may be granted or extended by the bermuda government only upon showing that  after proper public advertisement in most cases  no bermudian or spouse of a bermudian  holder of a permanent resident s certificate or holder of a working resident s certificate is available who meets the minimum standard requirements for the advertised position 
in  the bermuda government announced a new immigration policy limiting the duration of work permits to between six and nine years  with specified exemptions for key employees 
in march  the bermuda government announced an amendment to the immigration policy which expanded the categories of occupations recognized by the government as key and for which businesses are eligible to apply for holders of jobs in those categories to be exempt from the six to nine year term limits 
the categories include senior executives chief executive officers  presidents through vice presidents  managers with global responsibility  senior financial posts treasurers  chief financial officers through controllers  specialized qualified accountants  quantitative modeling analysts  certain legal professionals general counsel  specialist attorneys  qualified legal librarians and knowledge managers  senior insurance professionals senior underwriters  senior claims adjustors  experienced specialized brokers  actuaries  specialist investment traders analysts and senior information technology engineers managers 
all executive officers who work in our bermuda office that require work permits have obtained them 
competition in the insurance industry could reduce our growth and profitability 
the insurance and reinsurance industry is highly competitive 
we compete on an international and regional basis with major us  bermuda  european and other international insurers and reinsurers and with lloyds underwriting syndicates  some of which have greater financial  marketing and management resources than we do 
we also compete with new companies that continue to be formed to enter the insurance and reinsurance markets 
in addition  capital market participants have recently created alternative products that are intended to compete with reinsurance products 
increased competition could result in fewer submissions  lower premium rates and less favorable policy terms and conditions  which could have a material adverse effect on our growth and profitability 
the regulatory system under which we operate  and potential changes thereto  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in a time of financial uncertainty or a prolonged economic downturn or recession  regulators may choose to adopt more restrictive insurance laws and regulations  which may result in lower revenues and or higher costs and thus could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries conduct business globally 
our businesses in each of these jurisdictions are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision 
the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled require  among other things  that our subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of statutory capital and liquidity  meet solvency standards  participate in guaranty funds and submit to periodic examinations of their financial condition and compliance with underwriting regulations 
these laws and regulations also sometimes restrict payments of dividends and reductions of capital 
these statutes  regulations and policies may also restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to write insurance and reinsurance policies  to make certain investments and to distribute funds 
the purpose of insurance laws and regulations generally is to protect insureds and ceding insurance companies  not our shareholders 
we may not be able to comply fully with  or obtain appropriate exemptions from these statutes and regulations 
failure to comply with or to obtain appropriate authorizations and or exemptions under any applicable laws could result in restrictions on our ability to do business or undertake activities that are regulated in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business and could subject us to fines and other sanctions 
in addition  changes in the laws or regulations to which our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject or in the interpretation thereof by enforcement or regulatory agencies could have an adverse effect on our business 

table of contents potential government intervention in our industry as a result of recent events and instability in the marketplace for insurance products could hinder our flexibility and negatively affect the business opportunities that may be available to us in the market 
government intervention and the possibility of future government intervention have created uncertainty in the insurance and reinsurance markets 
government regulators are generally concerned with the protection of policyholders to the exclusion of other constituencies  including shareholders of insurers and reinsurers 
an example of such intervention was the expansion of the florida hurricane catastrophe fund in  which increased the capacity of the fund to compete against commercial providers of catastrophe reinsurance 
in addition  in december  the terrorism risk insurance revision and extension act of extended the material provisions of tria for an additional seven years to december  and expanded coverage to include domestic acts of terrorism 
in addition  in recent years certain us and us judicial and regulatory authorities  including us attorney s offices and certain state attorneys general  have commenced investigations into other business practices in the insurance industry 
while we cannot predict the exact nature  timing or scope of possible governmental initiatives  such proposals could adversely affect our business by  among other things providing reinsurance capacity in markets and to consumers that we target  requiring our further participation in industry pools and guaranty associations  expanding the scope of coverage under existing policies  eg  following large disasters  further regulating the terms of insurance and reinsurance policies  or disproportionately benefiting the companies of one country over those of another 
in addition  although the us federal government has not historically regulated insurance  there have been proposals from time to time  and especially after the recent global financial crisis  to impose federal regulation on the insurance industry 
on july   the president of the us signed dodd frank 
among other things  dodd frank establishes a federal insurance office within the us treasury 
this federal insurance office initially has limited regulatory authority and is empowered to gather data and information regarding the insurance industry  including conducting a study for submission to the us congress on how to modernize and improve insurance regulation in the us further  dodd frank gives the federal reserve supervisory authority over a number of financial services companies  including insurance companies  if they are designated by a two thirds vote of a financial stability oversight council as systemically important 
while we do not believe that we are systemically important  as defined in dodd frank  dodd frank or additional federal regulation that is adopted in the future could impose significant burdens on us  impact the ways in which we conduct our business  increase compliance costs  duplicate state regulation and or could result in a competitive disadvantage 
in addition  the european parliament has adopted a new directive referred to as solvency ii  which will be effective january  solvency ii will replace the existing eu insurance and reinsurance legislation and has three pillars i a risk based capital assessment  including the approval of internal capital models  ii a principles based risk governance framework  and iii external regulatory disclosure obligations 
our european subsidiaries axis specialty europe and axis re ltd 
are working towards becoming solvency ii compliant 
the eu will also be assessing bermuda for equivalence under the solvency ii directive and bermuda has embarked on legislative changes over its regulation of insurers and reinsurers  with a view to meeting the equivalency requirements 
axis specialty limited is likewise working towards meeting the new requirements of the bermuda 
table of contents monetary authority 
many of the detailed requirements are still being developed and tested by the eu the final implementation of this directive may require us to incur considerable expense to comply with its requirements and the adoption of new capital modeling rules could impact the levels of capital required to operate our bermuda and european subsidiaries 
solvency ii could also increase our compliance costs and impact the way in which we conduct our business and govern our subsidiaries 
our ability to pay dividends and to make payments on indebtedness may be constrained by our holding company structure 
axis capital is a holding company and has no direct operations of its own 
axis capital has no significant operations or assets other than its ownership of the shares of its operating insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries  axis specialty bermuda  axis re ltd  axis specialty europe  axis re us  axis specialty us  axis surplus and axis insurance co 
collectively  our insurance subsidiaries 
dividends and other permitted distributions from our insurance subsidiaries in some cases through our subsidiary holding companies  are our primary source of funds to meet ongoing cash requirements  including debt service payments and other expenses  and to pay dividends to our shareholders 
our insurance subsidiaries are subject to significant regulatory restrictions limiting their ability to declare and pay dividends and make distributions 
the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our cash requirements at the holding company level could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to pay dividends and make payments on our indebtedness 
global climate change may have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition if we are not able to adequately assess and reserve for the increased frequency and severity of catastrophes resulting from these environmental factors 
recent north atlantic hurricane seasons have shown a marked increase in windstorm activity  both in terms of total number of storms and their intensity 
atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases have increased dramatically since the industrial revolution and there is debate as to whether this has caused a gradual increase in global average temperatures 
increasing global average temperatures may continue in the future and could impact our business in the long term 
however  there is little consensus in the scientific community regarding the effect of global environmental factors on the frequency and severity catastrophes 
climatologists concur that heat from the ocean drives hurricanes  but they cannot agree on how much ocean temperature changes alter the annual outlook 
in addition  it is unclear whether rising sea temperatures are part of a longer cycle 
we attempt to mitigate the risk of financial exposure from climate change through our underwriting risk management practices 
this includes sensitivity to geographic concentrations of risks  the purchase of protective reinsurance and selective underwriting criteria which can include  but is not limited to  higher premiums and deductibles and more specifically excluded policy risks 
however  given the scientific uncertainty about the causes of increased frequency and severity of catastrophes and the lack of adequate predictive tools  a continuation and worsening of recent trends may have a material impact on our results of operation or financial condition 
axis capital is a bermuda company and it may be difficult for you to enforce judgments against it or its directors and executive officers 
axis capital is incorporated pursuant to the laws of bermuda and our business is based in bermuda 
in addition  some of our directors and officers reside outside the united states  and all or a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of such persons are located in jurisdictions outside the united states 
as a result  it may be difficult 
table of contents or impossible to effect service of process within the united states upon those persons or to recover against us or them on judgments of us courts  including judgments predicated upon civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws 
further  it may not be possible to bring a claim in bermuda against us or our directors and officers for violation of us federal securities laws because these laws may have no extraterritorial application under bermuda law and do not have force of law in bermuda 
a bermuda court may  however  impose civil liability  including the possibility of monetary damages  on us or our directors and officers if the facts alleged in a complaint constitute or give rise to a cause of action under bermuda law 
there are provisions in our charter documents that may reduce or increase the voting rights of our shares 
our bye laws generally provide that shareholders have one vote for each common share held by them and are entitled to vote  on a non cumulative basis  at all meetings of shareholders 
however  the voting rights exercisable by a shareholder may be limited so that certain persons or groups are not deemed to hold or more of the voting power conferred by our shares 
under these provisions  some shareholders may have the right to exercise their voting rights limited to less than one vote per share 
moreover  these provisions could have the effect of reducing the voting power of some shareholders who would not otherwise be subject to the limitation by virtue of their direct share ownership 
in addition  our board of directors may limit a shareholder s exercise of voting rights where it deems it necessary to do so to avoid adverse tax  legal or regulatory consequences 
we also have the authority under our bye laws to request information from any shareholder for the purpose of determining whether a shareholder s voting rights are to be limited pursuant to the bye laws 
if a shareholder fails to respond to our request for information or submits incomplete or inaccurate information in response to a request by us  we may  in our sole discretion  eliminate the shareholder s voting rights 
there are provisions in our bye laws that may restrict the ability to transfer common shares and which may require shareholders to sell their common shares 
our board of directors may decline to register a transfer of any common shares under some circumstances  including if they have reason to believe that any non de minimis adverse tax  regulatory or legal consequences to us  any of our subsidiaries or any of our shareholders may occur as a result of such transfer 
our bye laws also provide that if our board of directors determines that share ownership by a person may result in non de minimis adverse tax  legal or regulatory consequences to us  any of our subsidiaries or any of our shareholders  then we have the option  but not the obligation  to require that shareholder to sell to us or to third parties to whom we assign the repurchase right for fair value the minimum number of common shares held by such person which is necessary to eliminate the non de minimis adverse tax  legal or regulatory consequences 
applicable insurance laws may make it difficult to effect a change of control of our company 
before a person can acquire control of a us insurance company  prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where the domestic insurer is domiciled 
prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer  the state insurance commissioner will consider such factors as the financial strength of the acquiror  the integrity and management of the acquiror s board of directors and executive officers  the acquiror s plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer and any anti competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control 
generally  state statutes provide that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist if any person  directly or indirectly  owns  controls  holds with the power to vote  or holds proxies representing  or more of the voting securities of the domestic insurer 
because a person acquiring or more of our common shares would indirectly control the same percentage of the stock of the axis us subsidiaries  the insurance change of control laws of connecticut  illinois and new york would likely apply to such a transaction 

table of contents in addition  the insurance acts and regulations in ireland require that anyone acquiring or disposing of a direct or indirect holding in an irish authorized insurance company such as axis specialty europe that represents or more of the capital or of the voting rights of such company or that makes it possible to exercise a significant influence over the management of such company  or anyone who proposes to decrease or increase that holding to specified levels  must first notify the cbi of their intention to do so 
they also require any irish authorized insurance company that becomes aware of any acquisitions or disposals of its capital involving the specified levels to notify the cbi 
the specified levels are  and or such other level of ownership that results in the company becoming the acquiror s subsidiary within the meaning of article of the european communities non life insurance framework regulations the cbi has three months from the date of submission of a notification within which to oppose the proposed transaction if the cbi is not satisfied as to the suitability of the acquiror in view of the necessity to ensure prudent and sound management of the insurance undertaking concerned 
any person owning or more of the capital or voting rights or an amount that makes it possible to exercise a significant influence over the management of axis capital would be considered to have a qualifying holding in axis specialty europe 
while our bye laws limit the voting power of any shareholder to less than  there can be no assurance that the applicable regulatory body would agree that a shareholder who owned or more of our shares did not  because of the limitation on the voting power of such shares  control the applicable insurance subsidiary 
these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay  deter or prevent a change of control of the company  including transactions that some or all of our shareholders might consider to be desirable 
anti takeover provisions in our bye laws could impede an attempt to replace our directors or to effect a change in control  which could diminish the value of our common shares 
our bye laws contain provisions that may make it more difficult for shareholders to replace directors and could delay or prevent a change of control that a shareholder might consider favorable 
these provisions include a staggered board of directors  limitations on the ability of shareholders to remove directors other than for cause  limitations on voting rights and restrictions on transfer of our common shares 
these provisions may prevent a shareholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our shares offered by a bidder in a potential takeover 
even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt  these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our shares if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future 
we may become subject to taxes in bermuda after march   which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the bermuda minister of finance  under the exempted undertakings tax protection act of bermuda  as amended  has given each of axis capital and axis specialty bermuda an assurance that if any legislation is enacted in bermuda that would impose tax computed on profits or income  or computed on any capital asset  gain or appreciation  or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax  then the imposition of any such tax will not be applicable to axis capital  axis specialty bermuda or any of their respective operations  shares  debentures or other obligations until march  given the limited duration of the minister of finance s assurance  we cannot be certain that we will not be subject to any bermuda tax after march  the bermuda minister of finance announced in november that the assurance will be extended to but the required legislation for this has not yet been brought before the bermuda legislature 

table of contents our non us companies may be subject to non us tax that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
axis capital and axis specialty bermuda are bermuda companies  axis specialty holdings ireland limited axis ireland holdings  axis re ltd  axis specialty europe  and axis specialty global holdings limited are irish companies and axis specialty uk holdings limited axis uk holdings is a uk company  and sirius australia pty limited and dexta corporation pty limited are australian companies 
we intend to manage our business so that each of these companies will operate in such a manner that none of these companies should be subject to us tax other than us excise tax on insurance and reinsurance premium income attributable to insuring or reinsuring us risks and us withholding tax on some types of us source investment income  because none of these companies should be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the united states 
however  because there is considerable uncertainty as to the activities that constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the united states  we cannot be certain that the us internal revenue service irs will not contend successfully that any of axis capital or its non us subsidiaries is are engaged in a trade or business in the united states 
if axis capital or any of its non us subsidiaries were considered to be engaged in a trade or business in the united states  it could be subject to us corporate income and additional branch profits taxes on the portion of its earnings effectively connected to such us business 
if this were to be the case  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our non uk companies may be subject to non uk tax that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we intend to operate in such a manner so that none of our companies  other than axis uk holdings  should be resident in the united kingdom for tax purposes and that none of our companies  other than axis specialty europe  should have a permanent establishment in the united kingdom 
accordingly  we expect that none of our companies other than  axis uk holdings and axis specialty europe should be subject to uk tax 
nevertheless  because neither case law nor uk statutes conclusively define the activities that constitute trading in the united kingdom through a permanent establishment  the uk inland revenue might contend successfully that any of our companies  in addition to axis uk holdings and axis specialty europe  is are trading in the united kingdom through a permanent establishment in the united kingdom and therefore subject to uk tax 
in addition  there are circumstances in which companies that are neither resident in the united kingdom  nor entitled to the protection afforded by a double tax treaty between the united kingdom and the jurisdiction in which they are resident  may be exposed to income tax in the united kingdom other than by deduction or withholding on the profits of a trade carried on there even if that trade is not carried on through a permanent establishment 
we intend to operate in such a manner that none of our companies will fall within the charge to united kingdom income tax in this respect 
if any of our companies  other than axis uk holdings  were treated as being resident in the united kingdom for uk corporation tax purposes  or if any of our companies other than axis uk holdings  and axis specialty europe were to be treated as carrying on a trade in the united kingdom  whether or not through a permanent establishment  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our uk operations may be affected by future changes in uk tax law 
axis uk holdings should be treated as resident in the united kingdom by virtue of its being incorporated and managed there and accordingly be subject to uk tax in respect of its worldwide income and gains 
axis specialty europe is subject to uk corporation tax as a result of its having a permanent establishment in the united kingdom  however the charge to u 
k corporation tax is limited to profits including revenue profits and capital gains attributable directly or indirectly to such permanent establishment 
any change in the basis or rate of uk corporation tax could materially adversely affect the operations of these companies 

table of contents our non irish companies may be subject to irish tax that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we intend to operate in such a manner so that none of our companies  other than axis ireland holdings  axis re ltd  axis specialty europe  and axis specialty global holdings limited should be resident in ireland for tax purposes and that none of our companies  other than axis ireland holdings  axis re ltd  axis specialty europe  and axis specialty global holdings limited should be treated as carrying on a trade through a branch or agency in ireland 
accordingly  we expect that none of our companies other than axis ireland holdings  axis re ltd  axis specialty europe and axis specialty global holdings limited should be subject to irish corporation tax 
nevertheless  since the determination as to whether a company is resident in ireland is a question of fact to be determined based on a number of different factors and since neither case law nor irish legislation conclusively defines the activities that constitute trading in ireland through a branch or agency  the irish revenue commissioners might contend successfully that any of our companies  in addition to axis ireland holdings  axis re ltd  axis specialty europe and axis specialty global holdings limited  is resident in or otherwise trading through a branch or agency in ireland and therefore subject to irish corporation tax 
if this were the case  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
if corporate tax rates in ireland increase  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
trading income derived from the insurance and reinsurance businesses carried on in ireland by axis specialty europe and axis re ltd 
is generally taxed in ireland at a rate of 
over the past number of years  various eu member states have  from time to time  called for harmonization of the corporate tax base within the eu 
ireland  along with other member states  has consistently resisted any movement towards standardized corporate tax rates or tax base in the eu 
the government of ireland has also made clear its commitment to retain the rate of corporation tax 
if  however  tax laws in ireland change so as to increase the general corporation tax rate in ireland  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
if investments held by axis specialty europe or axis re ltd 
are determined not to be integral to the insurance and reinsurance businesses carried on by those companies  additional irish tax could be imposed and our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected 
based on administrative practice  taxable income derived from investments made by axis specialty europe and axis re ltd 
is generally taxed in ireland at the rate of on the grounds that such investments either form part of the permanent capital required by regulatory authorities  or are otherwise integral to the insurance and reinsurance businesses carried on by those companies 
axis specialty europe and axis re ltd 
intend to operate in such a manner so that the level of investments held by such companies does not exceed the amount that is integral to the insurance and reinsurance businesses carried on by axis specialty europe and axis re ltd 
if  however  investment income earned by axis specialty europe or axis re ltd 
exceeds these thresholds  or if the administrative practice of the irish revenue commissioners changes  irish corporation tax could apply to such investment income at a higher rate currently instead of the general rate  and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents the impact of bermuda s letter of commitment to the organization for economic cooperation and development to eliminate harmful tax practices is uncertain and could adversely affect our tax status in bermuda 
the organization for economic cooperation and development the oecd has published reports and launched a global dialogue among member and non member countries on measures to limit harmful tax competition 
these measures are largely directed at counteracting the effects of tax havens and preferential tax regimes in countries around the world 
in response to a number of measures taken and commitments by the government of bermuda in june   bermuda was listed as a jurisdiction that has substantially implemented those standards 
we are not able to predict what changes will arise from the commitment or whether such changes will subject us to additional taxes 
changes in us federal income tax law or the manner in which it is interpreted could materially adversely affect us 
legislation has been introduced in the us congress intended to eliminate some perceived tax advantages of companies including insurance companies that have legal domiciles outside the united states  but have certain us connections 
for example  legislation has been introduced in congress to limit the deductibility of reinsurance premiums paid by us companies to us affiliates 
a similar provision was included as part of president obama s proposed budget for fiscal year it is possible that this or similar legislation could be introduced in and enacted by the current congress or future congresses that could have an adverse impact on us 
in addition  existing interpretations of us federal income tax laws could change  also resulting in an adverse impact on us
