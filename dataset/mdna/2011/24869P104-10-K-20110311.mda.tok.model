item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data  and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
overview denny s corporation denny s is one of america s largest family style restaurant chains 
our fiscal year ends on the wednesday in december closest to december of each year 
as a result  a fifty third week is added to a fiscal year every five or six years 
fiscal included weeks of operations  whereas and each included weeks of operations 
our revenues are derived primarily from two sources the sale of food and beverages at our company owned restaurants and the collection of royalties and fees from restaurants operated by our franchisees under the denny s name 
sales and customer traffic at both company operated and franchised restaurants are affected by the success of our marketing campaigns  new product introductions and customer service  as well as external factors including competition  economic conditions affecting consumer spending and changes in guest tastes and preferences 
our operating costs are exposed to volatility in two main areas product costs and payroll and benefit costs 
many of the products sold in our restaurants are affected by commodity pricing and are  therefore  subject to price volatility 
this volatility is caused by factors that are fundamentally outside of our control and are often unpredictable 
in general  we purchase food products based on market prices or we set firm prices in purchase agreements with our vendors 
our ability to lock in prices on certain key commodities is imperative to control food costs in an environment in which many commodity prices are on the rise 
in addition  our continued success with menu management helps us to maintain favorable product costs 
our new everyday value menu along with other promotional activities are generally focused on menu items with lower food costs that still provide a compelling value to our customers 
the volatility of payroll and benefit costs results primarily from changes in wage rates and increases in labor related expenses such as medical benefit costs and workers compensation costs 
a number of our employees are paid the minimum wage 
accordingly  substantial increases in the minimum wage increase our labor costs 
additionally  changes in guest counts and investments in store level labor impact payroll and benefit costs as a percentage of sales 
our focus on the following initiatives has had a significant impact on our financial performance during and over the past several years franchise growth initiative during  we continued our franchise growth initiative  a strategic initiative to increase franchise restaurant development through the sale of certain geographic clusters of company restaurants to both current and new franchisees 
in  as a result of our fgi  we sold restaurant operations and certain related real estate to franchisees for net proceeds of million 
as of december   we have sold company restaurants since our fgi program began in early fulfilling the unit growth expectations of this program  certain franchisees that purchased company restaurants over the past several years have also signed development agreements to build additional new franchise restaurants 
in addition to franchise development agreements signed under our fgi  we have been negotiating development agreements outside of our fgi program under our market growth incentive plan 
the positive impact of these development programs is evident in the increasing number of franchise restaurant openings over the past several years 
conversion of flying j travel center restaurants during  denny was selected as the full service restaurant operator of choice for pilot travel centers llc 
also  during the year  pilot merged with flying j travel centers 
now named pilot flying j  the company is north america s largest retail operator of travel centers 
we began converting former flying j restaurant operations in july  and as of december   had converted sites  of which operate as company restaurants and of which operate as franchise restaurants 
specifically  our focus on these growth initiatives has impacted our financial performance as follows company restaurant sales have decreased from million in to million in primarily as a result of the sale of restaurants to franchisees 
the decline in company restaurant revenues is partially offset by increased royalty income derived from the growth in the franchise restaurant base resulting from both traditional development and the conversion of restaurants 
as a result  royalty income  which is included as a component of franchise and license revenue  has increased from million in to million in the resulting net reduction in total revenue related to our fgi is generally recovered by the benefits of a lower cost structure related to franchise and license revenues  a decrease in depreciation and amortization from the sale of restaurant related assets to franchisees from million in to million in and a reduction in interest expense resulting from the use of proceeds to reduce debt from million in to million in 
initial franchise fees  included as a component of franchise and license revenue  are generally recognized in the period in which a restaurant is sold to a franchisee or when a new unit is opened 
these initial fees are completely dependent on the number of restaurants sold to or opened by franchisees during a particular period  and as a result  can cause fluctuations in our total franchise and license revenue from year to year 
occupancy revenues  also included as a component of franchise and license revenue  result from leasing or subleasing restaurants to franchisees 
as a result of our fgi  occupancy revenues have increased from million in to million in additionally  when a restaurant is sold and leased or subleased to a franchisee  the occupancy costs related to these restaurants moves from costs of company restaurant sales to costs of franchise and license revenue to match the related occupancy revenue 
occupancy costs related to franchise units has increased from million in to million in gains on sales of assets are primarily dependent on the number of restaurants sold to franchisees during a particular period  and as a result  can cause fluctuations in net income from year to year 
as we near the completion of our fgi  gains on sales of assets will continue to decrease 
as a result of the development efforts described above  over the past five years we have transitioned from a portfolio mix of franchised and company operated to a portfolio mix of franchised and company operated 
our targeted portfolio mix is franchised and company operated 
we anticipate achieving this goal through a combination of new franchise unit growth and the sale of restaurants to franchisees over the next couple of years 
we expect that the future growth of the brand will come primarily from the development of franchise restaurants 
debt refinancing interest expense has a significant impact on our net income as a result of our indebtedness 
however  during and  we continued to reduce interest expense through a series of debt repayments using the proceeds generated from our fgi transactions  sales of real estate and cash flow from operations 
these repayments resulted in an overall debt reduction of approximately million during and million during on september   we refinanced our then existing credit facility and entered into an amended and restated senior secured credit agreement in an aggregate principal of million 
the new credit facility consists of a million five year senior secured revolver and a million six year senior secured term loan 
interest on the new credit facility was initially payable at per annum rates equal to libor plus basis points with a libor floor of for both the revolver and the term loan 
proceeds from the new credit facility were used principally to repurchase or redeem the then outstanding million aggregate principal amount of the notes and to repay the million term loan under the old credit facility 
interest on the term loan under the old credit facility was payable at per annum rates equal to libor plus basis points 
on march   subsequent to fiscal year  we completed a re pricing of the new credit facility to reduce the interest rate under the facility 
interest on the new credit facility  as amended  is payable at per annum rates equal to libor plus basis points  with a libor floor of for the term loan and no libor floor for the revolver 
the combination of lower debt balances and lower overall interest rates on our debt will continue to positively benefit our financial performance on an ongoing basis 
share repurchase the new credit facility permits the payment of cash dividends and or the purchase of denny s stock subject to certain limitations 
in november  the board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock 
as of december   we had repurchased  shares of common stock for approximately million under the share repurchase program

liquidity and capital resources summary of cash flows our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash generated from operations  borrowings under our new credit facility and  in recent years  cash proceeds from the sale of surplus properties and sales of restaurant operations to franchisees  to the extent allowed by our credit facility 
principal uses of cash are operating expenses  capital expenditures and debt repayments 
the following table presents a summary of our sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for the periods indicated fiscal year ended december  december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents the increase in operating cash flows is primarily the result of timing differences in marketing spending and the reduction in our interest payments 
we believe that our estimated cash flows from operations for  combined with our capacity for additional borrowings under our credit facility  will enable us to meet our anticipated cash requirements and fund capital expenditures over the next twelve months 
net cash flows used in investing activities were million for the year ended december  these cash flows include capital expenditures of million  partially offset by million in proceeds from asset sales and collections of notes receivable of million 
our principal capital requirements have been largely associated with the following fiscal year ended december  december  in thousands facilities new construction remodeling information technology strategic initiatives other total capital expenditures the increase in new construction is primarily the result of the conversion of restaurants at pilot flying j travel centers 
we generally expect our capital requirements to trend downward as we reduce our company owned restaurant portfolio and remain selective in our new restaurant investments 
in fiscal year  capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million  comprised primarily of costs related to the conversion of pilot flying j travel centers  facilities and new construction 
cash flows used in financing activities were million for the year ended december   which included long term debt payments of million  deferred financing costs of million and debt financing costs of million 
these uses of cash were partially offset by million of net borrowings on our credit facility  most of which related to our debt refinancing  as described below 
refinancing of credit facility and tender offer on september   our subsidiaries denny s  inc and denny s realty  llc  the borrowers  refinanced the old credit facility and entered into the new credit facility 
the new credit facility consists of a million five year senior secured revolver with a million letter of credit sublimit and a million six year senior secured term loan 
interest on the new credit facility was initially payable at per annum rates equal to libor plus basis points with a libor floor of 
the term loan was issued at reflecting an original issue discount oid of million 
the new credit facility includes an accordion feature that would allow the borrowers to increase the size of the facility by million subject to lender approval 
the maturity date for the revolver is september  the maturity date for the term loan is september  the term loan amortizes in equal quarterly installments equal to approximately per annum with all remaining amounts due on the maturity date 
mandatory prepayments will be required under certain circumstances and we will have the option to make certain prepayments under the new credit facility 
proceeds from the new credit facility were used principally to repurchase or redeem the million aggregate principal amount of the notes through a tender offer and subsequent redemption of the notes not tendered by noteholders pursuant to the tender offer and to repay the million term loan under the old credit facility 
the new credit facility is guaranteed by the company and its material subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and its subsidiaries  including the stock of the company s subsidiaries 
the new credit facility includes certain financial covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio  a maximum lease adjusted leverage ratio  a minimum fixed charged coverage ratio and limitations on capital expenditures 
these covenants are substantially similar to those that were contained in the old credit facility 
as a result of the debt refinancing  we recorded million of losses on early extinguishment of debt  consisting primarily of million of transaction costs  million from the write off of deferred financing costs and other costs related to the tender offer 
these losses are included as a component of other nonoperating expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
long term debt consisted of the following december  december  in thousands new credit facility revolver loans outstanding due september  term loans due september  old credit facility repaid during the year ended december  revolver loans outstanding due december  term loans due march  notes and debentures repaid during the year ended december  senior notes due october   interest payable semi annually other notes payable  maturing  payable in monthly installments with an interest rate of capital lease obligations total long term debt   unamortized discount  total long term debt  net  less current maturities and mandatory prepayments noncurrent portion of long term debt as of december   the term loan had a weighted average interest rate of 
we had outstanding letters of credit of million under our revolving letter of credit facility as of december  there were no revolving loans outstanding at december  these balances resulted in availability of million under the revolving facility 
on march   subsequent to fiscal year  we completed a re pricing of the new credit facility to reduce the interest rates under the facility 
interest on the new credit facility  as amended  is payable at per annum rates equal to libor plus basis points  with a libor floor of for the term loan and no libor floor for the revolver  compared with an interest rate of libor plus basis points and a libor floor of for both the revolver and the term loan prior to the re pricing 
contractual obligations our future contractual obligations and commitments at december  consisted of the following payments due by period total less than year years years years and thereafter in thousands long term debt capital lease obligations a operating lease obligations interest obligations a pension and other defined contribution plan obligations b purchase obligations c total a interest obligations represent payments related to our long term debt outstanding at december  for long term debt with variable rates  we have used the rate applicable at december  to project interest over the periods presented in the table above 
the capital lease obligation amounts above are inclusive of interest 
b pension and other defined contribution plan obligations are estimates based on facts and circumstances at december  amounts cannot currently be estimated for more than one year 
c purchase obligations include amounts payable under purchase contracts for food and non food products 
many of these agreements do not obligate us to purchase any specific volumes and include provisions that would allow us to cancel such agreements with appropriate notice 
for agreements with cancellation provisions  amounts included in the table above represent our estimate of purchase obligations during the periods presented if we were to cancel these contracts with appropriate notice 
unrecognized tax benefits are not included in the contractual obligations table as these liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations  and given the status of the examinations  we cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
at december   there were no unrecognized tax benefits including potential interest and penalties 
at december   our working capital deficit was million compared with million at december  the decrease in working capital deficit primarily resulted from a million decrease in accrued salaries and vacation and a million increase in assets held for sale 
we are able to operate with a substantial working capital deficit because restaurant operations and most food service operations are conducted primarily on a cash and cash equivalent basis with a low level of accounts receivable  rapid turnover allows a limited investment in inventories  and accounts payable for food  beverages and supplies usually become due after the receipt of cash from the related sales 
off balance sheet arrangements except for operating leases entered into the normal course of business  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to self insurance liabilities  impairment of long lived assets  restructuring and exit costs  income taxes and share based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  however  we believe that our estimates  including those for the above described items  are reasonable 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements self insurance liabilities 
we record liabilities for insurance claims during periods in which we have been insured under large deductible programs or have been self insured for our medical and dental claims and workers compensation  general product and automobile insurance liabilities 
maximum self insured retention  including defense costs per occurrence  ranges from million to million per individual claim for workers compensation and for general product and automobile liability 
the liabilities for prior and current estimated incurred losses are discounted to their present value based on expected loss payment patterns determined by independent actuaries using our actual historical payments 
these estimates include assumptions regarding claims frequency and severity as well as changes in our business environment  medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact our overall self insurance costs 
total discounted workers compensation and general liability insurance liabilities at december  and december  were million  reflecting a discount rate  and million  reflecting a discount rate  respectively 
the related undiscounted amounts at such dates were million and million  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment at the restaurant level on a quarterly basis  when assets are identified as held for sale or whenever changes or events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we assess impairment of restaurant level assets based on the operating cash flows of the restaurant  expected proceeds from the sale of assets and our plans for restaurant closings 
generally  all units with negative cash flows from operations for the most recent twelve months at each quarter end are included in our assessment 
in performing our assessment  we make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  including estimated proceeds from similar asset sales  and other factors to determine both the recoverability and the estimated fair value of the respective assets 
if the long lived assets of a restaurant are not recoverable based upon estimated future  undiscounted cash flows  we write the assets down to their fair value 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
during  and  we recorded impairment charges of million  million and million  respectively  for underperforming restaurants  including restaurants closed and company owned restaurants classified as held for sale 
these charges are included as a component of operating gains  losses and other charges  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
at december   we had a total of three restaurants with an aggregate net book value of approximately million  after taking into consideration impairment charges recorded  which had negative cash flows from operations for the most recent twelve months 
restructuring and exit costs 
as a result of changes in our organizational structure and in our portfolio of restaurants  we have recorded charges for restructuring and exit costs 
these costs consist primarily of the costs of future obligations related to closed units and severance and other restructuring charges for terminated employees 
these costs are included as a component of operating gains  losses and other charges  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
discounted liabilities for future lease costs and the fair value of related subleases of closed units are recorded when the units are closed 
all other costs related to closed units are expensed as incurred 
in assessing the discounted liabilities for future costs of obligations related to closed units  we make assumptions regarding amounts of future subleases 
if these assumptions or their related estimates change in the future  we may be required to record additional exit costs or reduce exit costs previously recorded 
exit costs recorded for each of the periods presented include the effect of such changes in estimates 
the most significant estimate included in our accrued exit costs liabilities relates to the timing and amount of estimated subleases 
at december   our total discounted liability for closed units was approximately million  net of million related to existing sublease agreements and million related to properties for which we expect to enter into sublease agreements in the future 
if any of the estimates noted above or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional exit costs or reduce exit costs previously recorded 
income taxes 
we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets  when necessary 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate will be recovered from future taxable income 
deferred tax assets do not include future tax benefits that we deem likely not to be realized 
share based compensation 
stock based compensation is estimated for equity awards at fair value at the grant date 
we determine the fair value of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
use of this option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
the fair value of restricted stock units containing a market condition is determined using the monte carlo valuation method  which utilizes multiple input variables to determine the probability of the company achieving the market condition 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of share based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized in the consolidated statements of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we have exposure to interest rate risk related to certain instruments entered into for other than trading purposes 
specifically  as of the end of fiscal  borrowings under the term loan and revolving credit facility bore interest at variable rates based on libor plus a spread of basis points per annum with a libor floor of 
subsequent to the end of fiscal  we completed a re pricing of the new credit facility to reduce the interest rate thereunder 
interest under the new credit facility  as amended  is payable at per annum rates equal to libor plus basis points  with a libor floor of for the term loan and no libor floor for the revolver 
we have utilized interest rate swaps in the past  and may chose to do so again in the future  to mitigate the interest rate risk related to our variable rate debt 
based on the levels of borrowings under the credit facility at december   if interest rates changed by basis points our annual cash flow and income before income taxes would change by approximately million 
this computation is determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the variable rate portion of the credit facility at december  however  the nature and amount of our borrowings under the credit facility may vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
the estimated fair value of our borrowings under the credit facility was approximately million compared with a book value of million at december  this computation is based on market quotations for the same or similar debt issues or the estimated borrowing rates available to us 
our other outstanding long term debt bears fixed rates of interest 
we also have exposure to interest rate risk related to our pension plan  other defined benefit plans and self insurance liabilities 
a basis point increase or decrease in discount rate would decrease or increase our projected benefit obligation related to our pension plan by approximately million and would impact the pension plan net periodic benefit cost by less than million 
the impact of a basis point increase or decrease in discount rate would decrease or increase our projected benefit obligation related to our other defined benefit plans by less than million while the plans net periodic benefit cost would remain flat 
a basis point increase or decrease in discount rate related to our self insurance liabilities would result in a decrease or increase of million  respectively 
commodity price risk we purchase certain food products  such as beef  poultry  pork  eggs and coffee  and utilities  such as gas and electricity  which are affected by commodity pricing and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  production problems  delivery difficulties and other factors that are outside our control and which are generally unpredictable 
changes in commodity prices affect us and our competitors generally and often simultaneously 
in general  we purchase food products and utilities based upon market prices established with vendors 
although many of the items purchased are subject to changes in commodity prices  the majority of our purchasing arrangements are structured to contain features that minimize price volatility by establishing fixed pricing and or price ceilings and floors 
we use these types of purchase arrangements to control costs as an alternative to using financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
in many cases  we believe we will be able to address commodity cost increases which are significant and appear to be long term in nature by adjusting our menu pricing or changing our product delivery strategy 
however  competitive circumstances could limit such actions and  in those circumstances  increases in commodity prices could lower our margins 
because of the often short term nature of commodity pricing aberrations and our ability to change menu pricing or product delivery strategies in response to commodity price increases  we believe that the impact of commodity price risk is not significant 
we have established a policy to identify  control and manage market risks which may arise from changes in interest rates  commodity prices and other relevant rates and prices 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes
