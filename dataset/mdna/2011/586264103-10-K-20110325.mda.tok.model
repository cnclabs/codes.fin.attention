item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide advanced semiconductor sensor and system solutions based on integrated mems technology and mixed signal circuit design 
we operate and manage our business in two reporting segments 
we develop  design  manufacture and market semiconductor sensor products  which we refer to as sensor products  based on micro electromechanical systems mems technology and advanced integrated circuit design  and sensor system solution products  which we refer to as system solution products  which incorporate sensors with on board computing  wireless communications and systems and application software solutions 
in making operating decisions  our chief executive officer  who is the chief operating decision maker  considers the gross profit results of the sensor product segment and the system solution product segment separately  but utilizes enterprise wide operating expense and earning results 
our sensor products combine proprietary thermal based mems technology and advanced analog mixed signal processing circuitry design into a single chip using a standard cmos process 
this approach allows us to provide sensor solutions at a lower cost  with higher performance and greater functionality than our competitors 
in addition  our technology platform allows us to easily integrate additional functions or create new sensors to expand into magnetic  touch and flow sensors and related applications 
our sensor products have a wide range of applications such as mobile phones  automotive safety systems and video projectors 
our system solution products consist of wireless sensors that connect the physical environment with enterprise management and information systems to provide advanced monitoring  automation and control solutions for a range of industries  as well as inertial systems that provide end users and systems integrators with mems based solutions for measurement of static and dynamic motion in a wide variety of challenging environments  including avionics  remotely operated vehicles  agricultural and construction vehicles  automotive test and wind power turbines 
our system solution products initially consisted primarily of the product lines we acquired from crossbow technology  inc in january  including the non military portion of crossbow s inertial navigation systems business and its wireless sensor network mote and eko environmental monitoring business 
in connection with the acquisition  crossbow employees  including engineering  sales and marketing personnel  joined our new operations in san jose  california 
the purchase price for the acquisition was million in cash 
the assets  liabilities and results of operations of the acquired business are included in our financial statements from the date of acquisition 
we manufacture our sensor products utilizing a semi fabless model by outsourcing the production of cmos wafers and completing the post cmos mems process in house 
by outsourcing the standard cmos manufacturing process  we are able to more efficiently manage our capital expenditures and cost of goods sold 
the system solution products that we acquired from crossbow technology were initially manufactured for us by crossbow under a manufacturing agreement that we entered into in connection with the acquisition 
we are in the process of migrating the manufacture of these products to china  with the objective of outsourcing most of the assembly process to third party contract assembly vendors and performing final testing and programming functions in house at our facility in wuxi 
we sell our products either to distributors  which then resell to oems and odms  or to oem and odm customers directly 
historically  a small number of our customers have accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue  and sales to our largest distributor customers and oem and odm customers have varied significantly 
this significant variation is in part due to the fact that our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term contracts 
although our distributors generally provide us with non binding rolling forecasts  our distributors generally have up to days prior to delivery to cancel or reschedule shipments pursuant to our distribution agreements 
this arrangement has added to the fluctuation and unpredictability of our sales 
because our products are a component of our customers products  our sales performance is significantly affected by the sales performance of our customers products 
it is difficult for us to accurately forecast our product demand because in the case where we sell our products to distributors  we may not know the identity of the distributor s oem and odm customers and information regarding their demand 
oem and odm customers products are complex and require significant time to define  design and ramp to volume production 
our sales cycle begins with our marketing and sales staff and application engineers engaging with our oem and odm customers system designers and management  which is typically a multi month  or even multi year  process 
if this process is successful  an oem and odm customer will decide to incorporate our solution in its product  which we refer to as a design win 
because the sales cycles for our products are long  we incur expenses to develop and sell our products  regardless of whether we achieve the design win and well in advance of generating revenue  if any  from those expenditures 
although we do not have long term purchase commitments from any of our distributor customers or oem and odm customers  once one of our products is incorporated into an oem s or odm s design  it is likely to remain a part of the design for the life cycle of its product 
we believe this to be the case because a redesign would generally be time consuming and expensive 
description of certain line items net sales net sales represent gross revenue net of an allowance for the estimated amount of product returns and sales rebates from our customers 
sales to distributors are made pursuant to distributor agreements  which allow for the return of goods under certain circumstances 
we recognize revenue in accordance with asc topic  revenue recognition 
while we also sell our products directly to oem manufacturers  sales to distributors account for a significant portion of our total revenue 
historically  our revenue has been derived primarily from shipments of our accelerometer products 
as a result of our crossbow acquisition in january  net sales of system solution products have increased substantially as a percentage of our net sales  and accounted for of our net sales in we expect this percentage will continue to increase in the primary factors that affect our revenue are the sales volumes and average selling prices of our products 
growth in our net sales has generally been attributable to the increase in the unit volumes of our products  as the average selling prices of our sensor products have tended to decline due to the following factors  among others the semiconductor component market is highly competitive  and as a result  the average selling prices of particular components generally experience rapid declines over the course of their respective product and technology life cycles 
this trend has been particularly evident recently in the market for mobile phone applications 
we seek to mitigate the impact of this trend on our business by continuing to rapidly design  develop and sell new generations of products with additional functionalities to replace older generation products  we may also reduce our product prices as we are able to increase our production yields by continuously improving the manufacturing efficiency or to reduce our manufacturing costs by re engineering our product and reducing the overall material cost  changes in our product mix may affect the average selling prices of our products 
for example  our products for consumer and mobile phone markets generally have lower average selling prices than products for the automotive market 
the average selling prices of products may also be affected by our strategy to increase market adoption of our products in certain markets  and we occasionally grant discounts or modified payment terms to our large customers or oem and odm customers for high volume purchases 
net sales by application in  net sales from industrial and other applications were the largest component of our total sales  representing of total net sales  as a result of the addition of revenue from the crossbow acquisition 
we expect that net sales from industrial and other applications will continue to be a major component of our total sales in net sales from automotive applications grew significantly in  representing of total net sales  primarily due to the increasing volume of our new automotive applications  as a result of increased commercial shipments by our customer autoliv of its vehicle stability control system incorporating our sensor products 
we expect our sales from automotive applications will continue to grow with our new applications and the recovery of the auto market 
to increase net sales from the automotive market  we will continue to seek to have our sensors designed into new automotive applications and to expand our customer base 
however  revenue increases  if any  from the automotive market will require significant time  as the development lead time in this market is generally longer than other markets in which we participate  and this market was disproportionately affected by the recent global downturn 
net sales from mobile phone applications represented of total net sales in  compared to in the reduction was due to severe price erosion affecting our accelerometer products and a decline in unit sales due to competition from lower priced mechanical switch and ball sensors 
however  we expect net sales from mobile phone applications will recover as we are ramping up in sales of our magnetic sensor to a major mobile phone manufacturer and have continued our efforts to win major global mobile phone accounts 
we believe that the introduction of our new series of ultra low cost accelerometers will help us regain china mobile phone customers 
net sales from consumer applications accounted for of total net sales in excluding net sales from industrial and other applications added by our crossbow acquisition  the percentage of our net sales attributable to consumer applications in would have been  slightly decreased from net sales from consumer applications have fluctuated historically as a result of the generally short life cycle of consumer electronics and changes in our customer base 
as our product offering and customer base for consumer applications continue to diversify  we expect net sales from consumer applications to fluctuate less 
the following table sets forth our net sales by application for the periods indicated by amount and as a percentage of our net sales dollar amounts in thousands 
for the year ended december  amount of sales amount of sales mobile phone consumer automotive industrial other total net sales by customer base our customers primarily consist of oems and odms  and distributors who resell to oems and odms 
historically  a small number of our customers have accounted for a substantial portion of our net sales 
however  the crossbow acquisition has broadened our customer base and we expect that customer concentration will decline in the near term 
customers that individually represented or more of our net sales  accounted in the aggregate for approximately of our net sales in compared with in the decrease in concentration of customers is primarily due to the broader customer accounts as a result of the crossbow acquisition 
we have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in demand from a significant number of customers  including many of our largest customers 
it is difficult for us to accurately forecast our product demand  particularly in the case of sales to our distributors  as we may not know the identity of the distributor s oem and odm customers and lack information regarding their demand 
occasionally  design changes in the products of our oem and odm customers have resulted in the loss of sales 
for example  a design change in a product of a large oem customer in for mobile phone applications resulted in a decrease of our sales to such customer in that customer accounted for of our net sales in net sales by product type our sales primarily consist of two product types sensor products that are used as components in our customers products  and system solution products  based on the technology acquired in our crossbow acquisition  that incorporate sensors with on board computing  wireless communications and systems and application software solutions and offer a complete system solution to our customers 
the following table sets forth our net sales by product type for the periods indicated by amount and as a percentage of our net sales dollar amounts in thousands 
for the year ended december  amount of sales amount of sales sensor products system solution products total net sales by geography our products are shipped to oem and odm customers worldwide 
however  we focus on different application markets among geographical regions 
in the greater china region  our revenue has historically been primarily derived from products for mobile phone applications 
we are also seeking to expand the consumer and industrial applications markets in the greater china region  for example  through the introduction of our new mems based gas flow meter 
in other asian countries excluding china and japan  we are seeking to grow market shares in the mobile phone and consumer applications 
in japan  our revenue has primarily been derived from products for consumer applications  particularly projectors 
we are also seeking to penetrate the automotive market in japan 
in north america  our revenue has primarily been derived from products for automotive applications 
the following table sets forth our net sales by geographical region for the periods indicated by amount and as a percentage of our net sales dollar amounts in thousands 
for the year ended december  amount of sales amount of sales asia excluding japan europe japan north america other total cost of goods sold we are a semi fabless company 
we outsource wafer production to third party foundries and complete the post cmos mems and most of the packaging  assembly and testing functions in house 
we also purchase our ceramic packaging materials from third party suppliers 
cost of goods sold consists of i cost of wafer  ceramic and other materials purchased from third parties  ii manufacturing overhead  primarily consisting of salaries and wages of our quality control employees and manufacturing related management employees  depreciation  and equipment and parts  iii direct labor  primarily consisting of salaries and wages of our manufacturing operators  and iv outsourced processing fees paid to third party packaging service providers 
our relationships with third party foundry and packaging service providers do not provide for guaranteed levels of production capacity at pre determined prices 
as a result  our outsourcing costs relating to wafer production  and to a lesser extent  packaging services  are susceptible to sudden changes based on conditions in the global semiconductor market and our service providers available capacity 
the system solution products that we acquired from crossbow technology were initially manufactured for us by crossbow under a manufacturing agreement that we entered into in connection with the acquisition 
we have migrated the manufacture of our wireless sensor network products to china  outsourcing most of the assembly process to third party contract assembly vendors and performing final testing and programming functions in house at our facility in wuxi 
we are continuing to migrate the manufacture of our inertial sensor systems products to china  and expect to complete that transition in the second half of gross profit and gross margin our gross margin has continued to decrease from in  to in and in our gross profit and gross margin are affected by a variety of factors  including average selling prices of our products  our product application mix  prices of wafers  excess and obsolete inventory  pricing by competitors  changes in production yields  and percentage of sales conducted through distributors 
our products for mobile phone applications  which are sold to distributor customers  have historically had lower margins than our products for automotive products  which are sold directly to our oem and odm customers  and this trend has accelerated recently 
in addition  in  we reduced our prices for accelerometers used in mobile phone applications  which allowed us to deplete inventories of our existing mobile phone application product and launch our newly introduced ultra low cost orientation sensor product  which contributed to the decrease in the sensor product gross margin in notwithstanding the relatively low margins in the mobile phone applications market  we will seek to increase our market share in that market by introducing improved ultra low cost products and new magnetic sensor products  in the goal of capitalizing on the significant potential for revenue growth in that market 
the gross margin from systems solution products  representing the product lines that we acquired from crossbow technology in the first quarter of  largely reflects the negotiated prices under the manufacturing agreement we entered into in connection with the acquisition 
as a result of our migration of manufacturing of these products to china  our gross margins from system solution products increased from in the first quarter of to in the fourth quarter of we expect the gross margins for our system solution products to continue to increase as we complete the transition to in house manufacturing 
research and development expenses research and development expenses are recognized as they are incurred and primarily consist of salaries and wages of research and development employees  research costs  primarily consisting of mask costs and prototype wafers  consulting fees paid for outside design services  travel and other expenses  and stock based compensation attributable to our research and development employees 
historically  research and development expenses have increased both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total net sales 
in  research and development expenses increased significantly due to the addition of acquired crossbow engineers in the first quarter of we expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to diversify into non accelerometer sensor products and system solution products 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of wages  salaries and commissions for our sales and marketing personnel  consulting expenses  primarily consisting of sales consulting services and software application consulting services  travel expenses  independent sales representatives commissions  office rental  market promotion and others expenses and stock based compensation 
sales and marketing expenses increased in as a result of the addition of sales and marketing employees acquired from crossbow 
we expect the sales and marketing expense to increase in the long term as we continue to invest in sales and marketing resources to develop new market applications  expand our sales marketing network and engage in additional marketing and promotional activities 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries and wages for administrative personnel  costs for professional services  including legal  tax and accounting services  depreciation and amortization expenses for non manufacturing equipment  travel and entertainment expenses  office supply and other office related expenses  office rental expenses  others  such as utilities  insurance and provision for accounts receivable  and stock based compensation 
our general and administrative expenses increased in due to the additional office in san jose  california  increased legal and professional fees and increased amortization expense as a result of the crossbow acquisition 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as we hire additional personnel and incur costs related to the anticipated growth of our business and our operations 
however  we expect that such expenses will decrease as a percentage of net sales 
other income expense other income expense  primarily consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents  and interest expense incurred on our borrowings and net foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
provision benefit for income taxes we conduct sales through our headquarters in andover  massachusetts 
our wuxi subsidiary is primarily engaged in manufacturing and engineering activities and does not conduct direct sales to customers 
for internal accounting and prc tax purposes  we account for the transfers of goods from our wuxi subsidiary to our us headquarters as sales  and calculate the transfer price of such sales based on a markup of manufacturing and operating costs 
we believe the prices of these sales were consistent with the prevailing market prices 
us tax in the united states  we are subject to the federal income tax and the massachusetts state income tax  which are approximately at the rates of and  respectively 
at december   the company had gross us net operating loss carryforwards of million  which expire in various amounts beginning in included within this amount is approximately  of excess tax deductions associated with non qualified stock options that have been exercised 
when these excess tax benefits actually result in a reduction to currently payable income taxes  the tax benefit will be recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital 
the company s operating losses may be subject to limitations under provisions of the internal revenue code 
prc tax our prc taxes primarily consist of enterprise income tax  value added tax  and certain other miscellaneous taxes 
enterprise income tax prc enterprise income tax is calculated based on taxable income determined under prc accounting principles 
in accordance with income tax of china for enterprises with foreign investment and foreign enterprises  or the foreign enterprise income tax law  and the related implementing rules  fies  incorporated in the prc are generally subject to an enterprise income tax rate of 
the foreign enterprise income tax law and the related implementing rules provide certain favorable tax treatments to fies which qualify as high technology companies and are registered and operate in designated high technology zones in the prc 
our wuxi subsidiary is a high technology fie registered and operating in a designated high technology zone 
accordingly  under the foreign enterprise income tax law  its implementing rules and several local regulations  our wuxi subsidiary is entitled to a preferential enterprise income tax rate of 
in addition  our wuxi subsidiary is entitled to a five year tax holiday  pursuant to which it is exempted from paying the enterprise income tax for  the year in which it first had positive accumulated earnings  and after the two year exemption period  our wuxi subsidiary is entitled to a reduction from the then applicable income tax rate for each year from through after the expiration of this five year tax holiday period  a preferential enterprise income tax rate of may apply for so long as our wuxi subsidiary continues to be recognized as a high technology company especially supported by the prc government 
to qualify as a high technology company especially supported by the prc government for prc enterprise income tax purposes  a business entity generally must meet certain financial and non financial criteria  including  but not limited to products or services of the business falling under the scope of high technology especially supported by the prc government  a minimum level of revenue generated from high technology related sales or services as a percentage of total revenue  a minimum number of employees engaged in research and development as a percentage of total number of employees  and a minimum level of research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue 
if the prc central government or applicable local governments determine that our wuxi subsidiary is not or no longer qualifies as a high technology company especially supported by the prc government  our effective enterprise income tax rate would increase as a result 
in addition  as an fie  our wuxi subsidiary memsic semiconductor enjoys certain tax deductions for purchasing equipment made in china 
under the relevant regulation  if an fie purchases chinese made equipment  and the price does not exceed the total investment amount of the fie  for projects that fall within certain specified categories  of the purchase price amount may be credited against the surplus between the amount of enterprise income tax payable in the current year and the amount paid in the previous year 
if the credited amount is greater than the surplus  the excess amount can be carried forward for up to five years  subject to certain exceptions 
if memsic semiconductor ceases to qualify for its current preferential enterprise income tax rates  we will consider options that may be available at the time that would enable it to qualify for other preferential tax treatment 
to the extent we are unable to offset the expiration of  or the inability to obtain  preferential tax treatment with new tax exemptions  tax incentives or other tax benefits  our effective tax rate will increase 
the amount of income tax payable by our wuxi subsidiary in the future will depend on various factors  including  among other things  the results of operations and taxable income of our wuxi subsidiary which is in turn partially dependent on our internal transfer pricing policies and the applicable statutory tax rate 
on march   the national people s congress approved and promulgated a new tax law named enterprise income tax law  which took effect beginning january  under the new tax law  fies and domestic companies are subject to a uniform tax rate of 
the new tax law provides a five year transition period starting from its effective date for those enterprises which were established before the promulgation date of the new tax law and which were entitled to a preferential lower tax rate under the then effective tax laws or regulations 
in accordance with regulations issued by the state council  the tax rate of such enterprises may gradually transition to the uniform tax rate within the transition period 
for those enterprises which are enjoying tax holidays  such tax holidays may continue until their expiration in accordance with the regulations issued by the state council 
while the new tax law equalizes the tax rates for fies and domestic companies  preferential tax treatment would continue to be given to companies in certain encouraged sectors and to entities classified as high technology companies especially supported by the prc government  whether fies or domestic companies 
memsic semiconductor has been qualified as a high technology company especially supported by the prc government 
therefore  a preferential enterprise income tax rate of under the new tax law may apply to our wuxi subsidiary 
however  according to the relevant transition preferential tax policies issued by the state council  the preferential enterprise income tax rate under the new tax law and the transition period preferential tax policy can not apply simultaneously 
that is to say  our wuxi subsidiary may either choose to enjoy the exemption from enterprise income tax for and and a reduction on the uniform enterprise income tax rate of from to  or  choose the preferential enterprise income tax rate of for qualified high technology companies under the new tax law 
we believe the adoption of the transition period preferential tax policy will be more beneficial to our wuxi subsidiary 
therefore  from to  the effective income tax rate for our wuxi subsidiary is 
as a result of the new tax law  following the year  upon expiration of our reduction from the then applicable income tax rate  our effective tax rate may increase  unless we are otherwise eligible for preferential treatment 
our indirect wuxi subsidiary mts is registered as a china domestic company and has not been qualified as a high technology company  therefore is currently subject to the uniform tax rate of 
at december   the net operating loss carryforward from our wuxi subsidiaries was million  which will expire in see risk factors risks related to doing business in china the discontinuation of any of the preferential tax treatments currently available to us in china could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
other prc taxes other miscellaneous prc taxes primarily consist of property tax  land use tax and stamp tax which are accounted for in our general and administrative expenses  and education surcharge  which is recorded as part of our cost of goods sold 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies are the most sensitive and are those that require the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
you should read the following descriptions of critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and other disclosures filed in with this prospectus 
investments we account for our investments under asc topic  investments debt and equity securities 
marketable securities are classified as available for sale securities and are accounted for at their fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on these securities are reported as other comprehensive income loss  respectively 
under asc topic  unrealized holding gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported net of the related tax effect in other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders equity 
when the fair value of an investment declines below its original cost  we evaluate the investment in accordance with asc topic  which address the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
when the fair value of an investment declines below its original cost  we consider all available evidence to evaluate whether the decline is other than temporary 
among other things  we consider the duration and extent of the decline and economic factors influencing the markets 
if a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the individual security is written off to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write down is reflected in earnings that is  accounted for as a realized loss 
the new cost basis is not to be changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 
subsequent increases in the fair value of available for sale securities are included in other comprehensive income  subsequent decreases in fair value  if not an other than temporary impairment  also are included in other comprehensive income 
the determination of whether a loss is other than temporary is highly judgmental and may have a material impact on our results of operations 
as of december   our investments included million of auction rate securities 
due to liquidity issues that have recently been experienced in global credit and capital markets  certain of the auction rate securities we hold have failed at auction  meaning that the amount of securities submitted for sale at auction exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
if an auction fails  the issuer becomes obligated to pay interest at penalty rates  and all of the auction rate securities we hold continue to pay interest in accordance with their stated terms 
we have classified our auction rate securities as long term investments since december   due to our assessment of the uncertainty as to the time frame within which we would likely be able to liquidate these investments under current market conditions 
we estimated the fair value of these securities at december  using broker valuations and internally developed models of the expected future cash flows related to the securities as well as a third party specialist s valuation 
one of the more significant assumptions made in our internally developed models was the term of expected cash flows of the underlying auction rate securities and the discount related to the illiquidity of the investments 
we developed several scenarios for the liquidation of the auction rate securities over periods that ranged from to years 
in estimating the fair value of these investments  we considered the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuers  the magnitude of the losses compared to the investments cost  the length of time the investments have been in an unrealized loss position  the low probability that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the security  whether the security has been downgraded by a rating agency  and our ability and intent to hold these investments until the anticipated recovery in market value occurs 
based on the estimated operating cash flows and other sources of cash  we intend to hold these auction rate securities for the foreseeable future 
our valuation analysis at december  resulted in an increase of  in temporary unrealized impairment loss 
the total unrealized impairment loss at december  was  we continue to monitor the market for auction rate securities and to assess its impact on the fair value of our investments 
if current market conditions deteriorate further  we may be required to record additional temporary unrealized losses in other comprehensive income loss or  if the decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the individual security may be written off to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write down would be reflected as a charge to earnings 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of our products to oem and odm customers when all of the following conditions have been met i evidence exists of an arrangement with the customer  typically consisting of a purchase order or contract  ii our products have been shipped and risk of loss has passed to the customer  iii we have completed all of the necessary terms of the purchase order or contract  iv the amount of revenue to which we are entitled is fixed or determinable  and v we believe it is probable that we will be able to collect the amount due from the customer 
to the extent that one or more of these conditions has not been satisfied  we defer recognition of revenue 
an allowance for estimated future product returns and sales price allowances is established at the date of revenue recognition 
an allowance for uncollectible receivables is established by a charge to operations  when in our opinion  it is probable that the amount due to us will not be collected 
historically  product returns and bad debt expense have not been significant 
our products are warranted against manufacturing defects for twelve months following the date of sale eighteen months following date of sale to a distributor 
products returned under the provisions of the warranty agreement require our pre approval 
our sole obligation under the provisions of the warranty agreement is to replace or repair the product 
reserves for potential warranty claims are provided at the time of revenue recognition and are based on several factors including historical claims experience  current sales levels and our estimate of repair costs 
to date  warranty expenses have not been significant 
we sell products to oem and odm manufacturers as well as distributors 
sales to distributors are made pursuant to distributor agreements  which allow for the return of goods under certain circumstances 
we follow the following criteria for recognition of sales to distributors i the selling price to the distributors is fixed or determinable at the date of shipment  ii our product has been shipped and risk of loss has passed to the distributors  iv it is probable that the amount due from the distributor will be collected  v we do not have a significant future obligations to directly assist in the distributor s resale of the product and vi the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
once these criteria are met  we recognize revenue upon shipment to the distributor and estimate returns based on historical sales returns 
allowance for doubtful accounts our standard policy on payment terms is net days from delivery 
in and  our average days sales outstanding was days and days  respectively 
at certain times our trade accounts receivable have included balances from customers that have exceeded of total accounts receivable 
we have established credit limits for each of our customers and reviews such limits prior to product shipment 
we believe that such customers are of high credit quality and that we are not subject to unusual risk with respect to such customers 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is included as a charge to sales and marketing expense 
we evaluate the sufficiency of our allowance for accounts receivable on a quarterly basis 
the sufficiency of our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is evaluated based on the recoverability of our accounts receivable  which is in turn based on a combination of factors  many of which are based on estimates 
these factors include indicators of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position 
in addition  we may consider the length of time the receivables are past due  the financial health of the customer and historical experience 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 
concentration of credit financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents as well as accounts receivable 
our cash and cash equivalents are on deposit at financial institutions and  at times  exceed the federal insured limits 
we believe that the financial institutions are of high credit quality and that we are not subject to unusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships 
we as indicated below had customers that comprise more than of sales or accounts receivables for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we establish credit limits for each of our customers and review such limits prior to product shipment 
we believe that our customers indicated below are of high credit quality and that we are not subject to unusual risk with respect to such customers  and generally do not require collateral 
the following schedule summarizes the percent of total sales to each customer that accounted for or more of our total sales in either of or for the year ended december  customer customer a customer e customer f customer g customer h of total sales for  one oem customer accounted for or more of our net sales

goodwill goodwill represents the excess cost of the crossbow asset acquisition over the net fair value allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and to the acquired intangible asset that does not qualify for separate recognition according to asc topic we reported goodwill of  at december  the full amount of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes 
all goodwill acquired in the crossbow acquisition has been allocated to our system solutions product segment 
the factors that account for the goodwill include the following synergies combined enhanced technical capability our low cost sensing technology combined with crossbow s system integration expertise enables us to develop low cost  high performance integrated sensing system products 
synergistic expanded customer base in stable markets the acquisition gives us access to industrial and aerospace markets that generally offer higher margins and more stability than its current mobile and consumer markets 
increased growth opportunity for the acquired business lines in the china market by utilizing our china sales channels and resources 
the opportunity to leverage our low cost manufacturing capacity in china to reduce the manufacturing cost of the acquired system products and improve gross margin 
we performed an annual impairment test for goodwill at december  and concluded that no impairment exists as of december  we valued the system solutions product segment using the income approach and the market approach 
under the income approach  we have considered the discounted cash flow dcf method 
under the market approach  we have considered the guideline public company gpc and guideline transaction gt method 
the income approach provides a method for incorporating our long term forecast into the determination of value 
judgment is required when performing adjustments to the forecast  selecting an appropriate discount rate and determining a terminal value 
the forecast of cash flows was converted to present value using a discount rate of 
we performed sensitivity analyses by testing discount rates of  and 
in the discounted cash flow analysis  terminal value was calculated by assuming a period of slowing growth followed by long term growth into perpetuity at an annual rate of 
the market approach provides a method for incorporating market prices and multiples into the determination of value 
judgment is required when selecting guideline companies and transactions and when adjusting the multiples 
under the guideline public company method  value was estimated based on multiples of revenues and projected revenues 
we compared our system solution product segment to the guideline public companies in terms of size  profit margins and revenue growth rates 
the guideline public company multiples were discounted based on these comparisons 
a premium for control of was applied to the value indicated by the guideline public company method 
under the guideline transaction method  we valued our system solutions product segment by applying an average multiple of revenues from six comparable transactions 
we have applied equal weighting to the income and market approaches 
under the market approach  we applied equal weighting to the gpc method and the gt method 
we tested the reasonableness of the fair value conclusion by calculating value using three different methods the dcf method  the gpc method and the gt method  comparing the fair value conclusion to the acquisition price and comparing the fair value of our system solutions product segment to the market capitalization of the parent company 
we plan to perform an impairment test for goodwill on an annual basis at the end of each fiscal year 
in addition to the annual goodwill impairment test  an interim test for goodwill impairment will be completed when an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
conditions that would trigger an impairment assessment  and potentially an impairment charge  include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors  the company inability to substantially meet its forecasted results over time  or business climate that could affect the value of an asset 
stock based compensation general share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options are recognized in our financial statements based on their fair values 
the cost of equity based service awards is based on the grant date fair value of the award and is recognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award vesting period 
stock based compensation arrangements with non employees are accounted for utilizing the fair value method or  if a more reliable measurement  the value of the services or consideration received 
the resulting compensation expense is recognized for financial reporting over the term of performance or vesting 
description of omnibus stock plan on march   our stockholders and board of directors approved the omnibus stock plan  as amended  or stock plan  under which  shares of our common stock was reserved for issuance to directors  officers  employees  and consultants 
options granted under the stock plan may be incentive stock options  nonqualified stock options and or restricted stock 
the stock plan provides that the exercise price of incentive stock options must be at least equal to the market value of our common stock at the date such option is granted 
for incentive stock option grants to an employee who owns more than of the outstanding shares of our common stock  the exercise price on the incentive stock option must be of market value at the time of grant 
granted options expire in ten years or less from the date of grant and vest based on the terms of the awards  generally ratably over four years 
the plan has expired and no further awards may be granted under this plan 
on august   our board of directors approved the stock incentive plan the plan  under which up to  shares of our common stock may become available for issuance 
at the adoption date   shares were reserved for issuance 
the reserved amount will increase by  shares at each of the five anniversaries of the adoption date  for a maximum of  shares issuable under the plan 
prior to december   there was no public market for our common stock 
accordingly  the board of directors determined the market value of the common stock at the date of grant by considering a number of relevant factors  including our operating and financial performance and corporate milestones achieved  the prices at which shares of convertible preferred stock in arm s length transactions were sold  the composition of and changes to the management team  the superior rights and preferences of securities senior to the common stock at the time of each grant and the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the shares of common stock underlying stock options 
on december   our board of directors approved the nonqualified inducement stock option plan the plan with an effective date on january   the closing date of the crossbow acquisition 
under the plan  up to  shares of our common stock may become available for issuance 
except as otherwise determined by the our compensation committee  the form of option to be employed under the plan shall be substantially identical to the form of nonqualified option customarily used under the stock incentive plan 
valuation of stock options we use the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the grant date fair value of an option award 
the key input assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model include  i the risk free interest rate is based on the yield available on us treasury zero coupon bonds at the date of grant with maturity dates approximately equal to the expected life at the grant date  ii the expected life of the options is based on evaluations of historical and expected future employee exercise behavior  iii volatility is based on historic volatilities from traded shares of a selected publicly traded peer group  believed to be comparable after consideration of size  maturity  profitability  growth  risk and return on investment  and iv dividend yield  we have not paid dividends in the past and it does not expect to in the foreseeable future 
we utilize historical data to estimate pre vesting forfeitures and records stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and of tax credits 
deferred tax assets arise when a company s financial statements recognize charges or expenses that  for income tax purposes  will not be allowed as deductions until future periods 
for example  when a corporation incurs an expense in its financial statements  such as restructuring charges  that it is not allowed to deduct on its federal tax return until paid in the future  the future tax benefit of that expense is generally recorded in the income statement as a reduction of income tax expense and in the balance sheet as a deferred tax asset 
the same general treatment applies to the carry forward of unused net operating losses and unused tax credits 
deferred tax assets are often netted with deferred tax liabilities when presented in the balance sheet and are referred to as net deferred tax assets 
we measure our deferred tax assets and liabilities using the tax rates and laws we expect to be in effect at the time of their reversal or utilization 
under asc topic  accounting for income tax  a net deferred tax asset may be carried on the balance sheet at its full value only if it is more likely than not that the deductions  losses  or credits giving rise to such deferred tax asset will be used in the future 
we periodically evaluate our deferred tax assets for recoverability using a consistent approach that considers the relative impact of negative and positive evidence  including our historical profitability and projections of future taxable income 
under gaap  we are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income or stockholders equity if we determine  based on available evidence at the time the determination is made  that it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we estimate future taxable income based on management approved business plans and ongoing tax planning strategies 
this process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between our projected operating performance  our actual results and other factors 
we have been in a three year cumulative loss position since in the united states and as a result we recorded a full valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets  due to the uncertainty with respect to future taxable income in the united states 
in the event we generate future taxable income our income tax expense in future periods could be reduced to the extent those deferred tax assets are deemed recoverable 
the deferred tax asset balance at december  was  including  related to prc taxes applicable to our china subsidiary   related to japan taxes applicable to crossbow japan and  related to us tax applicable to unremitted minority earnings 
we reinvest any earnings of our wuxi subsidiary  memsic semiconductor  in its operations 
we have not provided for us income taxes that could result from the distribution of such earnings to us 
if these earnings were ultimately distributed to the us in the form of dividends or otherwise  or if the shares of the wuxi subsidiary were sold or transferred  we would be subject to additional us income taxes  net of impact of any available foreign tax credits 
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognized deferred us taxes on these undistributed earnings 
we have performed an analysis of our uncertain tax positions in connection with the application of asc topic as of the year ended december  and concluded we have no uncertain tax positions that do not meet a more likely than not standard set forth by asc topic therefore  we have recorded no tax reserve related to uncertain positions in our financial statements advance research funding advance research funding represents grants awarded by the chinese government to fund specific research and development projects that we undertake 
the amount received is initially recorded as a liability and subsequently recognized as a credit to research and development expenses in our statements of operations as we perform the project and comply with the conditions or performance obligations attached to the related government grants 
significant judgment may be involved in assessing our completion of the project or compliance with relevant performance obligations 
results of operations the following tables set forth a summary of our consolidated statements of operations for the periods by amount and as a percentage of our total net sales 
this information should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the operating results in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period for the year ended december  amount of net sales amount of net sales dollar amounts in thousands net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization total operating expenses operating loss other income interest and dividend income foreign exchange gain loss other  net total other income earnings loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income less net income attributable to noncontrolling interest net income loss attributable to memsic  inc year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
our net sales increased by to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to incremental sales from our crossbow acquisition and an increase in sales from automotive applications  partially offset by a decrease in sales from mobile phone and consumer applications 
sales in our systems solutions segment contributed million in incremental sales in sales in mobile phone applications decreased to million in from million in  due to significant price erosion in the market and a decline in unit sales due to competition from lower priced sensors 
specifically  the china mobile phone market has been under increasing price pressure primarily due to competition from vendors of mechanical switch and ball sensor products 
sales in automotive applications increased to million in from million in the increase reflects the continued growth of sensor products in the vehicle stability control market 
sales in consumer applications decreased to million in  compared to million in net sales in the decrease was largely attributable to the price decline of accelerometer products in the consumer market and the volatility of this market 
cost of goods sold 
our cost of goods sold increased by to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to the incremental sales from crossbow acquisition as well as the increase in the volume of units of our sensor products sold 
gross profit and gross margin 
our gross profit increased by to million in from million in our gross margin decreased to in from in primarily due to the continuing decline in the average selling prices of our products in  particularly on products for mobile phone applications  which more than offset the generally higher gross margins on our new system solution products 
our gross profits and gross margins by product type are shown in the following table dollars in thousands for the year ended december  gross profit margin gross profit margin sensor products system solution products total our gross profit and gross margin from our sensor products was million and for  compared to million and in the decrease was primarily due to the price reduction of our sensor products for the mobile phone applications in china market 
the gross profit and gross margin from our system solution products was million and and had a positive impact on the overall gross margin for our gross margin from our system solution products was in the fourth quarter of and we expect our gross margin on system solution products will continue to improve in as we complete the transition of manufacturing of these products to china 
research and development 
our research and development expenses increased by  to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to the addition of an engineering team and related expense as a result of the crossbow acquisition as well as an increase in the research and material costs related to developing new products and system solutions 
research and development expenses  as a percentage of total net sales  increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  we will continue to invest in research and development projects to develop new products and system solutions  and as a result  we expect our research and development expense will continue to increase in sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses increased by to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to the addition of a sales and marketing team in california as a result of the crossbow acquisition and an increase in headcount of the sales and marketing resources for our existing product lines 
sales and marketing expenses  as a percentage of total net sales  increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses increased by to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to the addition of a california office  related office expense and insurance expense which more than offset lower professional fees associated with the crossbow acquisition in compared to general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of total net sales  increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  amortization 
amortization expense increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to the amortization of intangible assets related to the crossbow acquisition 
other income 
our other income was million in compared to million in this increase was primarily due to foreign exchange gain partially offset by lower interest income as a result of lower interest rates 
provision for income taxes 
our income tax benefit was  in compared to an income tax provision of  in our income tax benefit in reflected principally a provision of  related to net income in our joint venture crossbow japan and a provision of  related to certain deferred tax liabilities  which were more than offset by an income tax benefit of  related to a research and development tax credit received by our wuxi subsidiary 
our income tax provision for principally reflected income tax expense incurred by our wuxi subsidiary 
beginning in  our wuxi subsidiary started its three year tax holiday period at one half the unified tax rate of  which will extend until liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of million 
in addition  our investments included million of auction rate securities that have failed at auction and that are classified as long term investments on our balance sheet 
the principal represented by these investments will not be accessible to us until one of the following occurs a successful auction occurs  the issuer redeems the issue  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the underlying securities have matured 
based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not expect the potential lack of liquidity in these investments to affect our ability to execute our current business plan in the near term 
there can be no assurance that we would be able in the near term to liquidate these securities on favorable terms  or at all  and if we should require access to these funds sooner than we currently expect  our inability to sell these auction rate securities could adversely affect our liquidity and our financial flexibility 
we outsource certain steps of the manufacturing process to third parties while conducting the remaining steps in house 
as a result  our principal uses of cash historically have consisted of payments to our suppliers for the costs related to the outsourcing of wafer fabrication and outsourced processing fees paid to and materials purchased from third parties  as well as payments for our manufacturing overhead and equipment purchases 
other significant cash outlays consist of capital expenditures  including the construction of our buildings in china 
we also have used cash to fund salaries  wages and commissions for our non manufacturing related employees 
on june   our newly established indirect wuxi subsidiary  mts  obtained a million  five year project loan from agricultural bank of china 
of this amount  million was used by mts to purchase from us substantially all the assets that we purchased from crossbow technology  inc  million is for working capital purposes and million remains for the purchase of equipment to build the manufacturing capacity for the system solution products 
this loan is collateralized by the buildings and land owned by our wuxi subsidiaries as well as the intellectual property purchased by mts from us 
the interest rate of the loan is a variable rate  adjusted semi annually based on the libor rate plus 
mts has obtained agreement from the local wuxi government to fully subsidize the interest expense on a quarterly basis 
as of december    has been withdrawn and is outstanding 
in june  we purchased a parcel of land in wuxi for million  to be used for the construction of a new manufacturing facility for mts 
we believe that our current cash and recent proceeds of our project loan from the agricultural bank of china will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs  including working capital requirements and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
our future cash requirements will depend on many factors  including our operating income  the timing of our new product introductions  the costs to maintaining adequate manufacturing capacity  the continuing market acceptance of our products  or other changing business conditions and future developments  including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue 
if our existing cash is insufficient to meet our requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity securities  debt securities or borrow from banks 
we cannot assure you that financing will be available in the amounts we need or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
the sale of additional equity securities  including convertible debt securities  would be dilutive to our stockholders 
the incurrence of indebtedness would divert cash for working capital requirements and capital expenditures to service debt and could result in operating and financial covenants that restrict our operations and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders 
if we are unable to obtain additional equity or debt financing  our business  operations and prospects may suffer

capital expenditures we have completed the first phase of construction of two new buildings adjacent to our current facility in wuxi  china  comprising  square meters  consisting of  square meters for a new research and development institute  and  square meters of new manufacturing facilities 
phase one included the structural construction of the two new buildings and furnishing and fitting out the research and development office building 
we started using the research and development office building in the fourth quarter of the total cost for this phase was million 
phase two includes the furnishing and equipment of the manufacturing facility 
at the beginning of  we started phase two to furnish and equip a portion of our new manufacturing facility to meet our expected production requirements for both accelerometer products and non accelerometer products in as of december   we had spent approximately million for this phase 
our capital expenditures amounted to million and million in and  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have special purpose entities 
other than operating leases for office leases we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu no 
addresses the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit 
this guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which is based on a vendor specific objective evidence  b third party evidence  or c estimates 
this guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
in addition  this guidance significantly expands required disclosures related to a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu no 
is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  and early adoption is permitted 
a company may elect  but will not be required  to adopt the amendments in asu no 
retrospectively for all prior periods 
we do not expect the adoption of asu to have a material impact on our financial position or statement of operations 
in december  the fasb issued asc topic  business combinations 
the purpose of this statement is to improve the relevance  representational faithfulness  and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects 
this statement is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  the adoption of the provisions of this statement did not have any impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we followed this provision for our accounting for the crossbow acquisition
