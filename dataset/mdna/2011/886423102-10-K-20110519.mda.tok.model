item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report for a greater discussion of the company s international and us segments  including the macroeconomic environment and market direction for each segment 
in addition  please refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for segment  geographical data and major customer information 
the past and potential future impact of the deepwater horizon disaster on our business as an international energy service company that derives over of its revenues from operations outside of united states territorial waters  we believe that the overall impact of the deepwater horizon incident will not have a significant immediate impact on our overall operations or financial performance 
less than of our total fleet operates in the us gom  and  if necessary  these vessels can be mobilized to serve other markets if demand for their services does not continue to exist in the us gom because of any precipitous and long term reduction in the level of drilling and exploration activity in that region 
on october   the us government lifted the previously imposed moratorium suspending all deepwater drilling and exploration activity 
new regulations of the boemre calling for additional safety measures and inspections have caused significant disruption and delays in the permit process and are creating uncertainty as to when drilling activity will recommence to pre moratorium levels 
one of the consequences of the new regulatory environment may be that future deepwater exploration activity domestically will be limited to very large oil companies  which may limit the number of customers for the company s services in supporting deepwater exploration 
although exploration activity in the shallow waters of the us gom was allowed to re commence prior to october   and the boemre began issuing permits for deepwater exploration and drilling in the latter part of february  but only a limited number of new drilling permits have been issued since the spill 
it appears the re commencement of new drilling activities in the gulf of mexico will be a slow process 
over the longer term  we  like others that operate in the us gom  are concerned that new safety standards and other regulatory responses to the rig explosion and oil spill will result in higher operating costs and reduced 
table of contents 
index to financial statements exploration and field development and particularly deepwater exploration and field development 
we do not know when  or if  drilling activities will return to the levels seen prior to the deepwater horizon disaster 
in an effort to promote offshore drilling  a number of bills were introduced in the us house of representatives in late march  that aim to increase offshore drilling by requiring the us department of the interior to act on drilling application permits within days of receipt  to conduct the postponed crude oil and natural gas lease sales in the us gom and offshore virginia  and also to auction a majority of the crude oil and natural gas leases that contain the most known reserves 
it is too early in the legislative process to determine if any or all of these bills will be passed or signed into law 
if exploration and production activity continues to migrate from the us gom to international markets because of the additional regulations and higher operating costs in the us gom  it is also probable that other offshore supply vessel owners will redeploy additional vessels to international markets 
this could increase competition and have a negative effect on vessel utilization and day rates in international markets  depending on the number of drilling rigs and offshore supply vessels that exit the us gom and move to international markets 
geographic areas of operation the company s fleet is deployed in the major global offshore oil and gas areas of the world 
the principal areas of the company s operations include the us gom  the persian arabian gulf  and areas offshore australia  brazil  egypt  india  indonesia  malaysia  mexico  trinidad  and west and east africa 
the company regularly evaluates the deployment of its assets and repositions its vessels based on customer demand  relative market conditions  and other considerations

index to financial statements our global vessel fleet the company continues an aggressive but disciplined vessel construction  acquisition and replacement program that was initiated with the intent of assuring the company s presence in nearly all major oil and gas producing regions of the world through the replacement of aging vessels in the company s fleet with fewer  larger  and more technologically sophisticated vessels 
since calendar  the company purchased and or constructed vessels for approximately billion 
to date  the company has generally funded its vessel programs from its operating cash flow and funds provided by the private placements of million in senior unsecured notes  borrowings under revolving credit facilities  and various sales leaseback arrangements 
the company s strategy contemplates organic growth through the construction of vessels at a variety of shipyards worldwide and possible acquisitions of recently built vessels and or other owners and operators having attractive offshore supply vessels or fleets 
the company has the largest number of new vessels among its competitors in the industry  but it also has the largest number of older vessels for which management regularly evaluates disposition and other alternatives 
the company intends to pursue its long term fleet replenishment and modernization strategy on a disciplined basis and  in each case  will carefully consider whether proposed investments and transactions have the appropriate risk reward profile 
the average age of the company s owned or chartered vessel fleet including stacked vessels but excluding joint venture vessels and vessels withdrawn from service at march  is approximately years 
the average age of the vessels that the company acquired or constructed since calendar year as part of its new build and acquisition program and which accounted for approximately of vessel revenue in fiscal is approximately years 
the remaining vessels have an average age of years 
of the company s vessels  are deepwater class vessels  are in the towing supply supply class vessels  are crew utility class vessels and are offshore tugs 
at march   the company had agreements to acquire eight vessels and commitments to build vessels at a number of different shipyards around the world with one of these vessels being constructed in the united states by the company s wholly owned shipyard  quality shipyards  llc at a total cost  including contract costs and other incidental costs  of approximately million 
of the new build vessels  eight are anchor handling towing supply vessels ranging between  and  brake horsepower bhp  are platform supply vessels ranging between  and  deadweight tons of cargo capacity  and one is a fast crew supply boat 
scheduled delivery for these vessels began in april  with delivery of the final vessel expected in april of the eight vessels to be purchased  seven are anchor handling towing supply vessels and one is a platform supply vessel 
the aggregate approximate purchase price for these eight vessels is million 
the company expects to take possession of six of the seven anchor handling towing supply vessels throughout calendar year and the final anchor handling towing supply vessel in february for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the company took possession of the platform supply vessel in april for an approximate purchase price of million 
at march   the company had expended million for the acquisition of these eight vessels 
at march   the company had invested million in progress payments towards the construction of vessels and million towards the purchase of the eight vessels 
at march   the remaining expenditures necessary to complete construction of the vessels currently under construction based on contract prices  and to fund the acquisition of the eight vessels was million 
a full discussion of the company s capital commitments  scheduled delivery dates and vessel sales is disclosed in the vessel count  dispositions  acquisitions and construction programs section of item and note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
the vessel count  dispositions  acquisitions and construction programs section of item also contains a table comparing the actual march  vessel count and the average number of vessels by class and geographic distribution during the three years ended march   and between april and march  the company also sold  primarily to buyers that operate outside of our industry  vessels 
most of the vessel sales were at prices that exceeded their carrying values 
in aggregate

our vessel classifications the company s vessels regularly and routinely move from one operating area to another  often to and from offshore operating areas of different continents 
the company discloses its vessel statistical information  such as revenue  utilization and average day rates  by vessel class 
listed below are the company s five major vessel classes along with a description of the type of vessels categorized in each class and the services the respective vessels typically perform 
tables comparing the average size of the company s marine fleet by class and geographic distribution for the last three fiscal years are included in item of this report 
deepwater vessels included in this vessel class are large typically greater than feet and or with at least  tons in dead weight cargo carrying capacity  platform supply vessels psvs and large  higher horsepower generally greater than  horsepower anchor handling towing supply ahts vessels 
this vessel class is generally chartered to customers for use in transporting supplies and equipment from shore bases to deepwater and intermediate water depth offshore drilling rigs  platforms and other installations 
platform supply vessels  which have large cargo capacities  serve drilling and production facilities and support offshore construction and maintenance work 
the anchor handling towing supply vessels are equipped to tow drilling rigs and other marine equipment  as well as to set anchors for the positioning and mooring of drilling rigs 
also included in this vessel class are specialty vessels that can support offshore well stimulation  construction work  subsea services and or have fire fighting capabilities and or accommodation facilities 
these vessels are generally available for routine supply and towing services but are outfitted and primarily intended for specialty services 
included in the specialty vessel category is the company s one multi purpose platform supply vessel mpsv  which is designed for subsea service and construction support activities 
towing supply and supply vessels this is the company s largest fleet class by number of vessels 
included in this class are anchor handling towing supply vessels and supply vessels with horsepower below  bhp  and platform supply vessels that are generally less than feet 
the vessels in this class perform the same functions and services as their deepwater vessel class counterparts except they are generally chartered to customers for use in intermediate and shallow waters 
crewboats and utility vessels crewboats and utility vessels are chartered to customers for use in transporting personnel and supplies from shore bases to offshore drilling rigs  platforms and other installations 
these vessels are also often equipped for oil field security missions in markets where piracy  kidnapping or other potential violence presents a concern 
offshore tugs offshore tugs tow floating drilling rigs  assist in the docking of tankers  tow barges  assist pipe laying  cable laying and construction barges  and are used in a variety of other commercial towing operations  including towing barges carrying a variety of bulk cargoes and containerized cargo 
other vessels until the first quarter of fiscal  the company s other vessels included inshore tugs and production  line handling and various other special purpose vessels 
inshore tugs  which are operated principally within inland waters  tow drilling rigs to and from their locations and tow barges carrying equipment and materials for use principally in inland waters for drilling and production operations 
barges are either used in conjunction with company tugs or are chartered to others 
the company sold its remaining other type vessels during the first quarter of fiscal

index to financial statements revenue contribution of main classes of vessels revenues from vessel operations were derived from the main classes of vessels in the following percentages year ended march  deepwater vessels towing supply supply crew utility offshore tugs other shipyard operations quality shipyards  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  operates two shipyards in houma  louisiana  that construct  modernize and repair vessels 
the shipyards perform repair work and new construction work for third party customers  as well as the construction  repair and modification of the company s own vessels 
during the last three fiscal years  quality shipyards  llc constructed and delivered two foot platform supply vessels and is currently constructing one additional foot platform supply vessel for the company 
the two foot platform supply vessels were delivered during fiscal the foot deepwater  platform supply vessel that is currently under construction is expected to be delivered in november customers and contracts the company s operations are materially dependent upon the levels of activity in offshore crude oil and natural gas exploration  field development and production throughout the world  which is affected by trends in worldwide crude oil and natural gas prices including expectations of future commodity pricing that are ultimately influenced by the supply and demand relationship for these natural resources 
the activity levels of our customers are also influenced by the cost of exploring and producing crude oil and natural gas  which can be affected by environmental regulations  technological advances that affect energy production and consumption  significant weather conditions  the ability of our customers to raise capital  and local and international economic and political environments  including government mandated moratoriums 
a discussion of current market conditions and trends appears under macroeconomic environment and outlook in item of this report 
the company s principal customers are major and independent oil and natural gas exploration  field development and production companies  foreign government owned or controlled organizations and companies that explore and produce oil and natural gas  drilling contractors  and companies that provide other services to the offshore energy industry  including but not limited to  offshore construction companies  diving companies and well stimulation companies 
in recent years  consolidation of exploration  field development  and production companies has occurred and this trend may continue in the future 
consolidation reduces the number of customers for the company s equipment  and may negatively affect exploration  field development and production activity as consolidated companies generally focus on increasing efficiency and reducing costs and delay or abandon exploration activity with less promise 
such activity could adversely affect demand for the company s vessels  and reduce the company s revenues 
the company s primary source of revenue is derived from time charter contracts of its vessels on a rate per day of service basis  therefore  vessel revenues are recognized on a daily basis throughout the contract period 
as noted above  these time charter contracts are generally either on a term or spot basis 
there are no material differences in the cost structure of the company s contracts based on whether the contracts are spot or term because the operating costs are generally the same without regard to the length of a contract 
for the year ended march   chevron corporation including its worldwide subsidiaries and affiliates accounted for approximately and petroleo brasileiro sa accounted for approximately of total revenues 
the unexpected loss of either or both of these two significant customers could  at least in the short term  have a material adverse effect on the company s vessel utilization and its results of operations

competition the principal competitive factors for the offshore vessel service industry are the suitability and availability of vessel equipment  price and quality of service 
in addition  the ability to demonstrate a strong safety record and attract and retain qualified and skilled personnel are also important competitive factors 
the company has numerous competitors in all areas in which it operates around the world  and the business environment in all of these markets is highly competitive 
the company s diverse  mobile asset base and the wide geographic distribution of its assets generally enable the company to respond relatively quickly to changes in market conditions and to provide a broad range of vessel services to its customers around the world 
the company s management believes the company has a competitive advantage because of the size  diversity and geographic distribution of its vessel fleet 
economies of scale and experience level in the many areas of the world in which we operate are also considered competitive advantages as is the company s strong financial position 
according to ods petrodata  the global offshore supply vessel market has approximately new build offshore support vessels platform supply vessels and anchor handlers only at march  that are currently estimated to be under construction and that are expected to be delivered to the worldwide offshore vessel market primarily over the next three and a half years 
the current worldwide fleet of these classes of vessels is estimated at approximately  vessels  of which we estimate in excess of are stacked 
an increase in worldwide vessel capacity could have the effect of lowering charter rates  particularly when there are lower levels of exploration  field development and production activity 
the worldwide offshore marine vessel industry  however  also has a large number of aging vessels  including more than vessels  or approximately of the worldwide offshore fleet  that are at least years old  that are nearing or exceeding original expectations of their estimated economic lives 
these older vessels could potentially be removed from the market within the next few years if the cost of extending the vessels lives is not economically justifiable 
although the future attrition rate of these aging vessels cannot be accurately predicted  the company believes that the retirement of a sizeable portion of these aging vessels would likely mitigate the potential combined negative effects of new build vessels on vessel utilization and vessel pricing 
additional vessel demand could also be created with the addition of new drilling rigs and floating production units that are expected to be delivered and become operational over the next few years  which should help minimize the possible negative effects of the new build offshore support vessels being added to the offshore support vessel fleet 
it is unknown at this time the extent to which the recovery from the recent global recession will influence the utilization of equipment currently in existence or the ultimate timing of delivery and placing into service of new drilling rigs  floating production units and vessels currently under construction 
challenges we confront as an international offshore vessel company the company operates in many challenging operating environments around the world that present varying degrees of political  social  economic and other uncertainties 
we operate in markets where there are risks of expropriation  confiscation or nationalization of our vessels or other assets  terrorism  piracy  civil unrest  changing foreign currency exchange rates and controls  and changing political conditions  any of which may adversely affect our operations 
although the company takes what it believes to be prudent measures to safeguard its property  personnel and financial condition against these risks  it cannot mitigate entirely the foregoing risks  although the wide geographic dispersion of the company s vessels helps reduce the likely overall potential impact of these risks 
in addition  immigration  customs  tax and other regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof can have a material impact on our ability to work in certain countries and on our operating costs 
in some international operating environments  local customs or laws may require the company to form joint ventures with local owners or use local agents 
the company is dedicated to carrying out its international operations in compliance with the rules and regulations of the office of foreign assets control ofac  the trading with the enemy act  the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa  and other applicable laws and regulations 
the company has adopted policies and procedures to mitigate the risks of violating these rules and regulations

index to financial statements sonatide tidewater has a ownership interest in sonatide  a joint venture that owns vessels that serve the angolan offshore energy industry 
tidewater has previously disclosed that it has been in discussions with its joint venture partner  sonangol  with respect to certain terms and conditions of the joint venture agreement under which sonatide is managed and operated 
this joint venture agreement was originally scheduled to expire by its terms on july   however  representatives of sonangol and tidewater have  from time to time  agreed to extend the expiration date of the joint venture agreement 
the most recent extension extends the expiration date to july  the purpose of these extensions is to give the parties additional time to negotiate the terms of a new  more permanent joint venture agreement 
successfully concluding a new joint venture agreement in a timely manner is a priority for the company 
no assurances can be given  however  that these discussions will be successfully concluded or whether such terms will be advantageous to the company 
failing to further extend the existing sonatide joint venture or reach a new joint venture agreement with sonangol could impair the company s ability to continue to effectively compete for business in angola in the future 
more tidewater vessels are deployed in angola and more revenue is derived from our operations in angola than in or from any of tidewater s other countries of operation 
sonangol and tidewater have agreed to continue the sonatide joint venture to the extent required to fulfill several new or renewed charterparty agreements with customers in angola that extend well beyond july  these charterparty agreements cover a substantial portion of our vessels in angola 
accordingly  while no assurances can be given that negotiations of a new  more permanent joint venture agreement will be successfully concluded  the joint venture has been extended  on a charter by charter basis  to fulfill the remaining term of existing charters for the vessels owned by the joint venture and the tidewater owned vessels operating in angola 
over the course of the last few months  a number of new or renewed charters have been entered into on this basis 
international labour organization s maritime labour convention the international labour organization s maritime labour convention  the convention seeks to mandate globally  among other things  seafarer working conditions  ship accommodations  wages  conditions of employment  health and other benefits for all ships and the seafarers on those ships that are engaged in commercial activities 
to date  this convention has been ratified by countries  namely  the bahamas  bosnia and herzegovina  bulgaria  canada  croatia  liberia  marshall islands  norway  panama  st 
vincent and the grenadines  spain and switzerland representing in excess of of the world s vessel tonnage 
if adopted by an additional countries  then within months thereof  the convention will become law 
in the unlikely event that ratification were to be achieved in  the convention would become law in or  depending upon the date of final ratification 
even though the company believes that the labor changes proposed by this convention are unnecessary in light of existing international labor laws that govern many of these issues  and the company continues to work with industry representatives to oppose ratification of this convention  the company will continue to review and assess its seafarer labor relationships in light of the convention requirements 
should this convention become law  the company and its customers operations may be negatively affected by future compliance costs 
government regulation the company is subject to various united states federal  state and local statutes and regulations governing the operation and maintenance of its vessels 
the company s us flag vessels are subject to the jurisdiction of the united states coast guard  the united states customs and border protection  and the united states maritime administration 
the company is also subject to international laws and conventions and the laws of international jurisdictions where the company and its offshore vessels operate

the company has a dual stock certificate system to protect against non us citizens owning more than of its common stock 
in addition  the company s charter provides the company with certain remedies with respect to any transfer or purported transfer of shares of the company s common stock that would result in the ownership by non us citizens of more than of its common stock 
based on information supplied to the company by its transfer agent  approximately of the company s outstanding common stock was owned by non us citizens as of march  the laws of the us require that vessels engaged in the us coastwise trade must be built in the us in addition  once a us built vessel is registered under a non us flag  it cannot thereafter engage in us coastwise trade 
therefore  the company s us flag vessels must operate outside of the us coastwise trade 
of the total vessels owned or operated by the company at march   vessels were registered under flags other than the united states and vessels were registered under the us flag 
if the company is not able to secure adequate numbers of charters abroad for its non us flag vessels  even if work would otherwise have been available for such vessels in the united states  these vessels cannot operate in the us coastwise trade  and the company s financial performance could be affected 
all of the company s offshore vessels are subject to either united states or international safety and classification standards or sometimes both

vessels registered under flags other than the united states are subject to similar regulations and are governed by the laws of the applicable international jurisdictions and the rules and requirements of various classification societies  such as the american bureau of shipping 
the company is in compliance with the international ship and port facility security code isps  an amendment to the safety of life at sea solas convention  and further mandated in the maritime transportation and security act of to align united states regulations with those of solas and the isps code 
under the isps code  the company performs worldwide security assessments  risk analyses  and develops vessel and required port facility security plans to enhance safe and secure vessel and facility operations 
additionally  the company has developed security annexes for those us flag vessels that transit or work in waters designated as high risk by the united states coast guard pursuant to marsec directive  revision five 
environmental compliance during the ordinary course of business  the company s operations are subject to a wide variety of environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of oil and pollutants into navigable waters 
violations of these laws may result in civil and criminal penalties  fines  injunction and other sanctions 
compliance with the existing governmental regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has not had  nor is expected to have  a material effect on the company 
environmental laws and regulations are subject to change however  and may impose increasingly strict requirements and  as such  the company cannot estimate the ultimate cost of complying with such potential changes to environmental laws and regulations 
all vessels over feet in registered length  regardless of flag  that are operating as a means of transportation within the inland and offshore waters of the us but not beyond the three nautical mile territorial sea limit must comply with the environmental protection agency s national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes vessel general permit vgp for discharges incidental to the normal operation of vessels

whenever possible  hazardous materials are maintained or transferred in confined areas in an attempt to ensure containment if accidents occur 
in addition  the company has established operating policies that are intended to increase awareness of actions that may harm the environment 
safety the company is committed to ensuring the safety of its operations for both its employees and its customers 
the company s principal operations occur in offshore waters where the workplace environment presents safety challenges 
because the work environment presents these challenges  the company must work diligently to maintain workplace safety 
management regularly communicates with its personnel to promote safety and instill safe work habits through company media and safety review sessions 
the company also regularly conducts safety training meetings for its seamen and shore based staff personnel 
the company dedicates personnel and resources to ensure safe operations and regulatory compliance 
the company s director of health  safety and environmental management is involved in proactive efforts to prevent accidents and injuries and reviews all incidents that occur throughout the company 
in addition  the company employs safety personnel at every operating location who are responsible for administering the company s safety programs and fostering the company s safety culture 
the company believes that every employee is a safety supervisor  and gives each employee the right  the responsibility  and the obligation to stop any operation that the employee deems to be unsafe  whether it is deemed to be  in retrospect  unsafe or not 
risk management the operation of any marine vessel involves an inherent risk of catastrophic marine disaster  adverse sea and weather conditions  mechanical failure  collisions and property losses to the vessel 
in addition  the nature of our operations exposes the company to the potential risks of damage to and loss of drilling rigs and production facilities  war  sabotage  pirate and terrorism risks  and business interruption due to political action or inaction  including nationalization of assets by foreign governments 
any such event may result in a reduction in revenues or increased costs 
the company s vessels are generally insured for their estimated market value against damage or loss  including war  terrorism acts  and pollution risks  but the company does not fully insure for business interruption 
the company also carries workers compensation  maritime employer s liability  director and officer liability  general liability including third party pollution and other insurance customary in the industry 
the company seeks to secure appropriate insurance coverage at competitive rates by maintaining a self retention layer up to certain limits on its marine package policies 
the company carefully monitors claims and participates actively in claims estimates and adjustments 
estimated costs of self insured claims  which include estimates for incurred but unreported claims  are accrued as liabilities on our balance sheet 
the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility have significantly increased the risk of political  economic and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which the company operates 
it is possible that further acts of terrorism may be directed against the united states domestically or abroad  and such acts of terrorism could be directed against properties and personnel of us owned companies such as ours 
the resulting economic  political and social uncertainties  including the potential for future terrorist acts and war  could cause the premiums charged for our insurance coverage to increase 
the company currently maintains war risk coverage on its entire fleet 
management believes that the company s insurance coverage is adequate 
the company has not experienced a loss in excess of insurance policy limits  however  there is no assurance that the company s liability coverage will be adequate to cover all potential claims that may arise 
while the company believes that it should be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates considered commercially acceptable  it cannot guarantee such with the current level of uncertainty in the markets the company operates 
raw materials the company s wholly owned subsidiary  quality shipyards  llc  performs both repair work and new construction work for outside customers  as well as the construction  repair and modification of the company s own vessels 
the shipyard operations require raw materials  such as alloy steels in various forms  welding

the shipyard does not depend on any one supplier or source for any of these materials 
although shortages for some of these materials and fuels have occurred from time to time  no material shortage currently exists nor does the shipyard anticipate any shortages 
the commodity price for iron ore  the main component of steel  is typically volatile  and shortages may occur from time to time 
seasonality the company s global vessel fleet generally has its highest utilization rates in the warmer months when the weather is more favorable for offshore exploration  field development and construction work 
the company s us gom operations can be impacted by the atlantic hurricane season from the months of june through november  when offshore exploration  field development and construction work tends to slow or halt in an effort to mitigate potential losses and damage that may occur to the offshore oil and gas infrastructure should a hurricane enter the us gom 
however  demand for offshore marine vessels typically increases in the us gom in connection with repair and remediation work that follows any hurricane damage to offshore crude oil and natural gas infrastructure 
the company s vessels that operate in southeast asia and pacific are impacted by the monsoon season  which moves across the region between september and early march 
the company s business volume is more dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices and global supply and demand conditions for the company s offshore marine services than any seasonal variation 
employees as of march   the company had approximately  employees worldwide 
the company strives to maintain excellent relations with its employees 
the company is not a party to any union contract in the united states but through several subsidiaries is a party to union agreements covering local nationals in several countries other than the united states 
in the past  the company has been the subject of a union organizing campaign for the us gom employees by maritime labor unions 
these union organizing efforts have abated  although the threat has not been completely eliminated 
if the employees in the us gom were to unionize  the company s flexibility in managing industry changes in the domestic market could be adversely affected

risk factors the company operates globally in many challenging and highly competitive markets 
listed below are some of the more critical or unique risk factors that we have identified as affecting or potentially affecting the company and the offshore marine service industry 
you should consider these risks when evaluating any of the company s forward looking statements

oil and gas prices are highly volatile commodity prices for crude oil and natural gas are highly volatile 
prices are extremely sensitive to the respective supply demand relationship for crude oil and natural gas 
high demand for crude oil and natural gas  reductions in supplies and or low inventory levels for these resources as well as any perceptions about future supply interruptions can cause prices for crude oil and natural gas to rise 
conversely  low demand for crude oil and natural gas  increases in supplies and or increases in crude oil and natural gas inventories cause prices for crude oil and natural gas to decrease 
in addition  global military  political  and economic events  including civil unrest in the middle east and north africa oil producing and exporting countries  have contributed to crude oil and natural gas price volatility 
factors that affect the supply of crude oil and natural gas include  but are not limited to  the following global demand for the hydrocarbons  the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec ability to control crude oil production levels and pricing  as well as  the level of production by non opec countries  political and economic uncertainties including wars  terrorist acts or security operations  advances in exploration and field development technologies  significant weather conditions  and governmental policies restrictions placed on exploration and production of natural resources 
prolonged material downturns in crude oil and natural gas prices and or perceptions of long term lower commodity prices can negatively impact the development plans of exploration and production companies given the long term nature of large scale development projects 
in addition  a prolonged recession may result in a decrease in demand for offshore support vessel services and a reduction in charter rates and or utilization rates  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
higher commodity prices  however  do not necessarily translate into increased demand for offshore support vessel services as increased commodity supply could come from land based energy markets 
crude oil pricing volatility has increased in recent years as crude oil has emerged into a financial asset class used for speculative purchase 
traditionally  crude oil futures and options were purchased by the commercial traders for future production in an effort to hedge against price risk 
more recently  non commercial market participants have traded crude oil derivatives to profit off of the price performance of crude oil instead of traditional investments 
the extent to which speculation causes excessive crude oil pricing volatility is currently not fully known  however  there is a growing consensus that speculative purchase of crude oil futures and options helped push crude oil prices to record levels in mid the escalation in energy prices and subsequent financial crisis and global economic recession helped to create a global accord to limit or prevent excessive speculation in an effort to diminish extreme crude oil price volatility 
changes in the level of capital spending by our customers our principal customers are major and independent oil and natural gas exploration  field development and production companies  foreign government owned or controlled organizations and companies that explore and produce oil and natural gas  drilling contractors  and companies that provide other services to the offshore energy industry  such as  offshore construction companies  diving companies and well stimulation companies 
our results of operations are highly dependent on the level of capital spending for exploration and field development by the companies that operate in the energy industry 
the energy industry s level of capital spending is substantially related to current and expected future demand for hydrocarbons and the prevailing commodity prices of crude oil and  to a lesser extent  natural gas 
when commodity prices are low  our customers generally reduce their capital spending budgets for onshore and offshore drilling  exploration and field development 
the level of offshore crude oil and natural gas exploration  development and production activity has historically been volatile  and that volatility is likely to continue 

table of contents 
index to financial statements other factors that influence the level of capital spending by our customers that are beyond our control include worldwide demand for crude oil and natural gas  the cost of exploring and producing crude oil and natural gas  which can be affected by environmental regulations  significant weather conditions  technological advances that affect energy production and consumption  local and international economic and political environment  and the availability and cost of financing 
the offshore marine service industry is highly competitive the company operates in a highly competitive industry  which could depress vessel charter rates and utilization and adversely affect the company s financial performance 
we compete for business with our competitors on the basis of price  reputation for quality service  quality  suitability and technical capabilities of vessels  availability of vessels  safety and efficiency  cost of mobilizing vessels from one market to a different market  and national flag preference 
in addition  competition in international markets may be adversely affected by regulations requiring  among other things  the awarding of contracts to local contractors  the employment of local citizens and or the purchase of supplies from local vendors that favor or require local ownership 
in general  declines in the level of offshore drilling and development activity by the energy industry negatively affects the demand for our vessels and results in downward pressure on day rates 
extended periods of low vessel demand and or low day rates reduce the company s revenues 
risk associated with the loss of a major customer we derive a significant amount of revenue from a few customers 
for the years ended march   and  the five largest customers accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s total revenues  while the largest customers accounted for a respective  and of our total revenues 
our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if one or more of these customers decide to interrupt or curtail their activities  terminate their contracts with us  fail to renew existing contracts  and or refuse to award new contracts  and we were unable to contract our vessels with new customers at comparable day rates 
consolidation of the company s customer base oil and natural gas companies  energy companies and drilling contractors have undergone consolidation  and additional consolidation is possible 
consolidation reduces the number of customers for the company s equipment  and may negatively affect exploration  field development and production activity as consolidated companies focus on increasing efficiency and reducing costs and delay or abandon exploration activity with less promise 
such activity could adversely affect demand for the company s vessels and reduce the company s revenues 
unconventional natural gas sources are exerting downward pricing pressures on the price of natural gas the rise in production of unconventional gas resources onshore shale plays resulting from technological advancements in horizontal drilling and fracturing in north america and the commissioning of a number of new large liquefied natural gas lng export facilities around the world are contributing to an over supplied natural gas market 
while production of natural gas from unconventional sources is a relatively small portion of the worldwide natural gas production  it is increasing because improved drilling efficiencies are lowering the costs of extraction 
there is a significant oversupply of natural gas inventories in the united states in part due to the increase of unconventional gas in the market 
prolonged increases in the worldwide supply of natural gas  whether from conventional or unconventional sources  will likely continue to suppress natural gas prices 
a prolonged period of suppressed natural gas prices would likely have a negative impact on development plans of exploration and production companies  which in turn  may result in a decrease in demand for offshore support vessel services 
this effect could be particularly acute in our us operating segment  which is more oriented towards natural gas than crude oil production  and therefore more sensitive to the changes in the market pricing for natural gas than to changes in the market pricing of crude oil

index to financial statements challenging macroeconomic conditions uncertainty about future global economic market conditions makes it challenging to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments 
the success of our business is both directly and indirectly dependent upon conditions in the global financial and credit markets that are outside of our control and difficult to predict 
uncertain economic conditions may lead our customers to postpone capital spending in response to tighter credit and reductions in income or asset values 
similarly  when lenders and institutional investors reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide funding to corporate and other industrial borrowers  the liquidity and financial condition of our customers can be adversely impacted 
these factors may also adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 
factors such as interest rates  availability of credit  inflation rates  economic uncertainty  changes in laws including laws relating to taxation  trade barriers  commodity prices  currency exchange rates and controls  and national and international political circumstances including wars  terrorist acts or security operations can have a material negative effect on our business and operations  which in turn would reduce our revenues and profitability 
prolonged material economic downturns in crude oil and natural gas prices can negatively affect the development plans of exploration and production companies 
in addition  a prolonged recession may result in a decrease in demand for offshore support vessel services and a reduction in charter rates and or utilization rates  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
prior to mid  oil and gas companies had increased their respective exploration and field development activities in response to a very favorable pricing environment for oil and gas that existed at that time 
worldwide demand for crude oil and natural gas dropped precipitously and energy prices sharply declined as a result of a global economic recession 
two years later  there are signs that economic improvement is underway  however  the pace of recovery and demand for energy and  in turn  offshore supply vessel services has been slow to recover 
in addition  the recent increases in crude oil prices  resulting from higher demand for hydrocarbons and civil unrest in the middle east and north african oil producing and exporting countries  has renewed economists concerns that high energy prices could imperil the economic recovery  although high commodity pricing generally bodes well for the energy industry 
potential overcapacity in the offshore marine industry over the past decade  construction of offshore vessels of the types the company operates has increased significantly 
excess offshore supply vessel capacity likewise usually exerts downward pressure on charter rates 
excess capacity can occur when newly constructed vessels enter the market and when vessels are mobilized between market areas 
while the company is committed to the construction of additional vessels  it has also sold and or scrapped a significant number of vessels over the last several years 
a discussion about the aging of the company s fleet  which has necessitated the company s new vessel construction programs  appears in the vessel count  dispositions  acquisitions and construction programs section of item in this report 
the offshore supply vessel market has approximately new build offshore support vessels platform supply vessels and anchor handlers only that are currently estimated to be under construction and that are expected to be delivered to the worldwide offshore vessel market over the next three and a half years  according to ods petrodata 
the current worldwide fleet of these classes of vessels is estimated at approximately  vessels 
an increase in vessel capacity could result in increased competition in the company s industry which may have the effect of lowering charter rates and utilization rates  which  in turn  would result in lower revenues to the company 
also  please read potential repeal or amendment of the shipping act may have an adverse impact on the company s us segment risk below for additional information that can increase vessels overcapacity in our us segment 
risks associated with vessel construction and maintenance the company has a number of vessels currently under construction  and it may construct additional vessels in response to current and future market conditions 
in addition  the company routinely engages shipyards to drydock vessels for regulatory compliance and to provide repair and maintenance services 
construction projects and drydockings are subject to risks of delay and cost overruns  resulting from shortages of equipment  materials and skilled labor  lack of shipyard availability  unforeseen design and engineering problems  work stoppages  weather interference  unanticipated cost increases  unscheduled delays in the delivery of material 
table of contents 
index to financial statements and equipment  financial and other difficulties at shipyards including labor disputes and shipyard insolvency  and inability to obtain necessary certifications and approvals 
a significant delay in either construction or drydockings of vessels could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fulfill contract commitments and to realize timely revenues with respect to vessels under construction  conversion or other drydockings 
significant cost overruns or delays for vessels under construction could also adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the demand for vessels currently under construction may diminish from levels originally anticipated 
if the company fails to obtain favorable contracts for newly constructed vessels  such failure could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues and profitability 
also  difficult economic market conditions and or prolonged distress in credit and capital markets may hamper the ability of shipyards to meet their scheduled deliveries of new vessels or the ability of the company to renew its fleet through new vessel construction or acquisitions 
in addition  there is always the risk of insolvency of the shipyards that construct or drydock our vessels  which could adversely affect our new construction program  and consequently  adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
risks associated with operating internationally for the fiscal years ended march   and    and  respectively  of the company s total revenues were generated by its international segment 
the company s international vessel operations are vulnerable to many risks inherent in doing business in countries other than the united states  some of which have recently become more pronounced 
our customary risks of operating internationally include political and economic instability within the host country  possible vessel seizures or nationalization of assets and other governmental actions by the host country please refer to item in this report and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our venezuelan operations regarding vessel seizures  foreign government regulations that favor or require the awarding of contracts to local competitors  an inability to recruit and retain management of overseas operations  currency fluctuations  revaluations  devaluations and restrictions on repatriation of currency  and import export quotas and restrictions most of which are beyond the control of the company 
the company is also subject to acts of piracy and kidnappings that put its assets and personnel at risk 
the increase in the level of these criminal or terrorist acts over the last few years has been well publicized 
as a marine services company that usually operates in offshore  coastal or tidal waters  the company is particularly vulnerable to these kinds of unlawful activities 
although the company takes what it considers to be prudent measures to protect its personnel and assets in markets that present these risks  it has confronted these kinds of incidents in the past  and there can be no assurance it will not be subjected to them in the future 
the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility have significantly increased the risk of political  economic and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which the company operates 
it is possible that further acts of terrorism may be directed against the united states domestically or abroad and such acts of terrorism could be directed against properties and personnel of us owned companies such as ours 
to date  the company has not experienced any material adverse effects on its results of operations and financial condition as a result of terrorism  political instability or war 
international operations exposed to currency devaluation and fluctuation risk due to the company s international operations  the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks on all charter hire contracts denominated in foreign currencies 
for some of our international contracts  a portion of the revenue and local expenses are incurred in local currencies and the company is at risk of changes in the exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies 
we generally do not hedge against any foreign currency rate fluctuations associated with foreign currency contracts that arise in the normal course of business  which exposes us to the risk of exchange rate losses 
gains and losses from the revaluation of our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our functional currency are included in our consolidated statements of operations 
foreign currency fluctuations may cause the us dollar value of our international results of operations and net assets to vary with exchange rate fluctuations 
this could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in addition  fluctuations in 
table of contents 
index to financial statements currencies relative to currencies in which the earnings are generated may make it more difficult to perform period to period comparisons of our reported results of operations 
to minimize the financial impact of these items  the company attempts to contract a significant majority of its services in us dollars 
in addition  the company attempts to minimize its financial impact of these risks  by matching the currency of the company s operating costs with the currency of revenue streams when considered appropriate 
the company continually monitors the currency exchange risks associated with all contracts not denominated in us dollars 
operational hazards inherent to the offshore marine vessel industry the operation of any marine vessel involves inherent risk that could adversely affect our financial performance if we are not adequately insured or indemnified 
our operations are also subject to various operating hazards and risks  including risk of catastrophic marine disaster  adverse sea and weather conditions  mechanical failure  collisions and property losses to the vessel  damage to and loss of drilling rigs and production facilities  war  sabotage  pirate and terrorism risks  and business interruption due to political action or inaction  including nationalization of assets by foreign governments 
these risks present a threat to the safety of personnel and to our vessels  cargo  equipment under tow and other property  as well as the environment 
any such event may result in a reduction in revenues  increased costs  property damage  and additionally  third parties may have significant claims against us for damages due to personal injury  death  property damage  pollution and loss of business 
our vessels are generally insured for their estimated market value against damage or loss  including war  terrorism acts  and pollution risks  but the company does not fully insure for business interruption 
our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles and certain exclusions 
we can provide no assurance  however  that our insurance coverage will be available beyond the renewal periods  that we will be able to obtain insurance for all operational risks and that our insurance policies will be adequate to cover future claims that may arise 
compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide anti bribery laws our international operations require us to comply with a number of us and international laws and regulations  including those involving anti bribery and anti corruption 
in order to effectively compete in certain foreign jurisdictions  the company seeks to establish joint ventures with local operators or strategic partners 
as a us corporation  the company is subject to the regulations imposed by the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa  which generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or obtaining an improper business benefit 
the company has adopted proactive procedures to promote compliance with the fcpa  but it may be held liable for actions taken by its strategic or local partners or agents even though these partners or agents may not themselves be subjected to the fcpa 
any determination that the company has violated the fcpa could have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations  and cash flows 
a full discussion of the company s fcpa internal investigation is disclosed in the internal investigation section of note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
compliance with complex and developing laws and regulations the company s us and international segment operations are subject to many complex and burdensome laws and regulations 
stringent federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations governing worker health and safety and the manning  construction and operation of vessels significantly affect our operations 
many aspects of the marine industry are subject to extensive governmental regulation by the united states coast guard and the united states customs and border protection and their foreign equivalents  and to regulation by private industry organizations such as the american bureau of shipping  the oil companies international marine forum  and the international marine contractors association 
the company s operations are also subject to federal  state  local and international laws and regulations that control the discharge of pollutants into the environment or otherwise relate to environmental protection 
compliance with such laws and regulations may require installation of costly equipment  increased manning or 
table of contents 
index to financial statements operational changes 
some environmental laws impose strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances  which could subject the company to liability without regard to whether the company was negligent or at fault 
further  many of the countries in which the company operates have laws  regulations and enforcement systems that are largely undeveloped  and the requirements of these systems are not always readily discernable even to experienced and proactive participants 
further  these laws  regulations and enforcement systems can be unpredictable and subject to frequent change or reinterpretation  sometimes with retroactive effect  and with associated taxes  fees  or penalties sought from the company based on that reinterpretation or retroactive effect 
while the company endeavors to comply with applicable laws and regulations  the company s compliance efforts might not always be wholly successful  and failure to comply may result in administrative and civil penalties  criminal sanctions  imposition of remedial obligations or the suspension or termination of the company s operations 
these laws and regulations may expose the company to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others  including charterers or third party agents 
moreover  these laws and regulations could be changed or be interpreted in new  unexpected ways that substantially increase costs that the company may not be able to pass along to its customers 
any changes in laws  regulations or standards that would impose additional requirements or restrictions could adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in order to meet the continuing challenge of complying with applicable laws and regulations in jurisdictions where it operates  the company revitalized and strengthened its compliance training  makes available and uses a worldwide compliance reporting system and performs compliance auditing monitoring 
the company appointed its general counsel as its chief compliance officer in fiscal to help organize and lead these compliance efforts 
this strengthened compliance program may from time to time identify past practices that need to be changed or remediated 
such corrective or remedial measures could involve significant expenditures or lead to changes in operational practices that could adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we are subject to the merchant marine act of  which provides that  upon proclamation by the president of the united states of a national emergency or a threat to the security of the national defense  the secretary of transportation may requisition or purchase any vessel or other watercraft owned by us citizens including us corporations  including vessels under construction in the united states 
if our vessels were purchased or requisitioned by the us federal government  we would be entitled to be paid the fair market value of the vessels in the case of a purchase or  in the case of a requisition  the fair market value of charter hire  but we would not be entitled to be compensated for any consequential damages suffered 
although the purchase or requisition of one or a few of our vessels for an extended period of time will not cause adverse material negative financial effects to our company  the purchase or requisition of several or a significant number of our vessels for an extended period of time may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
risk of changes in laws governing us taxation of foreign source income we operate globally through various subsidiaries which are subject to changes in applicable tax laws  treaties or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business  including laws or policies directed toward companies organized in jurisdictions with low tax rates 
a material change in the tax laws or policies  or their interpretation  of any country in which we conduct business  or in which we are incorporated or resident  could result in a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings  and such change could be significant to our financial results 
approximately of the company s revenues and net income are generated by its operations outside of the united states 
the company s effective tax rate has averaged approximately since fiscal  primarily a result of the passage of the american jobs creation act of  which excluded from the company s current taxable income in the us income earned offshore through the company s controlled foreign subsidiaries 
periodically  tax legislative initiatives are proposed to effectively increase us taxation of income with respect to foreign operations 
whether any such initiatives will win congressional or executive approval and become law is presently unknown  however  if any such initiatives were to become law  and were such law to apply to the company s international operations  it would result in a materially higher tax expense  which would have a 
table of contents 
index to financial statements material impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  and which could cause the company to review the utility of continued us domicile 
in addition  our income tax returns are subject to review and examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities where tax returns are filed 
the company routinely evaluates the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes 
we do not recognize the benefit of income tax positions we believe are more likely than not to be disallowed upon challenge by a tax authority 
if any tax authority successfully challenges our operational structure or intercompany transfer pricing policies  or if the terms of certain income tax treaties are interpreted in a manner that is adverse to our structure  or if we lose a material tax dispute in any country  our effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings could increase  and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
potential repeal or amendment of the shipping act may have an adverse impact on the company s us segment the provisions of the shipping act restricting coastwise trade to vessels controlled by us citizens may from time to time be circumvented by foreign competitors that seek to engage in trade reserved for vessels controlled by us citizens and otherwise qualifying for coastwise trade 
there have also been attempts to repeal or amend the citizen provision of the shipping act  and these attempts are expected to continue 
legal challenges against such actions are difficult  costly to pursue and unpredictable 
to the extent foreign competition is permitted to engage in us coastwise trade by vessels that are built in lower cost shipyards  owned and manned by foreign nationals with favorable foreign tax incentives and with lower wages and benefits than us citizens  such increased competition could have a material adverse effect on the company s us segment operations 
however  for the fiscal years ended march   and    and  respectively  of the company s vessel revenues were generated by its international segment 
compliance with environmental regulations may adversely impact our operations and markets a variety of regulatory developments  proposals and requirements have been introduced in the us and various other countries that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide  methane and other gases 
if such legislation is enacted  increased cost of energy as well as environmental and other costs and capital expenditures could be necessary to comply with the limitations 
these developments may curtail production and demand for hydrocarbons such as crude oil and natural gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for the company s offshore supply vessels  which are highly dependent on the level of activity in offshore oil and natural gas exploration  development and production market 
although it is unlikely that demand for oil and gas will lessen dramatically over the short term  in the long term  demand for oil and gas or increased regulation of environmental regulations may create greater incentives for use of alternative energy sources 
unless and until legislation is enacted and its terms are known  we cannot reasonably or reliably estimate its impact on our financial condition  results of operations and ability to compete 
however  any long term material adverse effect on the crude oil and natural gas industry may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the deepwater horizon incident and effects of the drilling moratorium in the us gulf of mexico could have a material significant impact on exploration and production activities in united states coastal waters that could adversely affect the u 
s 
operations of the company as we are an energy service company  the success and profitability of our operations in the united states are dependent on the level of upstream drilling and exploration activity in the us gom  and to a lesser extent on the west coast of the united states and in alaska 
in particular  many of our new build vessels were designed to operate in deep water off the continental shelf to assist in drilling and exploration efforts in those areas 
since fiscal  between and of our revenues in the us gom have come from our deepwater vessels  and the margins that we earn on deepwater vessels have typically been higher than margins we achieve on other classes of our vessels 
although the boemre has begun to issue new drilling permits  the pace remains slow  and in any event  the new rules and requirements could continue to suppress the level of drilling activity and the demand for our services  which could have a material adverse effect on our us operations 
in 
table of contents 
index to financial statements addition  if exploration and production activity migrates from the us gom to international markets because of the additional regulations and higher operating costs in the us gom  it is also possible that other offshore supply vessel owners will redeploy additional vessels to international markets 
these mobilizations could increase competition and have a negative effect on vessel utilization and day rates in international markets  depending on the number of drilling rigs that exit the us gom and move to international markets 
also among the uncertainties that confront the industry are whether congress will repeal the million cap for non reclamation liabilities under the oil pollution act of and whether insurance will continue to be available at a reasonable cost and with reasonable policy limits to support drilling and exploration activity in the us gom 
although the eventual outcome of these developments is currently unknown  we believe that  even in the best case for the industry that we serve  additional regulatory and operational costs will be incurred  and these additional costs may either reduce the level of exploratory activity in the us gom  reduce demand for our services  or both

fiscal business highlights and key focus during fiscal  the company continued its focus on maintaining its competitive advantages and its market share in international markets where it operates  and continued to modernize its vessel fleet to generate future earnings capacity while removing from active service certain traditional vessels that currently have fewer market opportunities because customer demand for such vessels has declined significantly 
key elements of the company s strategy continue to be the preservation of its strong financial position and the maintenance of adequate liquidity to fund the expansion of its fleet of newer vessels 
operating management focused on safe operations and maintaining disciplined cost control 
the company s strategy contemplates the possible acquisitions of vessels and or other owners and operators of offshore supply vessels as well as organic growth through the construction of vessels at a variety of shipyards worldwide

macroeconomic environment and outlook the primary driver of our business  and therefore revenues  is the level of our customers capital and operating expenditures for oil and natural gas exploration  field development and production 
these expenditures  in turn  generally reflect our customers expectations for future oil and natural gas prices  economic growth  hydrocarbon demand and estimates of current and future oil and natural gas production 
the prices of crude oil and natural gas are critical factors in exploration and production e p companies decisions to contract drilling rigs and offshore service vessels in the united states us gulf of mexico gom or in international markets  with the international market being driven by supply and demand for crude oil  and the us gom being influenced both by the supply and demand for natural gas in regards to shallow water activity and the supply and demand for crude oil in regards to deepwater activity 

table of contents 
index to financial statements crude oil prices gradually recovered and stabilized in the range of to per barrel during the majority of calendar year due to signs of improvement in the global economy  lead by emerging economies  and  in part  because the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec reduced its crude oil production targets by more than over the past years in an effort to stabilize crude oil prices 
crude oil prices have increased since the beginning of calendar year as colder than normal winter weather in north america and the euro zone translated into higher demand for crude oil 
in addition  crude oil prices have increased due to bullish sentiment about supply tightness in calendar year due to continued improvements in the global economy  along with concerns related to potential supply interruptions and disruptions due to the political tensions in the middle east and north africa 
during the last scheduled opec meeting  held in mid december  opec officials voted to maintain its existing production targets asserting that worldwide crude oil supplies were well balanced with crude oil stocks above five year averages and that opec holds excess spare capacity which can be made available to the market should crude oil prices increase to levels that could possibly jeopardize the global economic recovery that is underway 
although a global economic recovery is underway  demand for offshore vessel services was slow to recover in fiscal from the demand weakness experienced the last two fiscal years resulting from the global recession 
the company expects that utilization and day rates for its internationally based vessels will continue to be correlated with crude oil prices  which in mid april were trading around per barrel for west texas intermediate crude and for intercontinental exchange ice brent crude 
the significant increase in oil prices bodes well for increases in drilling and exploration activity and resulting demand for the company s vessels in the various international markets and the deepwater of the us gom assuming the pace of permits increases 
prices for natural gas were generally bearish throughout calendar year due to the rise in production of unconventional gas resources in north america onshore shale plays resulting from technological advancements in horizontal drilling and fracturing and the commissioning of a number of new large liquefied natural gas lng exporting facilities around the world  which are contributing to an over supplied natural gas market 
since december  colder than normal winter weather in the north america and the euro zone caused a spike in natural gas prices  that continued throughout the first quarter of calendar year  as increases in demand for natural gas were met with production disruptions resulting from the cold weather and the potential for a future increase in demand for the resource by japan as the country starts to rebuild from the devastating effects of the earthquake and tsunami that struck the country in march despite recent improvements in demand for natural gas  inventories for the resource in the us continue to be oversupplied and have grown year over year by approximately five bcf per day 
as of mid april  prices were trading in the to mcf range 
analysts expect prices to decrease during calendar year if a dramatic slowdown does not occur in natural gas production 
high natural gas inventories exert downward pricing pressures on the resource 
while production of natural gas from unconventional sources is still a relatively small portion of the worldwide natural gas production  it is increasing because improved drilling efficiencies are lowering the costs of extraction 
prolonged increases in the supply of natural gas  whether the supply comes from conventional or unconventional production  will suppress prices for natural gas 
a prolonged downturn in natural gas prices can negatively impact the offshore exploration and development plans of e p companies  which in turn  would result in a decrease in demand for offshore support vessel services  primarily in the company s us segment 
certain oil and gas industry analysts are reporting in their e p expenditures both land based and offshore surveys that global capital expenditure budgets for e p companies are forecast to increase by approximately over calendar year levels 
the surveys forecast that international capital spending budgets will increase approximately  while north american capital spending budgets are forecast to increase approximately 
the industry analysts reports that the gains in international spending will be led by the super major international oil companies and the national oil companies 
it is anticipated that the north american capital budget increases will primarily be spent onshore rather than offshore 
capital expenditure budgets incorporated into the spending surveys were based on an approximate average price per barrel of oil and an approximate per mcf average natural gas price for calendar historically  when the us market weakened  the company would redeploy some of its highly mobile assets to international markets where  market conditions permitting  the vessels could benefit from stronger demand and average day rates and from statutory income tax rates that are generally lower than those in the us the company s ability to mitigate the effects of a weak us gom market by redeploying vessels to other markets could be reduced due to the recent challenges in international markets 
the company continues to assess the demand for vessels in the us gom and in the various international markets and may relocate additional

index to financial statements vessels to international areas and between international areas if and when the need arises 
the cost of mobilizing vessels to a different market is sometimes for the account of the company and sometimes for the account of a contracting customer  depending upon market conditions within a particular market 
in recent years  international deepwater activity has been a growing part of the worldwide offshore crude oil and natural gas markets and a source of growth for the company 
international deepwater activity did not experience significant negative effects from the global economic recession  largely because deepwater oil and gas development typically involves significant capital investment and multi year development plans 
such projects are generally underwritten by the participating exploration  development and production companies using relatively conservative assumptions relating to crude oil and natural gas prices 
these projects are therefore considered less susceptible to short term fluctuations in the price of crude oil and natural gas 
during the past few years  worldwide rig construction increased as rig owners capitalized on the high worldwide demand for drilling 
reports published during the most recently completed quarter suggest that over the next five and a half years and beyond  the worldwide movable drilling rig count currently estimated at approximately movable offshore rigs worldwide  approximately thirty percent of which are designed to operate in deeper waters will increase as approximately new build offshore rigs that are currently on order and under construction are delivered 
of the estimated movable offshore rigs worldwide  approximately are currently working 
it is further estimated that approximately of the new build rigs are built to operate in deeper waters  suggesting that the number of rigs designed to operate in deeper waters could grow in the coming years by approximately one third 
investment is also being made in the floating production market  with approximately new floating production units currently under construction and are expected to be delivered over the next six and a half years and beyond to supplement the current approximately floating production units worldwide 
to the extent the rigs are built and delivered  it is believed that the new build rigs will largely target international regions rather than the us gom due to longer contract durations  generally lower operating costs including insurance costs and higher drilling day rates available in the international markets 
additional and future regulatory oversight and control with respect to offshore drilling in the us gom following the explosion of the deepwater horizon may also increase the relative appeal of international markets 
according to ods petrodata  the global offshore supply vessel market has approximately new build offshore support vessels platform supply vessels and anchor handlers only at march   that are currently estimated to be under construction and that are expected to be delivered to the worldwide offshore vessel market primarily over the next three and half years 
the current worldwide fleet of these classes of vessels is estimated at approximately  vessels  of which we estimate in excess of are stacked 
an increase in worldwide vessel capacity could have the effect of lowering charter rates  particularly when there are lower levels of exploration  field development and production activity 
the worldwide offshore marine vessel industry  however  also has a large number of aging vessels  including more than vessels  or approximately of the worldwide offshore fleet  that are at least years old  that are nearing or exceeding original expectations of their estimated economic lives 
these older vessels could potentially be removed from the market within the next few years if the cost of extending the vessels lives is not economically justifiable 
although the future attrition rate of these aging vessels cannot be accurately predicted  the company believes that the retirement of a sizeable portion of these aging vessels would likely mitigate the potential combined negative effects of new build vessels on vessel utilization and vessel pricing 
additional vessel demand could also be created with the addition of new drilling rigs and floating production units that are expected to be delivered and become operational over the next few years  which should help minimize the possible negative effects of the new build offshore support vessels being added to the offshore support vessel fleet 
it is unknown at this time the extent to which the recovery from the recent worldwide recession will influence the utilization of equipment currently in existence or the ultimate timing of delivery and placing into service of new drilling rigs  floating production units and vessels currently under construction 
principal factors that drive our revenues the company s revenues  net earnings and cash flows from operations are largely dependent upon the activity level of its offshore marine vessel fleet 
as is the case with other energy service companies  our business activity is largely dependent on the level of drilling and exploration activity by our customers 
our customers business activity  in turn  is dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices  which fluctuate depending on expected future levels of supply and demand for crude oil and natural gas  and on estimates of the cost to find  develop and produce reserves 
in addition  since the deepwater horizon incident  the level of drilling activity off 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the continental shelf of the us gom has diminished while the us government evaluated the causes of the incident and announced a plan for enhanced regulatory and safety oversight as a condition to granting additional drilling and exploration permits 
as of march   fewer than drilling permits for deepwater exploration activity had been issued since the deepwater horizon incident in april the company s revenues in both the international and united states segments are driven primarily by the company s fleet size  vessel utilization and day rates 
because a sizeable portion of the company s operating costs and its depreciation does not change proportionally with changes in revenue  the company s operating profit is largely dependent on revenue levels 
principal factors that drive our operating costs operating costs consist primarily of crew costs  repair and maintenance  insurance and loss reserves  fuel  lube oil and supplies and vessel operating lease expense 
fleet size  fleet composition  geographic areas of operation  supply and demand for marine personnel  and local labor requirements are the major factors which affect overall crew costs in both the international and united states segments 
in addition  the company s newer  more technologically sophisticated anchor handling towing supply vessels and platform supply vessels generally require a greater number of specially trained fleet personnel than the company s older  smaller vessels 
the company believes that competition for skilled crew personnel may again intensify  particularly in international markets  as new build support vessels currently under construction increase the number of offshore vessels operating worldwide 
if competition for personnel intensifies  the company s crew costs will likely increase 
the timing and amount of repair and maintenance costs are influenced by customer demand  vessel age and safety and inspection drydockings mandated by regulatory agencies 
a certain number of drydockings are required within a given period to meet regulatory requirements 
drydocking costs are incurred only if the company believes a drydocking can be justified economically  taking into consideration the vessel s age  physical condition and future marketability 
if the company elects to forego a required drydocking  the company will stack and possibly sell the vessel  as the vessel is not permitted to work without valid regulatory certifications 
when the company drydocks a productive vessel  the company not only foregoes vessel revenues and incurs drydocking cost  but also continues to incur vessel operating costs and vessel depreciation 
in any given period  downtime associated with drydockings and major repairs and maintenance can have a significant effect on the company s revenues and operating costs 
at times  vessel drydockings take on an increased significance to the company and its financial performance 
older vessels typically require more frequent and more expensive repairs and drydockings 
newer vessels generally those built after  which now account for a majority of the company s revenues and vessel margin vessel revenues less vessel operating cost  can also result in expensive drydockings  even in the early years of a vessel s useful life due to these vessels larger relative size and greater relative complexity 
conversely  when the company stacks vessels  the number of drydockings in any period could decline 
the combination of these factors can affect drydock costs  which are primarily included in repair and maintenance expense  and incrementally increase the volatility of the company s revenues and operating income  thus making period to period comparisons more difficult 
although the company attempts to efficiently manage its fleet drydocking schedule to minimize the disruptive effect on its revenues and costs  changes in the demand for and supply of shipyard services can result in heavy workloads at shipyards and inflationary pressure on shipyard pricing 
in recent years  increases in drydocking costs and days off hire due to vessels being drydocked contributed to volatility in repair and maintenance costs and revenue 
in addition  some of the more recently constructed vessels are now experiencing their first or second required regulatory drydockings 
insurance and loss reserves costs are dependent on a variety of factors  including the company s safety record and the cost of insurance  and can fluctuate from time to time 
the company s vessels are generally insured for up to their estimated fair market value in order to cover damage or loss resulting from marine casualties  adverse weather conditions  mechanical failure  collisions  and property losses to the vessel 
the company also purchases coverage for third party liability losses with limits that it believes are reasonable for its operations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements insurance limits are reviewed annually and third party coverage is purchased based on the expected scope of on going operations and the cost of third party coverage 
fuel and lube costs can also fluctuate in any given period depending on the number and distance of vessel mobilizations and drydockings in addition to changes in fuel prices 
the company also incurs vessel operating costs that are aggregated under the other vessel operating cost heading 
these costs consist of brokers commissions  training costs and other miscellaneous costs 
brokers commission costs are incurred primarily in the company s international operations where brokers sometimes assist in obtaining work for the company s vessels 
brokers generally are paid a percentage of day rates and  accordingly  commissions paid to brokers generally fluctuate in accordance with vessel revenue 
other costs include  but are not limited to  satellite communication fees  agent fees  port fees  canal transit fees  vessel certification fees and temporary vessel importation fees

a significant portion of the company s operations are conducted internationally  therefore  the company s international vessel operations are the primary driver of its revenue and earnings 
revenues generated from international vessel operations  as a percentage of the company s total vessel revenues  was during fiscal and fiscal vessel revenues generated by the company s international segment decreased approximately million  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal  while vessel revenues generated by the us segment decreased approximately million  or  during the same comparative periods 
in part  the decline in revenues reflected the vessel seizures in venezuela in mid with fiscal including million of revenues generated by the company s venezuelan operations 
other marine revenues decreased approximately million  or  during the same comparative periods primarily because ship construction at the company s shipyards was completed on several projects and the shipyard has not been able to secure additional backlog 
international segment vessel operating costs increased approximately  or million  while the company s us segment vessel operating costs decreased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal costs of other marine revenues decreased approximately million  or  during the same comparative periods

international segment operations 
the company s international results of operations are primarily dependent on the supply and demand relationship for crude oil 
during fiscal  internationally based vessel utilization rates decreased approximately six percentage points as compared to fiscal due principally to reduced demand for the company s traditional vessels by our customers 
e p customers reduced their capital spending budgets in response to lower hydrocarbon demand and weaker commodity prices precipitated by the global economic recession 
the global recession resulted in a decrease in demand for offshore support vessel services worldwide 
this reduced demand has led to an industry wide reduction in charter rates and utilization rates on vessels as our customers needed fewer vessels and demanded pricing concessions 
internationally based vessel revenues decreased  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to an approximate percentage point decrease in utilization rates and decrease in average day rates on the towing supply supply class of vessels as a result of weaker demand for this vessel class 
in addition  the company s revenues decreased because of the loss of revenue from the seizure of its venezuelan operations in may and july of the company s venezuelan operations contributed no revenues during fiscal as compared to million of revenues contributed during fiscal the or million  decline in the towing supply supply class of vessels revenue  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  was partially offset by an  or million increase in revenue earned by the company s deepwater class of vessels due to the addition of deepwater vessels to the international fleet throughout fiscal and fiscal following the addition of newly built and acquired deepwater vessels to the fleet and the transfer of deepwater class vessels from the us gom market 
average day rates for all internationally based vessels during fiscal were comparable to the average day rates achieved during fiscal  which reflects a change in the mix of vessels operating during fiscal as a general matter  leading edge day rates are declining across vessel classes  however  the impact of this decline on average day rate statistics has been mitigated by vessel charter contracts entered into in fiscal and prior years and a change in the mix of vessels that worked during fiscal  relative to fiscal in particular  the company added new vessels to the fleet since the first quarter of fiscal and stacked older  traditional vessels throughout fiscal and fiscal  and the traditional vessels generally earn lower day rates than newer vessels 
as a result  the average working vessel during fiscal earned a higher average day rate than the average working vessel during fiscal 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the company continued to stack and remove from its active fleet of internationally based vessels those vessels that could not find attractive charter contracts 
at the beginning of fiscal  the company had internationally based vessels that were stacked 
during fiscal  the company stacked additional vessels  sold and or disposed of vessels from the previously stacked vessel fleet  and returned to international service one vessel  with the net result being a total of stacked internationally based vessels as of march  vessel utilization rates are calculated by dividing the number of days a vessel works by the number of days the vessel is available to work 
our higher number of stacked vessels depressed international utilization rates during the comparative periods because stacked vessels are considered available to work and are included in the calculation of utilization rates 
the company s towing supply supply vessels were the source of the majority of the revenue decline realized during fiscal as compared to fiscal this class of vessels accounted for approximately million of the revenue decline a reduction during fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to a percentage point decrease in utilization rates and an approximate decrease in average day rates  primarily reflecting weaker demand for the company s vessels and particularly the company s traditional vessels and the seizure of vessels by the venezuelan government 
the company s crew utility class of vessels were responsible for approximately million of the decline in revenue an reduction during the same comparative periods due to lower average day rates because of weaker demand for such vessels and due to fewer crewboats operating internationally  primarily due to vessel sales 
increased revenue generated by the company s deepwater class of vessels partially offset revenue losses incurred by the other vessel classes operating in the international segment 
revenues earned by the deepwater class of vessels increased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to stable utilization rates  despite an approximate decrease in average day rates  during the comparative periods and  more importantly  due to an increase in the number of deepwater vessels operating in the international market following the addition of newly built and acquired deepwater vessels to the fleet and because of three deepwater vessels mobilizing to international markets from the us gom during the third quarter of fiscal vessel revenues  utilization percentages and average day rates by vessel class for the international segment are disclosed in the vessel class revenues and statistics by segment section of this report 
vessel operating profit for internationally based vessels decreased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  because of lower revenues and  or million  higher operating costs during the comparative periods 
vessel operating profit also decreased during the same comparative periods because of an approximate  or million  increase in depreciation expense 
depreciation expense increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal because of newly constructed and acquired vessels that were added to the international fleet and because of the mobilization of vessels from the us gom to international markets during the third quarter of fiscal also  fiscal vessel operating profit includes a million provision for venezuelan operations as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
crew costs increased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to an increase in the number of internationally based vessels and because of a million charge associated with the company s participation in the merchant navy officers pension fund mnopf as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
repair and maintenance costs increased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal this trend largely reflects a greater number of drydockings being performed during the current fiscal year 
in particular  during fiscal  we performed four scheduled drydockings of our largest anchor handling towing supply vessel class of vessels for an aggregate cost of million as compared to one drydocking being performed on the same class of vessel during fiscal for a total cost of million 
international vessel operating lease costs increased approximately million  or  during fiscal because the company entered into six additional vessel operating leases during fiscal  as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements and in the off balance sheet arrangements section of this report  and because one vessel operating under an operating lease transferred from the us gom to an international market during the third quarter of fiscal fuel  lube and supply costs were higher by approximately  or million  respectively  during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to vessel mobilizations on the company s newly delivered vessels and because of vessels mobilizing from one international area to a different international area 
insurance and loss reserves increased approximately million due to an increase in the number of vessels operating internationally and due to unfavorable development of losses during the current fiscal year

the company s united states results of operations are primarily dependent on the supply and demand relationship for natural gas in regards to shallow water activity and the supply and demand for crude oil in regards to deepwater activity 
during fiscal  vessel day rates in the us gom offshore vessel market trended higher as the normal supply demand fundamentals were affected by the strong demand for vessels to assist with the us gulf oil spill response effort following the catastrophic explosion of the deepwater horizon in april increased demand for the company s vessels helped drive utilization rates for the company s us segment higher during fiscal as compared to the same periods during fiscal all of the company s available for work us segment vessels were working at relatively full utilization  including a number of the company s vessels assisting with the oil spill containment effort that was underway during the first half of fiscal  however  by september  vessel demand related to the oil spill containment effort had declined significantly 
vessel revenues from the us based vessels decreased a modest  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  as a result of lower revenues generated on the us based crew utility class of vessels primarily due to the disposition of vessels resulting from weak demand for the company s crewboats in the us gom market

international segment operations 
the company s international results of operations are primarily dependent on the supply and demand relationship for crude oil 
during fiscal  internationally based vessel utilization rates decreased approximately seven percentage points as compared to fiscal due to the global economic recession 
e p customers reduced their capital spending budgets in response to lower hydrocarbon demand and weaker commodity prices 
during fiscal  the global recession resulted in a decrease in demand for offshore support vessel services 
this reduction in demand led to an industry wide reduction in charter rates and utilization rates on vessels as our customers demanded pricing concessions 

table of contents 
index to financial statements internationally based vessel revenues decreased million  or  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to an approximate seven percentage point decrease in utilization rates on vessels operating in international markets  reflecting weaker demand for the company s vessels 
average day rates for internationally based vessels increased a relatively modest during fiscal as compared to fiscal higher average day rates for internationally based vessels reflected a change in the mix of vessels operating during fiscal compared to fiscal leading edge day rates generally had been declining across vessel classes  however  the impact of the decline on average day rate statistics was mitigated by a change in the mix of vessels that were working in fiscal relative to fiscal in particular  the company stacked a number of traditional vessels in fiscal and the traditional vessels generally earned lower day rates than the newer vessels 
as a result  the average working vessel in fiscal earned a higher day rate than the average working vessel in fiscal in addition  the company s revenues decreased during the comparative periods because of the loss of revenue from the seizure of its venezuelan operations 
the company s venezuelan operations contributed million of revenues during fiscal as compared to million of revenues contributed during fiscal during fiscal  the company continued to stack and remove from its internationally based active fleet vessels that could not find attractive charter hire contracts 
at the beginning of fiscal  the company had internationally based stacked vessels 
during fiscal  the company stacked additional vessels  sold vessels from the previously stacked vessel fleet  and returned to international service three vessels  resulting in a total of internationally based stacked vessels as of march  vessel utilization rates are calculated by dividing the number of days a vessel works by the number of days the vessel is available to work 
stacked internationally based vessels depressed international utilization rates during the comparative periods because stacked vessels are considered available to work  and as such  are included in the calculation of utilization rates 
the company s towing supply supply class of vessels were responsible for approximately  or million  of the loss in revenue during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in the number of towing supply supply vessels operating in the international market because of vessel sales  the seizure of vessels by the venezuelan government  and because of lower utilization rates resulting from weaker demand for the company vessels that continued to operate internationally 
the company s crew utility class of vessels were responsible for approximately  or million  of the loss in revenue during the same comparative periods due to lower utilization and average day rates because of weaker demand for the company s crew utility class of vessels 
the company s internationally based offshore tugs were responsible for approximately  or million  of the loss in revenue during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to lower utilization and average day rates and to a decrease in the number of offshore tugs operating in the international market because of vessel sales and the seizure of vessels by the venezuelan government 
increases in revenues generated by the company s deepwater class of vessels offset some of the revenue losses of the other vessel classes operating in the international segment 
revenues earned by the deepwater class of vessels increased approximately  or million during fiscal as compared to fiscal  despite decreases in utilization and average day rates  due to an increase in the number of deepwater vessels operating in the international market following the addition of newly built deepwater vessels to the fleet and to vessels transferring from the us gom market 
vessel revenues  utilization percentages and average day rates by vessel class for the international segment are disclosed in the vessel class revenues and statistics by segment section of this report 
operating profit for internationally based vessels decreased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to lower revenues from internationally based vessels  a million provision for venezuelan operations  as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  and approximately  or million  higher depreciation expense 
excluding the provision for venezuelan operations  the company s operating profit from internationally based vessels decreased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to lower revenues from internationally based vessels  which were partially offset by an approximate  or million  reduction in operating costs from internationally based vessels primarily crew costs  repair and maintenance and fuel  lube and supply costs 
depreciation expense associated with internationally based vessels increased during the comparative periods because of the transfer of vessels from the us gom to international markets and to newly constructed vessels that were added to the international fleet during fiscal and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements international crew costs were lower by approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  because of fewer vessels operating internationally as a result of vessels sales  stacking of vessels  and the seizing of vessels by the venezuelan government 
repair and maintenance costs for internationally based vessels decreased approximately  or million  because there were fewer drydockings performed during the same comparative periods 
fuel  lube and supply costs were lower by approximately  or million  during the same comparative periods  due to the same reasons listed above for lower crew costs 
international vessel operating lease costs increased approximately million  or  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  because of six additional vessel operating leases initiated during fiscal  as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
united states segment operations 
the company s united states results of operations are primarily dependent on the supply and demand relationship for natural gas in regards to shallow water activity and the supply and demand for crude oil in regards to deepwater activity 
the number of operating drilling rigs in the us offshore market is generally the primary driver of activity  and the us gom remained at historically low levels due to a reduction in exploration and field development activity in the us gom  particularly in non deepwater areas 
as a result of the deterioration of the macroeconomic environment in the us gom over the last few years and due to the global economic recession that began  during fiscal  the total us based vessel utilization decreased approximately percentage points as compared to fiscal vessel revenues from us based vessels decreased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to an approximate percentage point decrease in total us utilization rates  which reflected the deterioration in the macroeconomic environment in the us gom market during the comparative periods 
average day rates increased approximately during the same comparative time periods  but the increase in average day rates was insufficient to mitigate the negative effects that lower utilization rates had on us segment revenues 
higher average us day rates reflect a change in the mix of vessels operating during fiscal compared to fiscal as was the case with international operations  leading edge day rates in the us segment generally declined across vessel classes  however  the impact of this decline on average day rate statistics was mitigated by the company stacking traditional vessels 
vessel revenues also decreased during the comparative periods because of the transfer of approximately three vessels to international markets 
in response to the deteriorating us gom market conditions  the company stacked and removed from its active fleet vessels that could not find attractive charter hire contracts 
at the beginning of fiscal  the us gom had stacked vessels 
during fiscal  the company stacked additional vessels  sold five vessels from the previously stacked vessel fleet  and returned to domestic service one vessel  resulting in a total of us based stacked vessels as of march  the depressed utilization rates during fiscal are reflective of the reduced demand for vessels in the us gom and the stacking of additional vessels 
the company s deepwater class of vessels was responsible for approximately million  or  of the loss in revenue during fiscal as compared to fiscal  because three deepwater vessels required drydockings during fiscal average day rates on the deepwater class of vessels increased approximately  during the comparative periods because one deepwater vessel performed short term charter assignments periodically during fiscal at contract rates substantially higher than the otherwise average day rate 
the company s towing supply supply class of vessels were responsible for approximately  or million  of the loss in revenue during fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to an approximate percentage point decrease in utilization  an approximate decrease in average day rates resulting from the transfer of vessels to international markets  vessel sales and weak demand for the company s vessels in the shallow waters of the us gom market 
the company s crew utility class of vessels was responsible for approximately million  or  of the loss in revenue during the same comparative periods due to the transfer of crewboats to international markets 
vessel revenues  utilization percentages and average day rates by vessel class for the us segment are disclosed in the vessel class revenues and statistics by segment section of this report 
us based operating profit decreased approximately million  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to lower revenues 
reductions in revenues were somewhat offset by an approximate million  or  decrease in vessel operating costs primarily crew costs and repair and maintenance costs and an approximate million  or  decrease in depreciation expense resulting from fewer vessels

repair and maintenance costs were approximately  or million lower during fiscal as compared to fiscal because comparatively fewer drydocks were performed in fiscal versus fiscal and  because fewer vessels were operating in the us gom  comparatively lower expenditures were required for routine maintenance and repairs 
other items 
foreign exchange gains increased approximately million  or  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to an million  or per common share  foreign exchange gain related to the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar fuerte relative to us dollar 
excluding this gain  foreign exchange gains decreased approximately million  or  due to the devaluation of the us dollar relative to other currencies 
fiscal insurance and loss reserves were comparable to fiscal gain on asset dispositions  net  during fiscal increased approximately  or million  as compared to fiscal  due to higher gains earned on the mix of vessels sold 
dispositions of vessels can vary from quarter to quarter  therefore  gains on sales of assets may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
the company recorded impairment charges of million and million during fiscal and  respectively  on certain stacked vessels  which are included in gains on asset dispositions  net 
vessel class revenue and statistics by segment vessel utilization is determined primarily by market conditions and to a lesser extent by drydocking requirements 
vessel day rates are determined by the demand created largely through the level of offshore exploration  field development and production spending by energy companies relative to the supply of offshore service vessels 
suitability of equipment and the degree of service provided also influence vessel day rates 
vessel utilization rates are calculated by dividing the number of days a vessel works during a reporting period by the number of days the vessel is available to work in the reporting period 
average day rates are calculated by dividing the revenue a vessel earns during a reporting period by the number of days the vessel worked in the reporting period 
vessel utilization and average day rates are calculated only on vessels in service and  as such do not include vessels withdrawn from service four vessels at march  or joint venture vessels vessels at march

in addition  there were no borrowings outstanding under available credit facilities at march   and the full million of such credit facilities were available at march  currently the company is experiencing substantial delay with one fast  crew supply boat under construction in brazil that was originally scheduled to be delivered in september of on april   pursuant to the vessel construction contract  the company sent the subject shipyard a letter initiating arbitration in order to resolve disputes of such matters as the shipyard s failure to achieve payment milestones  its failure to follow the construction schedule  and its failure to timely deliver the vessel 
the company generally requires shipyards to provide third party credit support in the event that vessels are not completed and delivered in accordance with the terms of the shipbuilding contracts 
that third party credit support typically guarantees the return of amounts paid by the company  and generally takes the form of refundment guarantees or standby letters of credit issued by major financial institutions located in the country of the shipyard 
while the company seeks to minimize its shipyard credit risk by requiring these instruments  the ultimate return of amounts paid by the company in the event of shipyard default is still subject to the creditworthiness of the shipyard and the provider of the credit support  as well as the company s ability to successfully pursue legal action to compel payment of these instruments 
when third party credit support is not available or cost effective  the company endeavors to limit its credit risk through cash deposits and other contract terms with the shipyard and other counterparties

certain current and former subsidiaries of the company are  or were  participating employers in an industry wide multi employer retirement fund in the united kingdom  known as the merchant navy officers pension fund mnopf 
the company has been informed by the trustee of the mnopf that the fund has a deficit that will require contributions from the participating employers 
the amount and timing of the company s share of the fund s deficit depends on a number of factors  including updated calculations of the total fund deficit  theories of contribution imposed as determined by and within the scope of the trustee s authority  the number of then participating solvent employers  and the final formula adopted to allocate the required contribution among such participating employers 
the company recorded an additional liability of million and made payments totaling million into the fund during fiscal no additional liabilities were recorded during fiscal  and during fiscal  the company recorded a liability of million 
in the future  the fund s trustee may claim that the company owes additional amounts for various reasons  including negative fund investment returns in a depressed global market as reflected in a preliminary future actuarial valuation  or the inability of other assessed parties to contribute their share of respective allocations  failing which  the company and other solvent participating employers will be asked for additional contributions 
the company is in discussions with the fund s trustee about the trustee s recent unilateral decision to accelerate previously agreed installment payments and require the company to pay outstanding deficit contributions of million immediately 
the company has objected to that decision as there has been no change in circumstances since the last valuation that would justify the decision by the trustee to accelerate the installment payments previously permitted

on january   the arbitration tribunal  appointed under the icsid convention to resolve the investment dispute  held its first session on procedural issues in washington  dc the arbitration tribunal established an initial briefing and hearing schedule related to jurisdictional issues that extends through the spring of the company continues diligently to prosecute its claim in the arbitration 
while the company believes  after consultation with its advisors  that it is entitled to full reparation for the losses suffered as a result of the actions taken by the republic  there can be no assurances that the company will prevail in the arbitration 
on march   the company entered into a settlement and release with its marine insurers to resolve the claim the company had made under its marine insurance policy for the total loss of the vessels seized by venezuela 
under the settlement and release  the underwriters paid  subject to certain conditions  million the settlement payment in full and final settlement of the claim 
those conditions include a requirement that the company continue to prosecute its icsid arbitration claim and reimburse the underwriters the settlement payment less certain expenses if and when the company receives payment from venezuela 
under the settlement and release  the company continues to retain ownership of the claims in arbitration and the underwriters have waived any and all subrogation rights 
the settlement payment does not represent full reparation of the losses suffered by the company as a consequence of the expropriation of its investments in venezuela 
the million payment by the underwriters triggered an obligation by the company under the company s insurance program to pay an additional million in insurance premium to its underwriters and the company has paid that amount

in april  two brazilian subsidiaries of tidewater were notified by the customs office in macae  brazil that they were jointly and severally being assessed fines amounting to approximately million 
the assessment of these fines is for the alleged failure of these subsidiaries to obtain import licenses with respect to tidewater vessels that provided brazilian offshore vessel services to petrobras  the brazilian national oil company  over a three year period ending december tidewater and its brazilian subsidiaries believe  that vessels that provide services under contract to the brazilian offshore oil and gas industry are deemed  under applicable law and regulations  to be temporarily imported into brazil  and making the vessel owners exempt from obtaining import licenses for such vessels 
the macae customs office has now  without a change in the underlying law  taken the position that the temporary importation exemption is only available to new  and not used  goods imported into brazil and therefore it was improper for the company

application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the revenues recognized and expenses incurred during the reporting period 
the company evaluates the reasonableness of these estimates and assumptions continually based on a combination of historical information and other information that comes to its attention that may vary its outlook for the future 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
management suggests that the company s nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report  be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies that affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are described below 
revenue recognition the company s primary source of revenue is derived from time charter contracts of its vessels on a rate per day of service basis  therefore  vessel revenues are recognized on a daily basis throughout the contract period 
these time charter contracts are generally either on a term basis average three months to two years or on a spot basis 
the base rate of hire for a term contract is generally a fixed rate  provided  however  that term contracts at times include escalation clauses to recover increases in specific costs 
a spot contract is a short term agreement to provide offshore marine services to a customer for a specific short term job 
spot contract terms generally range from one day to three months 
vessel revenues are recognized on a daily basis throughout the contract period 
there are no material differences in the costs structure of the company s contracts based on whether the contracts are spot or term  for the operating costs are generally the same without regard to the length of a contract 
receivables in the normal course of business  the company extends credit to its customers on a short term basis 
the company s principal customers are major oil and natural gas exploration  field development and production companies 
the company routinely reviews and evaluates its accounts receivable balances for collectability 
when the company becomes aware of any uncollectible receivables  provisions for doubtful accounts is estimated and recorded  which reduces the company s receivable balance

goodwill the company tests goodwill for impairment annually at a reporting unit level  as required  utilizing carrying amounts as of december the company considers its reporting units to be its international and united states operations 
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is determined by discounting the projected future operating cash flows for the remaining average useful life of the assets within the reporting units by the company s estimated weighted average cost of capital 
impairment is deemed to exist if the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is less than the respective book value of the reporting unit goodwill  and in such case  an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the difference 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit  such as  future expected utilization and average day rates for the vessels  vessel additions and attrition  operating expenses and tax rates 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
the company performed its annual impairment test as of december   and the test determined there was no goodwill impairment 
at march   the company s goodwill balance represented of total assets and of stockholders equity 
interim testing will be performed if events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired 
examples of events or circumstances that might give rise to interim goodwill impairment testing include prolonged adverse industry or economic changes  significant business interruption due to political unrest or terrorism  unanticipated competition that has the potential to dramatically reduce the company s earning potential  legal issues  or the loss of key personnel 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable 
in such evaluation  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by an asset group are compared with the carrying amount of the asset group to determine if a write down may be required 
the company estimates cash flows based upon historical data adjusted for the company s best estimate of future market performance that is based on industry trends 
the company uses the discounted cash flow method to determine the estimated fair value of each asset group and compares such estimated fair value  considered level  as defined by financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  impairment or disposal of long lived assets  to the carrying value of each asset group in order to determine if impairment exists 
if impairment exists  the carrying value of the asset group is reduced to its estimated fair value 
with respect to vessels that have not been stacked  we group together for impairment testing purposes vessels with similar operating and marketing characteristics 
we also subdivide our groupings of assets with similar operating and marketing characteristics between our older vessels and newer vessels 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce materially different results 
management estimates may vary considerably from actual outcomes due to future adverse market conditions or poor operating results that could result in the inability to recover the current carrying value of an asset group  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
as the company s fleet continues to age  management closely monitors the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis to properly identify evolving trends and changes in market conditions that could impact the results of the impairment evaluation 
in addition to the periodic review of its active long lived assets for impairment when circumstances warrant  the company also performs a review of its stacked vessels and vessels withdrawn from service every six months 
this review considers items such as the vessel s age  length of time stacked and likelihood of a return to active service  among others 
the company records an impairment charge when the carrying value of a vessel withdrawn from service or stacked vessel that is unlikely to return to service exceeds its estimated fair value

index to financial statements income taxes the company determines its effective tax rate by estimating its permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the company is periodically audited by taxing authorities in the united states and by the respective tax agencies in the countries in which it operates internationally 
the tax audits generally include questions regarding the calculation of taxable income 
audit adjustments affecting permanent differences could have an impact on the company s effective tax rate 
the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets is based on the company s present belief that it is more likely than not that it will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to utilize such deferred tax assets  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record or adjust valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the need for changes to valuation allowances on a quarterly basis 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the present need for a valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
drydocking costs the company expenses maintenance and repair costs as incurred during the asset s original estimated useful life its original depreciable life 
major repair costs incurred after the original depreciable life that also have the effect of extending the useful life of the asset are capitalized and amortized over months 
major vessel modifications are capitalized and amortized over the remaining life of the equipment 
vessel modifications that are performed for a specific customer contract are capitalized and amortized over the firm contract term 
the majority of the company s vessels require a drydocking inspection twice in each five year period  and the company schedules these drydockings when it is anticipated that the work can be performed 
the company s net earnings can fluctuate quarter to quarter due to the timing of scheduled drydockings 
accrued property and liability losses the company self insures a portion of potential hull damage and personal injury claims that may arise in the normal course of business 
the company is exposed to insurance risks related to the company s reinsurance contracts with various insurance entities 
the reinsurance recoverable amount can vary depending on the size of a loss 
the exact amount of the reinsurance recoverable is not known until all losses are settled 
the company estimates the reinsurance recoverable amount it expects to receive and also estimates losses for claims that have occurred but have not been reported or not fully developed 
the company also monitors its reinsurance recoverable balances regularly for possible reinsurance exposure and makes adequate provisions for doubtful reinsurance receivables 
it is the company s opinion that its accounts and reinsurance receivables have no impairment other than that for which provisions have been made 
pension and other postretirement benefits the company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan and a supplemental executive retirement plan covering eligible employees of tidewater inc and participating subsidiaries 
the accounting for these plans is subject to guidance regarding employers accounting for pensions and employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
net periodic pension costs and accumulated benefit obligations are determined using a number of assumptions including the discount rates used to measure future obligations and expenses  the rate of compensation increases  retirement ages  mortality rates and expected long term return on plan assets  health care cost trends  and other assumptions  all of which have a significant impact on the amounts reported 
the company s pension cost consists of service costs  interest costs  expected returns on plan assets  amortization of prior service costs or benefits and  in part  on a market related valuation of assets 
the company considers a number of factors in developing its pension assumptions  including an evaluation of relevant discount rates  expected long term returns on plan assets  plan asset allocations  expected changes in

effects of inflation day to day operating costs are generally affected by inflation 
because the energy services industry requires specialized goods and services  general economic inflationary trends may not affect the company s operating costs 
the major impact on operating costs is the level of offshore exploration  field development and production spending by energy exploration and production companies 
as spending increases  prices of goods and services used by the energy industry and the energy services industry will increase 
future increases in vessel day rates may shield the company from the inflationary effects on operating costs 
the company s newer technologically sophisticated anchor handling towing supply vessels and platform supply vessels generally require a greater number of specially trained fleet personnel than the company s older smaller vessels 
competition for skilled crews may intensify  particularly in international markets  as new build vessels currently under construction enter the global fleet 
if competition for personnel intensifies  the market for experienced crews could exert upward pressure on wages  which would likely increase the company s crew costs 
strong fundamentals in the global energy industry experienced in the past few years have also increased the activity levels at shipyards worldwide  and until the calendar year global recession  the price of steel had increased dramatically due to increased worldwide demand for the metal 
the price of steel continues to be high by historical standards 
although prices eased with the reduced global demand for steel in recent years  availability of iron ore  the main component of steel  is tighter today than in when prices for iron ore increased dramatically 
steel consumption increased during calendar year and is expected to increase further during calendar because of an expectation of an economic recovery 
if the price of steel rises  the cost of new vessels will result in higher capital expenditures and depreciation expenses which will reduce the company s future operating profits  unless day rates increase commensurately 
environmental compliance during the ordinary course of business  the company s operations are subject to a wide variety of environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of oil and pollutants into navigable waters 
violations of these laws may result in civil and criminal penalties  fines  injunction and other sanctions 
compliance with the existing governmental regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has not had  nor is expected to have  a material effect on the company 
environmental laws and regulations are subject to change however  and may impose increasingly strict requirements and  as such  the company cannot estimate the ultimate cost of complying with such potential changes to environmental laws and regulations 
all vessels over feet in registered length  regardless of flag  that are operating as a means of transportation within the inland and offshore waters of the us but not beyond the three nautical mile territorial sea limit must comply with the environmental protection agency s national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes vessel general permit vgp for discharges incidental to the normal operation of vessels

foreign exchange risk the company s financial instruments that can be affected by foreign currency fluctuations and exchange risks consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables and trade payables denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company periodically enters into spot and forward derivative financial instruments as a hedge against foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  currency commitments  or to lock in desired interest rates 
spot derivative financial instruments are short term in nature and settle within two business days 
the fair value of spot derivatives approximates the carrying value due to the short term nature of this instrument  and as a result  no gains or losses are recognized 
forward derivative financial instruments are generally longer term in nature but generally do not exceed one year 
the accounting for gains or losses on forward contracts is dependent on the nature of the risk being hedged and the effectiveness of the hedge 
derivatives the company had eight purchase and one sell foreign exchange spot contracts outstanding at march   which totaled an aggregate notional value of million 
all nine spot contracts settled by april  the company had foreign exchange spot contracts outstanding at march   which totaled a notional value of million 
all spot contracts settled by april  at march   the company had three british pound forward contracts outstanding totaling million  which are generally intended to hedge the company s foreign exchange exposure relating to its merchant navy officers pension fund mnopf liability of million as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report and elsewhere in this document 
the forward contracts have expiration dates between september and june the combined change in fair value of these three forward contracts at march  was approximately million  all of which was recorded as a foreign exchange gain during the fiscal year ended march   because the forward contracts did not qualify as hedge instruments 
all changes in fair value of the forward contracts were recorded in earnings 
the company had no forward contracts outstanding at march  and other due to the company s international operations  the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and exchange rate risks on all charter hire contracts denominated in foreign currencies 
for some of our international contracts  a portion of the revenue and local expenses are incurred in local currencies with the result that the company is at risk of changes in the exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies 
we generally do not hedge against any foreign currency rate fluctuations associated with foreign currency contracts that arise in the normal course of business  which exposes us to the risk of exchange rate losses 
to minimize the financial impact of these items the company attempts to contract a significant majority of its services in us dollars 
in addition  the company attempts to minimize its financial impact of these risks  by matching the currency of the company s operating costs with the currency of the revenue streams when considered appropriate 
the company continually monitors the currency exchange risks associated with all contracts not denominated in us dollars 
discussions related to the company s currency risk associated with receivables generated by the venezuelan operations are disclosed in the liquidity  capital resources and other matters section of this report and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report
