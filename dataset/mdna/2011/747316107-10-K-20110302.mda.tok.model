our products  technical solutions and chemical management services cms enhance our customers processes  improve their product quality and lower their costs 
the growth in revenue during compared to was principally due to double digit volume increases experienced across the globe as the company continued to recover from the global economic downturn 
these volume increases were partially offset by lower cms revenue reported on a gross basis as a result of contract renegotiations

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates quaker s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon quaker s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires quaker to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  quaker evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer sales incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  property  plant  and equipment  investments  goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  restructuring  incentive compensation plans including equity based compensation  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
quaker bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
quaker believes the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements accounts receivable and inventory reserves and exposures quaker establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of quaker s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
as part of its terms of trade  quaker may custom manufacture products for certain large customers and or may ship product on a consignment basis 
further  a significant portion of quaker s revenues is derived from sales to customers in the us steel and automotive industries  where a number of bankruptcies have occurred during recent years and companies have experienced financial difficulties 
when a bankruptcy occurs  quaker must judge the amount of proceeds  if any  that may ultimately be received through the bankruptcy or liquidation process 
these matters may increase the company s exposure should a bankruptcy occur  and may require write down or disposal of certain inventory due to its estimated obsolescence or limited marketability 
reserves for customers filing for bankruptcy protection are generally dependent on the company s evaluation of likely proceeds from the bankruptcy process 
large and or financially distressed customers are generally reserved for on a specific review basis while a general reserve is established for other customers based on historical experience 
the company s consolidated allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
further  the company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
an increase of to the recorded provisions would have decreased the company s pre tax earnings by approximately million in  and  respectively 
environmental and litigation reserves accruals for environmental and litigation matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
accrued liabilities are exclusive of claims against third parties and are not discounted 
environmental costs and remediation costs are capitalized if the costs extend the life  increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of the property from the date acquired or constructed  and or mitigate or prevent contamination in the future 
estimates for accruals for environmental matters are based on a variety of potential technical solutions  governmental regulations and other factors  and are subject to a large range of potential costs for remediation and other actions 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in determining the most likely estimate within the range  and the factors determining this judgment may vary over time 
similarly  reserves for litigation and similar matters are based on a range of potential outcomes and require considerable judgment in determining the most probable outcome 
if no amount within the range is considered more probable than any other amount  the company accrues the lowest amount in the range in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements which appears in item of this report 
realizability of equity investments quaker holds equity investments in various foreign companies  whereby it has the ability to influence  but not control  the operations of the entity and its future results 
quaker 
table of contents records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions  poor operating results of underlying investments  or devaluation of foreign currencies could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value 
these factors may result in an impairment charge in the future 
the carrying amount of the company s equity investments at december  was million and was comprised of four investments totaling million in nippon quaker chemical  ltd 
japan at  million in tecniquimia mexicana sa de sa mexico at  million in kelko quaker chemical  sa venezuela at and million in kelko quaker chemical  sa panama at  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements which appears in item of this report 
tax exposures  valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions quaker records expenses and liabilities for taxes based on estimates of amounts that will be ultimately determined to be deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions 
the filed tax returns are subject to audit  often several years subsequent to the date of the financial statements 
disputes or disagreements may arise during audits over the timing or validity of certain items or deductions  which may not be resolved for extended periods of time 
quaker applies the provisions of fasb s guidance regarding uncertain tax positions 
the guidance applies to all income tax positions taken on previously filed tax returns or expected to be taken on a future tax return 
the guidance prescribes a benefit recognition model with a two step approach  a more likely than not recognition criterion  and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon effective settlement 
the guidance further requires that the amount of interest expense and income to be recognized related to uncertain tax positions be computed by applying the applicable statutory rate of interest to the difference between the tax position recognized in accordance with the guidance  including timing differences  and the amount previously taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
quaker also records valuation allowances when necessary to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while quaker has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event quaker were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should quaker determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made which could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial statements 
us income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries since it is the company s intention to continue to reinvest these earnings in those subsidiaries for working capital needs and growth initiatives 
us and foreign income taxes that would be payable if such earnings were distributed may be lower than the amount computed at the us statutory rate due to the availability of foreign tax credits 
restructuring liabilities restructuring charges may consist of charges for employee severance  rationalization of manufacturing facilities and other items 
the company applies fasb s guidance regarding exit or disposal cost obligations 
the guidance requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company records goodwill and intangible assets at fair value as of the acquisition date and amortizes intangible assets which do not have indefinite lives on a straight line basis over the lives of the intangible assets based on third party valuations of the assets 
goodwill and intangible assets  which have indefinite lives  are not amortized and are required to be assessed at least annually for impairment 
the company compares the assets fair value to their carrying value primarily based on future discounted cash flows in order to determine if an impairment charge is warranted 
the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance 
assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning 
the actual cash flows could differ from management s estimates due to changes in business conditions  operating performance  and economic conditions 
the company completed its annual impairment assessment as of the end 
table of contents of the third quarter  and no impairment charge was warranted 
the company s consolidated goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the company s assumption of weighted average cost of capital and estimated future net operating profit after tax nopat are particularly important in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred 
the company currently uses a weighted average cost of capital of and  at september   this assumption would have had to increase by more than percentage points before any of the company s reporting units would fail step one of the impairment analysis 
further  at september   the company s estimate of future nopat would have had to decrease by more than before any of the company s reporting units would be considered potentially impaired 
as a result  the estimated fair value of each of the company s reporting units substantially exceeds their carrying value 
postretirement benefits the company provides certain pension and other postretirement benefits to employees and retirees 
independent actuaries  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  perform the required valuations to determine benefit expense and  if necessary  non cash charges to equity for additional minimum pension liabilities 
critical assumptions used in the actuarial valuation include the weighted average discount rate  rates of increase in compensation levels  and expected long term rates of return on assets 
if different assumptions were used  additional pension expense or charges to equity might be required 
the company s us pension plan year end is november  and the measurement date is december the following table highlights the potential impact on the company s pre tax earnings due to changes in assumptions with respect to the company s pension plans  based on assets and liabilities at december  percentage point increase percentage point decrease foreign domestic total foreign domestic total dollars in millions discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets recently issued accounting standards the fasb updated its guidance regarding a vendor s multiple deliverable arrangements in october the updated guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy to be followed in determining the selling price for each deliverable in multiple deliverable arrangements  eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement using the relative selling price method and requires enhanced disclosure regarding multiple deliverable arrangements 
the guidance is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning after june  the company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance on its financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources quaker s cash and cash equivalents increased to million at december  from million at december  the million increase resulted primarily from million of cash provided by operating activities  million of cash used in investing activities  million of cash provided by financing activities and a million decrease from the effect of exchange rates on cash 
net cash flows provided by operating activities were million in  compared to million provided by operating activities in the company s improvement in net income was more than offset by increased investment in working capital 
during  the company experienced significantly lower business activity as it was still recovering from the global economic downturn  which in turn greatly reduced the company s investment in working capital 
as business volumes began to recover later in and continued to increase in  the company s need for working capital investment correspondingly increased 
the company s first quarter disposition of land in europe  reduced pension contributions compared to  and the completion of restructuring activities also impacted the operating cash flow comparisons 

table of contents net cash flows used in investing activities were million in  compared to million of cash used in investing activities in payments related to acquisitions were the primary driver in the change in cash flows used in investing activities 
during the third quarter of  the company completed the acquisition of da stuart s da aluminum hot rolling business from houghton international for million and  in the fourth quarter of  the company completed the acquisition of summit lubricants  inc for million 
cash paid for acquisitions in included the final million payment related to the acquisition of the remaining interest in the company s brazilian joint venture and the final payment related to the acquisition of the remaining minority interest in its china joint venture for approximately million 
in addition  the proceeds from the disposition of land in europe were offset by lower capital expenditures in as the company completed its middletown  ohio expansion project 
reductions in the use of restricted cash related to the expansion project also affected the investing cash flow comparisons 
in the first quarter of  an inactive subsidiary of the company reached a settlement agreement and release with one of its insurance carriers for million 
the proceeds of the settlement are restricted and can only be used to pay claims and costs of defense associated with this subsidiary s asbestos litigation 
the payments were structured to be received over a four year period with annual installments of million  the final installment of which was received in the first quarter of during the third quarter of  the same inactive subsidiary and another of its insurance carriers entered into a claim handling and funding agreement under which the carrier will pay of the defense and indemnity costs incurred by or on behalf of the subsidiary in connection with asbestos bodily injury claims for a minimum of five years beginning july  see notes   and of notes to consolidated financial statements which appear in item of this report 
net cash flows provided by financing activities were million in  compared to million of cash used in financing activities in the majority of the change was the result of debt repayments in compared to debt borrowings in in  the cash flow generated from reduced working capital investments as a result of significantly curtailed business volumes enabled the debt repayments 
in  debt borrowings were needed to supplement the company s cash flow from operations for its acquisition activity  noted above 
in addition  a significantly higher number of stock options were exercised in  which impacted the change in cash flows 
in june  the company amended its primary credit facility to increase the maximum principal amount available for revolving credit borrowings from million to million 
this amount can be increased to million at the company s option if the lenders agree to increase their commitments and the company satisfies certain conditions 
at december  and december   the company had approximately million and million  respectively  outstanding under its credit facilities 
the amendment also extended the maturity date of the company s credit line from august to june and amended certain acquisition and other covenants  including a reduced interest rate spread and a new interest rate tier for leverage ratios below one times ebitda that would allow for a further interest rate spread reduction 
the company s access to this credit is largely dependent on its consolidated leverage ratio covenant  which cannot exceed to  and at december  and december   the consolidated leverage ratio was below to under this covenant  the company could have borrowed an additional million at december  the company has entered into interest rate swaps with a combined notional value of million as of december   in order to fix the interest rate on a portion of its variable rate debt 
outstanding financial derivative instruments may expose the company to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements 
to manage credit risk  the company limits its exposure to any single counterparty 
however  the company does not expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations 
in  the company filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission the sec 
the registration statement was declared effective on january  and permits the company to offer and sell from time to time in one or more public offerings up to million aggregate dollar amount of its securities  which may be shares of preferred stock either separately or represented by depositary shares  common stock  debt securities and warrants to purchase our debt or equity securities  as well 
table of contents as units that include any of these securities  on terms  in each case  established at the time of the offering 
this registration statement provides the company with the ability to issue registered debt or equity securities on an accelerated basis 
at december   the company s gross liability for uncertain tax positions  including accrued interest and penalties  was million 
the company cannot determine a reliable estimate of the timing of cash flows by period related to its uncertain tax position liability 
however  should the entire liability be paid  the amount of the payment may be reduced by million as a result of offsetting benefits in other tax jurisdictions 
the company believes it is capable of supporting its operating requirements  including pension plan contributions  payments of dividends to shareholders  possible acquisitions and business opportunities  capital expenditures and possible resolution of contingencies through internally generated funds supplemented with debt or equity as needed 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
pension and other postretirement plan contributions beyond are not determinable since the amount of any contribution is heavily dependent on the future economic environment and investment returns on pension trust assets 
the timing of payments related to other long term liabilities  which consist primarily of deferred compensation agreements cannot be readily determined due to their uncertainty 
interest obligations on the company s short and long term debt are included assuming the debt levels will be outstanding for the entire period and assuming the interest rates in effect at december  interest obligations on the contingent acquisition consideration is included assuming the discount rate in effect at the time of acquisition 
payments due by period contractual obligations amounts in millions total and beyond short term debt long term debt capital lease obligations non cancelable operating leases purchase obligations pension and other postretirement plan contributions contingent acquisition consideration other long term liabilities see note of notes to consolidated financial statements total contractual cash obligations operations cms discussion the company currently has more than cms contracts in north america  as well as additional cms contracts in other areas of the world 
under its traditional cms approach  the company effectively acts as an agent  and the revenues and costs from these sales are reported on a net sales or pass through basis 
under certain of its cms contracts  the contracts are structured differently in that the company s revenue received from the customer is a fee for products and services provided to the customer  which are indirectly related to the actual costs incurred 
profit is dependent on how well the company controls product costs and achieves product conversions from other third party suppliers to its own products 
as a result  under the alternative structure  the 
table of contents company recognizes in reported revenue the gross revenue received from the cms site customer  and in cost of goods sold the third party product purchases  which substantially offset each other until the company achieves significant product conversions  which may result in a decrease in reported gross margin as a percentage of sales 
in  the company had a mix of contracts with both the traditional product pass through structure and fixed price contracts covering all services and products 
as a result of the global economic downturn and its impact in the automotive sector  during and early  the company experienced a shift in customer requirements and business circumstances where almost all of cms contracts have reverted to the traditional product pass through structure 
however  the company s offerings will continue to include both approaches to cms 
comparison of with net sales for were million  an increase of million  or approximately  compared to million in the increase in sales was driven by significant increases in volume across the globe  as the comparisons to the prior year continue to reflect recovery from the global economic downturn 
the volume increases were partially offset by lower cms revenue reported on a gross basis  which decreased revenues by approximately 
changes in price mix and foreign exchange rate translation each increased revenues by approximately 
gross profit increased million  or  compared to  largely as a result of increased volumes 
the gross margin increased to in from in raw material costs did not begin to significantly increase until the middle of the second quarter of and continued through the end of only a portion of these higher costs were recovered through price increases in additional price increases are being implemented in early as part of the company s effort to recover margins 
however  the reduction in gross margin from higher raw material costs was tempered by reduced automotive cms revenues reported on a gross basis which increased the gross margin by approximately percentage point 
sg a increased million  or  compared to higher selling costs with increased business activity  inflationary costs as well as increased incentive compensation were the primary drivers of the increase  representing of the increase 
differences in foreign exchange rates  higher professional fees related to acquisitions and other costs accounted for the remainder of the increase 
sg a as a percentage of sales decreased from in to in as initially disclosed in the company s second quarter form q  one of the company s subsidiaries may have paid certain value added taxes vat incorrectly and  in certain cases  may not have collected sufficient vat from certain customers 
the vat rules and regulations at issue are complex  vary among the jurisdictions and can be contradictory  in particular as to how they relate to the subsidiary s products and to sales between jurisdictions 
since its inception  the subsidiary had been consistent in its vat collection and remittance practices and had never been contacted by any tax authority relative to vat 
now the subsidiary has determined that for certain products  a portion of the vat was incorrectly paid and that the total vat due exceeds the amount originally collected and remitted by the subsidiary 
in  several jurisdictions contacted the subsidiary requesting information  but no tax assessments were received 
in two jurisdictions  the subsidiary has either participated in an amnesty program or entered into a settlement whereby it paid a reduced portion of the amounts owed in resolution of those jurisdictions claims 
at this time  the subsidiary has either modified or is in the process of modifying its vat invoicing and payment procedures to eliminate or mitigate future exposure 
in analyzing the subsidiary s exposure  it is difficult to estimate both the probability and the amount of any potential liabilities due to a number of factors  including the decrease in exposure over time due to applicable 
table of contents statutes of limitations and actions taken by the subsidiary  the joint liability of customers and suppliers for a portion of the vat  the availability of a vat refund for vat incorrectly paid through an administrative process  any amounts which may have already been  or will be paid by customers  as well as the timing and structure of any tax amnesties or settlements 
in addition  interest and penalties on any vat due can be a multiple of the base tax 
the subsidiary may contest any tax assessment administratively and or judicially for an extended period of time  but may ultimately resolve its disputes through participation in tax amnesty programs  which are a common practice for settling tax disputes in the jurisdictions in question and which have historically occurred on a regular basis resulting in significant reductions of interest and penalties 
also  the timing of payments and refunds of vat may not be contemporaneous  and  if additional vat is owed  it may not be fully recoverable from customers 
as a result  this matter has the potential to have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  liquidity and capital resources and the results of operations 
included in the results is a net charge of million  which consists of a net million charge related to two tax dispute settlements entered into by the subsidiary  as well as a net million charge representing management s best estimate  based on the information available to it  including the factors noted above  of the amount that ultimately may be paid related to the other jurisdiction that has made inquiries 
these charges assume a successful recovery of the vat incorrectly paid  as well as reductions in interest and penalties from anticipated future amnesty programs or settlements 
on a similar basis  if all other potentially impacted jurisdictions were to initiate audits and issue assessments  the range of the remaining exposure  net of refunds  could be from to million  with one jurisdiction representing approximately percent of this additional exposure  assuming the continued availability of future amnesty programs or settlements to reduce the interest and penalties 
if there are future assessments but no such future amnesty programs or settlements  the potential exposure could be higher 
in  the company implemented and completed a restructuring program totaling million  or approximately per diluted share 
the company incurred a final charge related to the former ceo s supplemental retirement plan of approximately million  or per diluted share  in  compared to a charge of million  or per diluted share  in other income for includes higher license fees from increased business activities as well as foreign exchange rate gains versus losses in  which partially offset a gain related to the disposition of land in europe of approximately per diluted share in net interest expense decreased due to lower interest rates  lower average debt balances as well as higher interest income 
the company s effective tax rate for was compared to in the effective tax rate includes a benefit of approximately per diluted share  while includes a benefit of approximately per diluted share  due to the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations for uncertain tax positions 
in addition  the effective tax rate was impacted by significantly improved profitability in certain higher rate jurisdictions  which has also allowed for the utilization of the domestic production activities deduction for the first time in the company s history 
the effective tax rate for reflects no tax provided for the land sale gain  due to the utilization of net operating losses  which were previously not benefited 
the company has experienced  and expects to experience  further volatility in its quarterly effective tax rates due to the varying timing of tax audits and the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations as they relate to uncertain tax positions 
during  the company recorded million of excess tax benefits in capital in excess of par on its consolidated balance sheet and in its consolidated statement of cash flows  related to stock option exercises  which occurred over the current and prior years 
previously  the company s actual taxable income in affected jurisdictions was not sufficient to recognize these benefits  while the company s taxable income was sufficient to recognize these benefits 
at the end of  the company had net us deferred tax assets totaling million  excluding deferred tax assets relating to additional minimum pension liabilities 
the company records valuation allowances when necessary to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
however  in the event the 
table of contents company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be a non cash charge to income in the period such determination was made  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial statements 
the global economic downturn has been negatively impacting profitability in certain taxing jurisdictions 
the company continues to closely monitor this situation as it relates to its net deferred tax assets and the assessment of valuation allowances 
the company is continuing to evaluate alternatives that could positively impact taxable income in these jurisdictions 
equity in net income of associated companies includes charges totaling approximately per diluted share related to the first quarter devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar fuerte and an out of period charge relating to errors the company identified for shortfalls in reserves for pensions and other items at the company s mexican affiliate 
the affiliate adjusted for these items in the fourth quarter of  and the company does not believe these adjustments are material to the company s consolidated financial statements for the years ended december    or and  therefore has not restated any prior period amounts 
the increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects improved profitability from these affiliates  as the prior year comparisons are affected by the global economic downturn 
segment reviews comparison of with metalworking process chemicals metalworking process chemicals consists of industrial process fluids for various heavy industrial and manufacturing applications and represented approximately of the company s net sales in net sales were up million  or  compared to foreign currency translation positively impacted net sales by approximately  driven by the brazilian real to us dollar exchange rate offset by the us euro to us dollar exchange rate 
the average us dollar to brazilian real exchange rate was in compared to in  while the average eu euro to eu dollar exchange rate was in compared to in net sales were positively impacted by increases of in north america  in europe  in asia pacific and in south america  all on a constant currency basis 
the increase in this segment s sales was primarily attributable to increased volumes of with double digit increases in all regions  as the prior year results continued to reflect the global economic downturn 
the product volume increases were partially offset by a reduction in automotive cms revenue  which was due  in part  to the renegotiation of certain contracts now reported on a pass through versus gross basis 
consistent with the significant volume increases  this segment s operating income increased million over coatings the company s coatings segment  which represented approximately of the company s net sales in  contains products that provide temporary and permanent coatings for metal and concrete products and chemical milling maskants 
net sales for this segment were up million  or for compared with the prior year  primarily due to higher encapsulant coatings sales 
this segment s operating income was up million  consistent with the noted volume increases 
other chemical products other chemical products  which represented less than of the company s net sales in  consists of sulfur removal products for industrial gas streams sold by the company s q technologies joint venture 
net sales were down million and operating income was at a slight loss due to reduced volumes with the downturn in the oil and gas markets 

table of contents comparison of with net sales for were million  a decline of million  or approximately  compared to million for volumes declined approximately  reflective of the global economic downturn 
changes in foreign exchange rates also decreased revenue by approximately 
gross profit decreased by million  or  compared to  reflective of the above noted volume declines which were tempered by gross margin expansion 
the gross margin increased to in  compared to in  primarily due to cost reduction actions taken  a more favorable raw material cost environment and reduced automotive chemical management services revenue reported on a gross basis 
sg a decreased million  or  compared to savings from cost reduction programs  lower travel and entertainment expenses and lower commissions  partially offset by higher incentive compensation accruals  accounted for of the decline 
changes in foreign exchange rates accounted for the remainder 
in response to the global economic downturn  the company initiated restructuring programs and incurred charges of approximately million  or approximately per diluted share in  and million  or approximately per diluted share in the company completed both initiatives in the company incurred charges related to the former ceo s supplemental retirement plan of approximately million in  or approximately per diluted share 
the ceo transition costs incurred in were approximately million  or approximately per diluted share 
other income for included a million gain related to the disposition of excess land in europe  while other income for included a net arbitration award of approximately million related to litigation with one of the former owners of the company s italian subsidiary 
lower foreign exchange rate losses in compared to also contributed to the change in other income in the increase in net interest expense was primarily due to lower interest income  as lower average debt balances were offset by higher interest rates 
the increase in equity in net income of associated companies and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was due to stronger financial performances from those affiliates as they began to recover from the global economic downturn 
the company s effective tax rate for was  compared to in the effective tax rate reflected no tax expense being provided for the land sale gain due to the utilization of net operating losses  which were previously not benefited  while the effective tax rate included a tax refund of million related to the company s increased investment in china 
segment reviews comparison of with metalworking process chemicals metalworking process chemicals consists of industrial process fluids for various heavy industrial and manufacturing applications and represented approximately of the company s net sales in net sales were down million  or  compared to foreign currency translation negatively impacted net sales by approximately  driven by the eu euro to eu dollar  and brazilian real to us dollar exchange rates 
the average euro to us dollar exchange rate was in compared to in  and the average brazilian real exchange rate was in compared to in net sales were negatively impacted by declines of in north america  in europe  in asia pacific and in south america  all on a constant currency basis 
the decline in this segment s sales was primarily attributable to volume declines of approximately impacting all regions  reflective of the global economic downturn 
part of this segment s volume decline was due to reduced automotive cms revenue reported on a gross versus pass through basis 
despite the significant volume declines  this segment s operating income increased million reflective of savings from the company s restructuring programs and reduced discretionary spending as well as a more favorable raw material environment 

table of contents coatings the company s coatings segment  which represented approximately of the company s net sales in  contains products that provide temporary and permanent coatings for metal and concrete products and chemical milling maskants 
net sales for this segment were down million  or  for compared with the prior year  primarily due to reduced volumes of chemical milling maskants sold to the aerospace industry as well as reduced coating sales to the construction industry 
this segment s operating income was down million  consistent with the volume decline noted above 
other chemical products other chemical products  which represented less than of the company s net sales in  consists of sulfur removal products for industrial gas streams sold by the company s q technologies joint venture 
net sales were down million as a result of reduced volumes due to the downturn in the oil and gas market 
operating income was a slight loss for  reflective of the above noted volume declines 
restructuring and related activities in the fourth quarter of  quaker s management approved restructuring plans the th quarter program to reduce operating costs  primarily in north america and europe 
included in restructuring plans were provisions for severance for employees 
the company recognized a million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of employee separation benefits varied depending on local regulations within certain foreign countries and included severance and other benefits

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quaker is exposed to the impact of interest rates  foreign currency fluctuations  changes in commodity prices  and credit risk 
interest rate risk 
quaker s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its short and long term debt 
most of quaker s debt is negotiated at market rates 
accordingly  if interest rates rise significantly  the cost of debt to quaker will increase 
this can have an adverse effect on quaker  depending on the extent of quaker s borrowings 
as of december   quaker had approximately million in borrowings under its credit facility at a weighted average borrowing rate of approximately libor plus a spread 
if interest rates were to change by  the company s interest expense would correspondingly increase or decrease approximately million 
the company uses derivative financial instruments primarily for the purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates 
the company does not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
the company has entered into interest rate swaps in order to fix a portion of its variable rate debt 
the swaps had a combined notional value of million and a fair value of million at december   and a combined notional value of million and a fair value of million at december  as of december   the company is currently receiving a libor rate and paying an additional average fixed rate of approximately on its interest rate swaps 
the company s remaining three swaps mature in the counterparties to the swaps are major financial institutions 
outstanding financial derivative instruments expose the company to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements 
to manage credit risk  the company limits its exposure to any single counterparty 
however  the company does not expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations 
see the information included under the caption derivatives in note and the information in note of notes to consolidated financial statements which appears in item of this report and is incorporated herein by reference 
foreign exchange risk 
a significant portion of quaker s revenues and earnings is generated by its foreign operations 
these foreign operations also represent a significant portion of quaker s assets and liabilities 
all such operations use the local currency as their functional currency 
accordingly  quaker s financial results are affected by risks typical of global business such as currency fluctuations  particularly between the us dollar  the brazilian real  the chinese renminbi and the eu euro 
as exchange rates vary  quaker s results can be materially affected 
if the brazilian real  the eu euro and the chinese renminbi were each to change by against the us dollar  the company s revenues and pre tax earnings would correspondingly have increased or decreased approximately million and million  respectively 
the company generally does not use financial instruments that expose it to significant risk involving foreign currency transactions  however  the size of non us activities has a significant impact on reported operating results and the attendant net assets 
during the past three years  sales by non us subsidiaries accounted for approximately to of consolidated net annual sales 
in addition  the company often sources inventory among its worldwide operations 
this practice can give rise to foreign exchange risk resulting from the varying cost of inventory to the receiving location  as well as from the revaluation of intercompany balances 
the company mitigates this risk through local sourcing efforts 
commodity price risk 
many of the raw materials used by quaker are commodity chemicals  and  therefore  quaker s earnings can be materially affected by market changes in raw material prices 
in certain cases  quaker has entered into fixed price purchase contracts having a term of up to two years 
these contracts provide for protection to quaker if the price for the contracted raw materials rises  however  in certain limited circumstances  quaker will not realize the benefit if such prices decline 
if the company s gross margin were to change by one percentage point  the company s pretax earnings would have correspondingly increased or decreased by approximately million 
credit risk 
quaker establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of quaker s customers were to 
table of contents deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
downturns in the overall economic climate may also exacerbate specific customer financial issues 
a significant portion of quaker s revenues is derived from sales to customers in the us steel and automotive industries  including some of our larger customers  where a number of bankruptcies occurred during recent years and companies have experienced financial difficulty 
when a bankruptcy occurs  quaker must judge the amount of proceeds  if any  that may ultimately be received through the bankruptcy or liquidation process 
in addition  as part of its terms of trade  quaker may custom manufacture products for certain large customers and or may ship product on a consignment basis 
these practices may increase the company s exposure should a bankruptcy occur  and may require write down or disposal of certain inventory due to its estimated obsolescence or limited marketability 
customer returns of products or disputes may also result in similar issues related to the realizability of recorded accounts receivable or returned inventory 
the company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
a change of to the recorded provisions would have increased or decreased the company s pre tax earnings by approximately million in  and  respectively
