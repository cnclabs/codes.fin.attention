item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note  segment results  in notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
sales and distribution practices in each of our reportable segments are as set forth below 
global batteries appliances we manage our global batteries appliances sales force by geographic region and product group 
our sales team is divided into three major geographic territories  north america  latin america and europe and the rest of the world europe row 
within each major geographic territory  we have additional subdivisions designed to meet our customers needs 
we manage our sales force in north america by distribution channel

in addition  we utilize a network of independent brokers to service participants in selected distribution channels 
we manage our sales force in latin america by distribution channel and geographic territory 
we sell primarily to large retailers  wholesalers  distributors  food and drug chains and retail outlets 
in countries where we do not maintain a sales force  we sell to distributors who market our products through all channels in the market 
the sales force serving our customers in europe row is supplemented by an international network of distributors to promote the sale of our products 
our sales operations throughout europe row are organized by geographic territory and the following sales channels i food retail  which includes mass merchandisers  discounters and drug and food stores  ii specialty trade  which includes clubs  consumer electronics stores  department stores  photography stores and wholesalers distributors  and iii industrial  government  hearing aid professionals and oems 
global pet supplies our global pet supplies sales force is aligned by customer  geographic region and product group 
we sell pet supply products to mass merchandisers  grocery and drug chains  pet superstores  independent pet stores and other retailers 

table of contents home and garden business the sales force of the home and garden business is aligned by customer 
we sell primarily to home improvement centers  mass merchandisers  hardware stores  home and garden distributors  and food and drug retailers in the us manufacturing  raw materials and suppliers the principal raw materials used in manufacturing our products zinc powder  electrolytic manganese dioxide powder and steel are sourced either on a global or regional basis 
the prices of these raw materials are susceptible to price fluctuations due to supply and demand trends  energy costs  transportation costs  government regulations and tariffs  changes in currency exchange rates  price controls  general economic conditions and other unforeseen circumstances 
we have regularly engaged in forward purchase and hedging derivative transactions in an attempt to effectively manage the raw material costs we expect to incur over the next to months 
substantially all of our rechargeable batteries and chargers  portable lighting products  hair care and other personal care products and our electric shaving and grooming products and small appliances are manufactured by third party suppliers that are primarily located in the asia pacific region 
we maintain ownership of most of the tooling and molds used by our suppliers 
we continually evaluate our manufacturing facilities capacity and related utilization 
as a result of such analyses  we have closed a number of manufacturing facilities during the past five years 
in general  we believe our existing facilities are adequate for our present and foreseeable needs 
research and development our research and development strategy is focused on new product development and performance enhancements of our existing products 
we plan to continue to use our strong brand names  established customer relationships and significant research and development efforts to introduce innovative products that offer enhanced value to consumers through new designs and improved functionality 
in our fiscal years ended september   and  we invested million  million and million  respectively  in product research and development 
patents and trademarks we own or license from third parties a significant number of patents and patent applications throughout the world relating to products we sell and manufacturing equipment we use 
we hold a license that expires in march for certain alkaline battery designs  technology and manufacturing equipment from matsushita electrical industrial co  ltd 
matsushita  to whom we pay a royalty 
we also use and maintain a number of trademarks in our business  including dingo  jungletalk  marineland  rayovac  remington  tetra  varta  in  cutter  hot shot  garden safe  nature s miracle  repel  spectracide  spectracide terminate  george foreman  russell hobbs and black decker 
we seek trademark protection in the us and in foreign countries by all available means  including registration 
as a result of the october sale by varta ag of substantially all of its consumer battery business to us and varta ag s subsequent sale of its automotive battery business to johnson controls  inc johnson controls  we acquired rights to the varta trademark in the consumer battery category and johnson controls acquired rights to the trademark in the automotive battery category 
varta ag continues to have rights to use the trademark with travel guides and industrial batteries and varta microbattery gmbh has the right to use the trade mark with micro batteries 
we are party to a trademark and domain names protection and delimitation agreement that governs ownership and usage rights and obligations of the parties relative to the varta trademark 

table of contents as a result of the common origins of the remington products  llc remington products business we acquired in september and the remington arms company  inc remington arms  the remington trademark is owned by us and by remington arms each with respect to its principal products as well as associated products 
accordingly  we own the rights to use the remington trademark for electric shavers  shaver accessories  grooming products and personal care products  while remington arms owns the rights to use the trademark for firearms  sporting goods and products for industrial use  including industrial hand tools 
in addition  the terms of a agreement between remington products and remington arms provides for the shared rights to use the remington trademark on products which are not considered principal products of interest for either company 
we retain the remington trademark for nearly all products which we believe can benefit from the use of the brand name in our distribution channels 
we license the black decker brand in north america  latin america excluding brazil and the caribbean for four core categories of household appliances beverage products  food preparation products  garment care products and cooking products 
russell hobbs has licensed the black decker brand since for use in marketing various household small appliances 
in july  russell hobbs and the black decker corporation bdc extended the trademark license agreement for a fourth time through december under the agreement as extended  russell hobbs agreed to pay bdc royalties based on a percentage of sales  with minimum annual royalty payments of million from calendar year through calendar year the agreement also requires us to comply with maximum annual return rates for products 
if bdc does not agree to renew the license agreement  we have months to transition out of the brand name 
no minimum royalty payments will be due during such transition period 
bdc has agreed not to compete in the four core product categories for a period of five years after the termination of the license agreement 
upon request  bdc may elect to extend the license to use the black decker brand to certain additional product categories 
bdc has approved several extensions of the license to additional categories and geographies 
competition in our retail markets  we compete for limited shelf space and consumer acceptance 
factors influencing product sales include brand name recognition  perceived quality  price  performance  product packaging  design innovation  and consumer confidence and preferences as well as creative marketing  promotion and distribution strategies 
the battery product category is highly competitive 
most consumer batteries manufactured throughout the world are sold by one of four global companies spectrum brands manufacturer seller of rayovac and varta brands  energizer holdings  inc energizer manufacturer seller of the energizer brand  the procter gamble company procter gamble manufacturer seller of the duracell brand  and matsushita manufacturer seller of the panasonic brand 
we also face competition from the private label brands of major retailers  particularly in europe 
the offering of private label batteries by retailers may create pricing pressure in the consumer battery market 
typically  private label brands are not supported by advertising or promotion  and retailers sell these private label offerings at prices below competing name brands 
the main barriers to entry for new competitors are investment in technology research  cost of building manufacturing capacity and the expense of building retail distribution channels and consumer brands 
in the us alkaline battery category  the rayovac brand is positioned as a value brand  which is typically defined as a product that offers comparable performance at a lower price 
in europe  the varta brand is competitively priced with other premium brands 
in latin america  where zinc carbon batteries outsell alkaline batteries  the rayovac brand is competitively priced 
the pet supply product category is highly fragmented with over manufacturers in the us alone  consisting primarily of small companies with limited product lines 
our largest competitors in this product category are mars corporation mars  the hartz mountain corporation hartz and central garden pet company central garden pet 
both hartz and central garden pet sell a comprehensive line of pet supplies and compete with a majority of the products we offer 
mars sells primarily aquatics products 

table of contents products we sell in the home and garden product category through the home and garden business face competition from the scotts miracle gro company scotts company  which markets home and garden products under the scotts  ortho  roundup and miracle gro brand names  central garden pet  which markets garden products under the amdro and sevin brand names  and bayer ag  which markets home and garden products under the bayer advanced brand name 
products we sell in the household insect control product category through the home and garden business face competition from sc johnson son  inc sc johnson  which markets insecticide and repellent products under the raid and off brands  scotts company  which markets household insect control products under the ortho brand  and henkel kgaa  which markets insect control products under the combat brand 
our primary competitors in the electric shaving and grooming product category are norelco  a division of koninklijke philips electronics nv philips  which sells and markets rotary shavers  and braun  a division of procter gamble  which sells and markets foil shavers 
through our remington brand  we sell both foil and rotary shavers 
primary competitive brands in the small appliance category include hamilton beach  proctor silex  sunbeam  mr 
coffee  oster  general electric  rowenta  delonghi  kitchen aid  cuisinart  krups  braun  rival  europro  kenwood  philips  morphy richards  breville and tefal 
the key competitors of russell hobbs in this market in the us and canada include jarden corporation  delonghi america  euro pro operating llc  metro thebe  inc  d b a hwi breville  nacco industries  inc 
hamilton beach and seb sa in addition  russell hobbs competes with retailers who use their own private label brands for household appliances for example  wal mart 
our major competitors in the electric personal care product category are conair corporation  wahl clipper corporation and helen of troy limited helen of troy 
our primary competitors in the portable lighting product category are energizer and mag instrument  inc some of our major competitors have greater resources and greater overall market share than we do 
they have committed significant resources to protect their market shares or to capture market share from us and may continue to do so in the future 
in some key product lines  our competitors may have lower production costs and higher profit margins than we do  which may enable them to compete more aggressively in advertising and in offering retail discounts and other promotional incentives to retailers  distributors  wholesalers and  ultimately  consumers 
seasonality on a consolidated basis our financial results are approximately equally weighted between quarters  however  sales of certain product categories tend to be seasonal 
sales in the consumer battery  electric shaving and grooming and electric personal care product categories  particularly in north america  tend to be concentrated in the december holiday season spectrum s first fiscal quarter 
demand for pet supplies products remains fairly constant throughout the year 
demand for home and garden control products sold though the home and garden business typically peaks during the first six months of the calendar year spectrum s second and third fiscal quarters 
small appliances peaks from july through december primarily due to the increased demand by customers in the late summer for back to school sales and in the fall for the holiday season 
for a more detailed discussion of the seasonality of our product sales  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonal product sales 
governmental regulations and environmental matters due to the nature of our operations  our facilities are subject to a broad range of federal  state  local and foreign legal and regulatory provisions relating to the environment  including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes and the 
table of contents remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances at our facilities 
we believe that compliance with the federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations to which we are subject will not have a material effect upon our capital expenditures  financial condition  earnings or competitive position 
from time to time  we have been required to address the effect of historic activities on the environmental condition of our properties 
we have not conducted invasive testing at all facilities to identify all potential environmental liability risks 
given the age of our facilities and the nature of our operations  it is possible that material liabilities may arise in the future in connection with our current or former facilities 
if previously unknown contamination of property underlying or in the vicinity of our manufacturing facilities is discovered  we could incur material unforeseen expenses  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  capital expenditures  earnings and competitive position 
although we are currently engaged in investigative or remedial projects at some of our facilities  we do not expect that such projects  taking into account established accruals  will cause us to incur expenditures that are material to our business  financial condition or results of operations  however  it is possible that our future liability could be material 
we have been  and in the future may be  subject to proceedings related to our disposal of industrial and hazardous material at off site disposal locations or similar disposals made by other parties for which we are held responsible as a result of our relationships with such other parties 
in the us  these proceedings are under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla or similar state laws that hold persons who arranged for the disposal or treatment of such substances strictly liable for costs incurred in responding to the release or threatened release of hazardous substances from such sites  regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original disposal 
liability under cercla is typically joint and several  meaning that a liable party may be responsible for all costs incurred in investigating and remediating contamination at a site 
as a practical matter  liability at cercla sites is shared by all of the viable responsible parties 
we occasionally are identified by federal or state governmental agencies as being a potentially responsible party for response actions contemplated at an off site facility 
at the existing sites where we have been notified of our status as a potentially responsible party  it is either premature to determine whether our potential liability  if any  will be material or we do not believe that our liability  if any  will be material 
we may be named as a potentially responsible party under cercla or similar state laws for other sites not currently known to us  and the costs and liabilities associated with these sites may be material 
it is difficult to quantify with certainty the potential financial impact of actions regarding expenditures for environmental matters  particularly remediation  and future capital expenditures for environmental control equipment 
nevertheless  based upon the information currently available  we believe that our ultimate liability arising from such environmental matters  taking into account established accruals of million for estimated liabilities at september  should not be material to our business or financial condition 
electronic and electrical products that we sell in europe  particularly products sold under the remington brand name  varta battery chargers  certain portable lighting and all of our batteries  are subject to regulation in european union eu markets under three key eu directives 
the first directive is the restriction of the use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment rohs which took effect in eu member states beginning july  rohs prohibits companies from selling products which contain certain specified hazardous materials in eu member states 
we believe that compliance with rohs will not have a material effect on our capital expenditures  financial condition  earnings or competitive position 
the second directive is entitled the waste of electrical and electronic equipment weee 
weee makes producers or importers of particular classes of electrical goods financially responsible for specified collection  recycling  treatment and disposal of past and future covered products 
weee assigns levels of responsibility to companies doing business in eu markets based on their relative market share 
weee calls on each eu member state to enact enabling legislation to implement the directive 
to comply with weee requirements  we have partnered with other companies to create a comprehensive collection  treatment  disposal and recycling program 
as eu member states pass enabling legislation we currently expect our compliance system to be sufficient to meet such requirements 
our current estimated costs associated with compliance with weee are not significant based on our current market share 
however  we continue to evaluate the impact of the weee legislation as eu member states implement 
table of contents guidance and as our market share changes and  as a result  actual costs to our company could differ from our current estimates and may be material to our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the third directive is the directive on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries  which was adopted in september and went into effect in september the battery directive 
the battery directive bans heavy metals in batteries by establishing maximum quantities of those heavy metals in batteries and mandates waste management of batteries  including collection  recycling and disposal systems 
the battery directive places the costs of such waste management systems on producers and importers of batteries 
the battery directive calls on each eu member state to enact enabling legislation to implement the directive 
we currently believe that compliance with the battery directive will not have a material effect on our capital expenditures  financial condition  earnings or competitive position 
however  until such time as the eu member states adopt enabling legislation  a full evaluation of these costs cannot be completed 
we will continue to evaluate the impact of the battery directive and its enabling legislation as eu member states implement guidance 
certain of our products and facilities in each of our business segments are regulated by the united states environmental protection agency the epa and the united states food and drug administration the fda or other federal consumer protection and product safety agencies and are subject to the regulations such agencies enforce  as well as by similar state  foreign and multinational agencies and regulations 
for example  in the us  all products containing pesticides must be registered with the epa and  in many cases  similar state and foreign agencies before they can be manufactured or sold 
our inability to obtain or the cancellation of any registration could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the severity of the effect would depend on which products were involved  whether another product could be substituted and whether our competitors were similarly affected 
we attempt to anticipate regulatory developments and maintain registrations of  and access to  substitute chemicals and other ingredients 
we may not always be able to avoid or minimize these risks 
the food quality protection act fqpa established a standard for food use pesticides  which is that a reasonable certainty of no harm will result from the cumulative effect of pesticide exposures 
under the fqpa  the epa is evaluating the cumulative effects from dietary and non dietary exposures to pesticides 
the pesticides in certain of our products continue to be evaluated by the epa as part of this program 
it is possible that the epa or a third party active ingredient registrant may decide that a pesticide we use in our products will be limited or made unavailable to us 
we cannot predict the outcome or the severity of the effect of the epa s continuing evaluations of active ingredients used in our products 
certain of our products and packaging materials are subject to regulations administered by the fda 
among other things  the fda enforces statutory prohibitions against misbranded and adulterated products  establishes ingredients and manufacturing procedures for certain products  establishes standards of identity for certain products  determines the safety of products and establishes labeling standards and requirements 
in addition  various states regulate these products by enforcing federal and state standards of identity for selected products  grading products  inspecting production facilities and imposing their own labeling requirements 
employees we had approximately  full time employees worldwide as of september  approximately of our total labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements 
there are five collective bargaining agreements that will expire during our fiscal year ending september   which cover approximately of the labor force under collective bargaining agreements  or approximately of our total labor force 
we believe that our overall relationship with our employees is good

table of contents item a 
risk factors forward looking statements we have made or implied certain forward looking statements in this annual report on form k 
all statements  other than statements of historical facts included in this annual report  including the statements under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regarding our business strategy  future operations  financial condition  estimated revenues  projected costs  projected synergies  prospects  plans and objectives of management  as well as information concerning expected actions of third parties  are forward looking statements 
when used in this annual report  the words anticipate  intend  plan  estimate  believe  expect  project  could  will  should  may and similar expressions are also intended to identify forward looking statements  although not all forward looking statements contain such identifying words 
since these forward looking statements are based upon our current expectations of future events and projections and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control and some of which may change rapidly  actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those expressed or implied herein  and you should not place undue reliance on these statements 
important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied herein include  without limitation the impact of our substantial indebtedness on our business  financial condition and results of operations  the impact of restrictions in our debt instruments on our ability to operate our business  finance our capital needs or pursue or expand business strategies  any failure to comply with financial covenants and other provisions and restrictions of our debt instruments  our ability to successfully integrate the business acquired in connection with the combination with russell hobbs and achieve the expected synergies from that integration at the expected costs  the impact of expenses resulting from the implementation of new business strategies  divestitures or current and proposed restructuring activities  the impact of fluctuations in commodity prices  costs or availability of raw materials or terms and conditions available from suppliers  including suppliers willingness to advance credit  interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations  the loss of  or a significant reduction in  sales to a significant retail customer s  competitive promotional activity or spending by competitors or price reductions by competitors  the introduction of new product features or technological developments by competitors and or the development of new competitors or competitive brands  the effects of general economic conditions  including inflation  recession or fears of a recession  depression or fears of a depression  labor costs and stock market volatility or changes in trade  monetary or fiscal policies in the countries where we do business  changes in consumer spending preferences and demand for our products  our ability to develop and successfully introduce new products  protect our intellectual property and avoid infringing the intellectual property of third parties  our ability to successfully implement  achieve and sustain manufacturing and distribution cost efficiencies and improvements  and fully realize anticipated cost savings  the cost and effect of unanticipated legal  tax or regulatory proceedings or new laws or regulations including environmental  public health and consumer protection regulations  
table of contents public perception regarding the safety of our products  including the potential for environmental liabilities  product liability claims  litigation and other claims  the impact of pending or threatened litigation  changes in accounting policies applicable to our business  government regulations  the seasonal nature of sales of certain of our products  the effects of climate change and unusual weather activity  and the effects of political or economic conditions  terrorist attacks  acts of war or other unrest in international markets 
some of the above mentioned factors are described in further detail in the section entitled risk factors set forth below 
you should assume the information appearing in this annual report on form k is accurate only as of september  or as otherwise specified  as our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects may have changed since that date 
except as required by applicable law  including the securities laws of the us and the rules and regulations of the sec  we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise to reflect actual results or changes in factors or assumptions affecting such forward looking statements 

table of contents risk factors any of the following factors could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations and the risks described below are not the only risks that we may face 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently view as immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
risks related to the merger we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the merger 
the merger involved the integration of two companies that previously operated independently 
the integration of our operations with those of russell hobbs is expected to result in financial and operational benefits  including increased revenues and cost savings 
there can be no assurance  however  regarding when or the extent to which we will be able to realize these increased revenues  cost savings or other benefits 
integration may also be difficult  unpredictable  and subject to delay because of possible company culture conflicts and different opinions on technical decisions and product roadmaps 
we must integrate or  in some cases  replace  numerous systems  including those involving management information  purchasing  accounting and finance  sales  billing  employee benefits  payroll and regulatory compliance  many of which are dissimilar 
in some instances  we and russell hobbs have served the same customers  and some customers may decide that it is desirable to have additional or different suppliers 
difficulties associated with integration could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
integrating our business with that of russell hobbs may divert our management s attention away from operations 
successful integration of our and russell hobbs operations  products and personnel may place a significant burden on our management and other internal resources 
the diversion of management s attention  and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process  could harm our business  financial conditions and operating results 
risks related to our emergence from bankruptcy because our consolidated financial statements are required to reflect fresh start reporting adjustments to be made upon emergence from bankruptcy  financial information in our financial statements prepared after august  will not be comparable to our financial information from prior periods 
all conditions required for the adoption of fresh start reporting were met upon emergence from chapter of the bankruptcy code on the effective date 
however  in light of the proximity of that date to our accounting period close immediately following the effective date  which was august   we elected to adopt a convenience date of august  for recording fresh start reporting 
we adopted fresh start reporting in accordance with the accounting standards codification asc topic reorganizations  pursuant to which our reorganization value  which is intended to reflect the fair value of the entity before considering liabilities and approximate the amount a willing buyer would pay for the assets of the entity immediately after the reorganization  was allocated to the fair value of assets in conformity with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  using the purchase method of accounting for business combinations 
we stated liabilities  other than deferred taxes  at a present value of amounts expected to be paid 
the amount remaining after allocation of the reorganization value to the fair value of identified tangible and intangible assets was reflected as goodwill  which is subject to periodic evaluation for impairment 
in addition  under fresh start reporting the accumulated deficit was eliminated 
thus  the data derived from our consolidated statements of financial position and operations as of dates and for the periods after august  will not be comparable in many respects to that derived from the consolidated statements of financial position and operations as of dates and for periods prior to the adoption of fresh start reporting 
the lack of comparable historical information may discourage investors from purchasing our securities 
additionally  the financial information included in this annual report on form k may not be indicative of future financial information 

table of contents risks related to our business we are a parent company and our primary source of cash is and will be distributions from our subsidiaries 
we are a parent company with limited business operations of our own 
our main asset is the capital stock of our subsidiaries 
we conduct most of our business operations through our direct and indirect subsidiaries 
accordingly  our primary sources of cash are dividends and distributions with respect to our ownership interests in our subsidiaries that are derived from their earnings and cash flow 
our subsidiaries might not generate sufficient earnings and cash flow to pay dividends or distributions in the future 
our subsidiaries payments to us will be contingent upon their earnings and upon other business considerations 
in addition  our senior credit facilities  the indentures governing our notes and other agreements limit or prohibit certain payments of dividends or other distributions to us 
we expect that future credit facilities will contain similar restrictions 
our substantial indebtedness may limit our financial and operating flexibility  and we may incur additional debt  which could increase the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness 
we have  and we expect to continue to have  a significant amount of indebtedness 
as of september   we had total indebtedness under our senior secured facilities  the notes and other debt of approximately billion 
our substantial indebtedness has had  and could continue to have  material adverse consequences for our business  and may require us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness  which will reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  research and development expenditures and other business activities  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  restrict our ability to make strategic acquisitions  dispositions or to exploit business opportunities  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and limit our ability to borrow additional funds even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity or dispose of assets 
under the senior secured facilities and the indenture governing the notes the indenture  we may incur additional indebtedness 
if new debt is added to our existing debt levels  the related risks that we now face would increase 
furthermore  a substantial portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates 
if market interest rates increase  the interest rate on our variable rate debt will increase and will create higher debt service requirements  which would adversely affect our cash flow and could adversely impact our results of operations 
while we may enter into agreements limiting our exposure to higher debt service requirements  any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk 
restrictive covenants in the senior secured facilities and the indenture may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies 
the senior secured facilities and the indenture each restrict  among other things  asset dispositions  mergers and acquisitions  dividends  stock repurchases and redemptions  other restricted payments  indebtedness and preferred stock  loans and investments  liens and affiliate transactions 
the senior secured facilities and the indenture also contain customary events of default 
these covenants  among other things  limit our ability to fund future working capital and capital expenditures  engage in future acquisitions or development activities  or otherwise realize the value of our assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a portion of 
table of contents cash flow from operations to payments on debt 
in addition  the senior secured facilities contain financial covenants relating to maximum leverage and minimum interest coverage 
such covenants could limit the flexibility of our restricted entities in planning for  or reacting to  changes in the industries in which they operate 
our ability to comply with these covenants is subject to certain events outside of our control 
if we are unable to comply with these covenants  the lenders under our senior secured facilities or notes could terminate their commitments and the lenders under our senior secured facilities or notes could accelerate repayment of our outstanding borrowings and  in either case  we may be unable to obtain adequate refinancing of outstanding borrowings on favorable terms 
if we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due  the lenders under the senior secured facilities or notes will also have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the indebtedness owed to them 
if our obligations under the senior secured facilities and the notes are accelerated  we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full such indebtedness 
the sale or other disposition by harbinger group inc  the holder of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock  to non affiliates of a sufficient amount of the common stock of sb holdings would constitute a change of control under the agreements governing spectrum brands debt 
harbinger group inc hrg owns a majority of the outstanding shares of the common stock of sb holdings 
the sale or other disposition by hrg to non affiliates of a sufficient amount of the common stock of sb holdings could constitute a change of control under the agreements governing spectrum brands debt  including any foreclosure on or sale of sb holdings common stock pledged as collateral by hrg pursuant to the indenture governing hrg s senior secured notes due under the term loan and the abl revolving credit facility  a change of control is an event of default and  if a change of control were to occur  spectrum brands would be required to get an amendment to these agreements to avoid a default 
if spectrum brands was unable to get such an amendment  the lenders could accelerate the maturity of each of the spectrum brands term loan and the abl revolving credit facility 
in addition  under the indentures governing the notes and the notes  upon a change of control of sb holdings  spectrum brands is required to offer to repurchase such notes from the holders at a price equal to of principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest or obtain a waiver of default from the holders of such notes 
if spectrum brands was unable to make the change of control offer  or to obtain a waiver of default  it would be an event of default under the indentures that could allow holders of such notes to accelerate the maturity of the notes 
see risks related to sb holdings common stock the harbinger parties and hrg will exercise significant influence over us and their interests in our business may be different from the interests of our stockholders 
we face risks related to the current economic environment 
the current economic environment and related turmoil in the global financial system has had and may continue to have an impact on our business and financial condition 
global economic conditions have significantly impacted economic markets within certain sectors  with financial services and retail businesses being particularly impacted 
our ability to generate revenue depends significantly on discretionary consumer spending 
it is difficult to predict new general economic conditions that could impact consumer and customer demand for our products or our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers  suppliers and creditors 
the recent continuation of a number of negative economic factors  including constraints on the supply of credit to households  uncertainty and weakness in the labor market and general consumer fears of a continuing economic downturn could have a negative impact on discretionary consumer spending 
if the economy continues to deteriorate or fails to improve  our business could be negatively impacted  including as a result of reduced demand for our products or supplier or customer disruptions 
any weakness in discretionary consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when it could be necessary or beneficial to do so  which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions 
in  concern over sovereign debt in greece  ireland and certain other european union countries caused significant fluctuations of the euro relative to other currencies  such as the us dollar 
destabilization of the 
table of contents european economy could lead to a decrease in consumer confidence  which could cause reductions in discretionary spending and demand for our products 
furthermore  sovereign debt issues could also lead to further significant  and potentially longer term  economic issues such as reduced economic growth and devaluation of the euro against the us dollar  any of which could adversely affect our business  financial conditions and operating results 
we may not be able to retain key personnel or recruit additional qualified personnel whether as a result of the merger or otherwise  which could materially affect our business and require us to incur substantial additional costs to recruit replacement personnel 
we are highly dependent on the continuing efforts of our senior management team and other key personnel 
as a result of the merger  our current and prospective employees could experience uncertainty about their future roles 
this uncertainty may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key management  sales  marketing and technical personnel 
any failure to attract and retain key personnel  whether as a result of the merger or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  we currently do not maintain key person insurance covering any member of our management team 
we participate in very competitive markets and we may not be able to compete successfully  causing us to lose market share and sales 
the markets in which we participate are very competitive 
in the consumer battery market  our primary competitors are duracell a brand of procter gamble  energizer and panasonic a brand of matsushita 
in the electric shaving and grooming and electric personal care product markets  our primary competitors are braun a brand of procter gamble  norelco a brand of philips  and vidal sassoon and revlon brands of helen of troy 
in the pet supplies market  our primary competitors are mars  hartz and central garden pet 
in the home and garden business  our principal national competitors are scotts  central garden pet and sc johnson 
our principal national competitors within our small appliances segment include jarden corporation  delonghi america  euro pro operating llc  metro thebe  inc  d b a hwi breville  nacco industries  inc hamilton beach and seb sa in each of these markets  we also face competition from numerous other companies 
in addition  in a number of our product lines  we compete with our retail customers  who use their own private label brands  and with distributors and foreign manufacturers of unbranded products 
significant new competitors or increased competition from existing competitors may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of our operations 
we compete with our competitors for consumer acceptance and limited shelf space based upon brand name recognition  perceived product quality  price  performance  product features and enhancements  product packaging and design innovation  as well as creative marketing  promotion and distribution strategies  and new product introductions 
our ability to compete in these consumer product markets may be adversely affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the following we compete against many well established companies that may have substantially greater financial and other resources  including personnel and research and development  and greater overall market share than us 
in some key product lines  our competitors may have lower production costs and higher profit margins than us  which may enable them to compete more aggressively in offering retail discounts  rebates and other promotional incentives 
product improvements or effective advertising campaigns by competitors may weaken consumer demand for our products 
consumer purchasing behavior may shift to distribution channels where we do not have a strong presence 
consumer preferences may change to lower margin products or products other than those we market 

table of contents we may not be successful in the introduction  marketing and manufacture of any new products or product innovations or be able to develop and introduce  in a timely manner  innovations to our existing products that satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance 
some competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower profit margins to compete with us 
as a result of this competition  we could lose market share and sales  or be forced to reduce our prices to meet competition 
if our product offerings are unable to compete successfully  our sales  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we may not be able to realize expected benefits and synergies from future acquisitions of businesses or product lines 
we may acquire partial or full ownership in businesses or may acquire rights to market and distribute particular products or lines of products 
the acquisition of a business or the rights to market specific products or use specific product names may involve a financial commitment by us  either in the form of cash or equity consideration 
in the case of a new license  such commitments are usually in the form of prepaid royalties and future minimum royalty payments 
there is no guarantee that we will acquire businesses or product distribution rights that will contribute positively to our earnings 
anticipated synergies may not materialize  cost savings may be less than expected  sales of products may not meet expectations  and acquired businesses may carry unexpected liabilities 
sales of certain of our products are seasonal and may cause our operating results and working capital requirements to fluctuate 
on a consolidated basis our financial results are approximately equally weighted between quarters  however  sales of certain product categories tend to be seasonal 
sales in the consumer battery  electric shaving and grooming and electric personal care product categories  particularly in north america  tend to be concentrated in the december holiday season spectrum s first fiscal quarter 
demand for pet supplies products remains fairly constant throughout the year 
demand for home and garden control products sold though the home and garden business typically peaks during the first six months of the calendar year spectrum s second and third fiscal quarters 
small appliances peaks from july through december primarily due to the increased demand by customers in the late summer for back to school sales and in the fall for the holiday season 
as a result of this seasonality  our inventory and working capital needs fluctuate significantly during the year 
in addition  orders from retailers are often made late in the period preceding the applicable peak season  making forecasting of production schedules and inventory purchases difficult 
if we are unable to accurately forecast and prepare for customer orders or our working capital needs  or there is a general downturn in business or economic conditions during these periods  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we are subject to significant international business risks that could hurt our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate 
approximately of our net sales for the fiscal year ended september  were from customers outside of the us our pursuit of international growth opportunities may require significant investments for an extended period before returns on these investments  if any  are realized 
our international operations are subject to risks including  among others currency fluctuations  including  without limitation  fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate of the euro  changes in the economic conditions or consumer preferences or demand for our products in these markets  the risk that because our brand names may not be locally recognized  we must spend significant amounts of time and money to build brand recognition without certainty that we will be successful  
table of contents labor unrest  political and economic instability  as a result of terrorist attacks  natural disasters or otherwise  lack of developed infrastructure  longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts  restrictions on transfers of funds  import and export duties and quotas  as well as general transportation costs  changes in domestic and international customs and tariffs  changes in foreign labor laws and regulations affecting our ability to hire and retain employees  inadequate protection of intellectual property in foreign countries  unexpected changes in regulatory environments  difficulty in complying with foreign law  difficulty in obtaining distribution and support  and adverse tax consequences 
the foregoing factors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase or maintain our supply of products  financial condition or results of operations 
adverse weather conditions during our peak selling season for our home and garden control products could have a material adverse effect on our home and garden business 
weather conditions in the us have a significant impact on the timing and volume of sales of certain of our lawn and garden and household insecticide and repellent products 
periods of dry  hot weather can decrease insecticide sales  while periods of cold and wet weather can slow sales of herbicides 
our products utilize certain key raw materials  any increase in the price of  or change in supply and demand for  these raw materials could have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition and profits 
the principal raw materials used to produce our products including zinc powder  electrolytic manganese dioxide powder  petroleum based plastic materials  steel  aluminum  copper and corrugated materials for packaging are sourced either on a global or regional basis by us or our suppliers  and the prices of those raw materials are susceptible to price fluctuations due to supply and demand trends  energy costs  transportation costs  government regulations  duties and tariffs  changes in currency exchange rates  price controls  general economic conditions and other unforeseen circumstances 
in particular  during and  and to date in  we experienced extraordinary price increases for raw materials  particularly as a result of strong demand from china 
although we may increase the prices of certain of our goods to our customers  we may not be able to pass all of these cost increases on to our customers 
as a result  our margins may be adversely impacted by such cost increases 
we cannot provide any assurance that our sources of supply will not be interrupted due to changes in worldwide supply of or demand for raw materials or other events that interrupt material flow  which may have an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations 
we regularly engage in forward purchase and hedging derivative transactions in an attempt to effectively manage and stabilize some of the raw material costs we expect to incur over the next to months  however  our hedging positions may not be effective  or may not anticipate beneficial trends  in a particular raw material market or may  as a result of changes in our business  no longer be useful for us 
in addition  for certain of the principal raw materials we use to produce our products  such as electrolytic manganese dioxide powder  there are 
table of contents no available effective hedging markets 
if these efforts are not effective or expose us to above average costs for an extended period of time  and we are unable to pass our raw materials costs on to our customers  our future profitability may be materially and adversely affected 
furthermore  with respect to transportation costs  certain modes of delivery are subject to fuel surcharges which are determined based upon the current cost of diesel fuel in relation to pre established agreed upon costs 
we may be unable to pass these fuel surcharges on to our customers  which may have an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations 
in addition  we have exclusivity arrangements and minimum purchase requirements with certain of our suppliers for the home and garden business  which increase our dependence upon and exposure to those suppliers 
some of those agreements include caps on the price we pay for our supplies and in certain instances  these caps have allowed us to purchase materials at below market prices 
when we attempt to renew those contracts  the other parties to the contracts may not be willing to include or may limit the effect of those caps and could even attempt to impose above market prices in an effort to make up for any below market prices paid by us prior to the renewal of the agreement 
any failure to timely obtain suitable supplies at competitive prices could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to fully utilize our us net operating loss carryforwards 
as of september   spectrum brands has us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  million and  million  respectively 
these net operating loss carryforwards expire through years ending in as of september   our management determined that it continues to be more likely than not that the us net deferred tax asset  excluding certain indefinite lived assets  will not be realized in the future and as such recorded a full valuation allowance to offset the net us deferred tax asset  including spectrum brands net operating loss carryforwards 
in addition  spectrum brands has had changes of ownership  as defined under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the irc  that continue to subject a significant amount of spectrum brands us net operating losses and other tax attributes to certain limitations 
as a consequence of the salton applica merger  as well as earlier business combinations and issuances of common stock consummated by both companies  use of the tax benefits of russell hobbs us loss carryforwards is also subject to limitations imposed by section of the irc 
we expect that a significant portion of these carryforwards will not be available to offset future taxable income  if any 
in addition  use of russell hobbs net operating loss and credit carryforwards is dependent upon both russell hobbs and us achieving profitable results in the future 
the russell hobbs us net operating loss carryforwards are subject to a full valuation allowance at september  we estimate that approximately million of the spectrum and russell hobbs us federal net operating losses and million of the spectrum and russell hobbs state net operating losses would expire unused even if the company generates sufficient income to otherwise use all its net operating losses  due to the limitation in section of the irc 
if we are unable to fully utilize our net operating losses  other than those restricted under section of the irc  as discussed above  to offset taxable income generated in the future  our results of operations could be materially and negatively impacted 
consolidation of retailers and our dependence on a small number of key customers for a significant percentage of our sales may negatively affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a result of consolidation of retailers and consumer trends toward national mass merchandisers  a significant percentage of our sales are attributable to a very limited group of customers 
our largest customer accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal year ended september  as these mass merchandisers and retailers grow larger and become more sophisticated  they may demand lower pricing  special packaging  or impose other requirements on product suppliers 
these business demands may 
table of contents relate to inventory practices  logistics  or other aspects of the customer supplier relationship 
because of the importance of these key customers  demands for price reductions or promotions  reductions in their purchases  changes in their financial condition or loss of their accounts could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although we have long established relationships with many of our customers  we do not have long term agreements with them and purchases are generally made through the use of individual purchase orders 
any significant reduction in purchases  failure to obtain anticipated orders or delays or cancellations of orders by any of these major customers  or significant pressure to reduce prices from any of these major customers  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  a significant deterioration in the financial condition of the retail industry in general could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
in addition  as a result of the desire of retailers to more closely manage inventory levels  there is a growing trend among them to purchase products on a just in time basis 
due to a number of factors  including i manufacturing lead times  ii seasonal purchasing patterns and iii the potential for material price increases  we may be required to shorten our lead time for production and more closely anticipate our retailers and customers demands  which could in the future require us to carry additional inventories and increase our working capital and related financing requirements 
this may increase the cost of warehousing inventory or result in excess inventory becoming difficult to manage  unusable or obsolete 
in addition  if our retailers significantly change their inventory management strategies  we may encounter difficulties in filling customer orders or in liquidating excess inventories  or may find that customers are cancelling orders or returning products  which may have a material adverse effect on our business 
furthermore  we primarily sell branded products and a move by one or more of our large customers to sell significant quantities of private label products  which we do not produce on their behalf and which directly compete with our products  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a result of our international operations  we face a number of risks related to exchange rates and foreign currencies 
our international sales and certain of our expenses are transacted in foreign currencies 
during the fiscal year ended september   approximately of our net sales and of our operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies 
we expect that the amount of our revenues and expenses transacted in foreign currencies will increase as our latin american  european and asian operations grow and  as a result  our exposure to risks associated with foreign currencies could increase accordingly 
significant changes in the value of the us dollar in relation to foreign currencies will affect our cost of goods sold and our operating margins and could result in exchange losses or otherwise have a material effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in currency exchange rates may also affect our sales to  purchases from and loans to our subsidiaries as well as sales to  purchases from and bank lines of credit with our customers  suppliers and creditors that are denominated in foreign currencies 
we source many products from china and other asian countries 
to the extent the chinese renminbi rmb or other currencies appreciate with respect to the us dollar  we may experience fluctuations in our results of operations 
since  the rmb has no longer been pegged to the us dollar at a constant exchange rate and instead fluctuates versus a basket of currencies 
although the people s bank of china regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant short term fluctuations in the exchange rate  the rmb may appreciate or depreciate within a flexible peg range against the us dollar in the medium to long term 
moreover  it is possible that in the future chinese authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the rmb exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market 

table of contents while we may enter into hedging transactions in the future  the availability and effectiveness of these transactions may be limited  and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations 
further  we may not be successful in implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations and  thus  our results of operations may be adversely impacted 
a deterioration in trade relations with china could lead to a substantial increase in tariffs imposed on goods of chinese origin  which potentially could reduce demand for and sales of our products 
we purchase a number of our products and supplies from suppliers located in china 
china gained permanent normal trade relations pntr with the us when it acceded to the world trade organization wto  effective january the us imposes the lowest applicable tariffs on exports from pntr countries to the us in order to maintain its wto membership  china has agreed to several requirements  including the elimination of caps on foreign ownership of chinese companies  lowering tariffs and publicizing its laws 
china may not meet these requirements and  as a result  it may not remain a member of the wto  and its pntr trading status may not be maintained 
if china s wto membership is withdrawn or if pntr status for goods produced in china were removed  there could be a substantial increase in tariffs imposed on goods of chinese origin entering the us which could have a material negative adverse effect on our sales and gross margin 
furthermore  on october   the us senate approved a bill to impose sanctions against china for its currency valuation  although the future status of this bill is uncertain 
if this bill is enacted into law  the us government may impose duties on products from china and other countries found to be subsidizing their exports by undervaluing their currencies  which may increase the costs of goods produced in china  or prompt china to retaliate with other tariffs or other actions 
any such series of events could have a material negative adverse effect on our sales and gross margin 
our international operations may expose us to risks related to compliance with the laws and regulations of foreign countries 
we are subject to three eu directives that may have a material impact on our business restriction of the use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment  waste of electrical and electronic equipment and the directive on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries  discussed below 
restriction of the use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment requires us to eliminate specified hazardous materials from products we sell in eu member states 
waste of electrical and electronic equipment requires us to collect and treat  dispose of or recycle certain products we manufacture or import into the eu at our own expense 
the eu directive on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries bans heavy metals in batteries by establishing maximum quantities of heavy metals in batteries and mandates waste management of these batteries  including collection  recycling and disposal systems  with the costs imposed upon producers and importers such as us 
the costs associated with maintaining compliance or failing to comply with the eu directives may harm our business 
for example although contracts with our suppliers address related compliance issues  we may be unable to procure appropriate restriction of the use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment compliant material in sufficient quantity and quality and or be able to incorporate it into our product procurement processes without compromising quality and or harming our cost structure 
we may face excess and obsolete inventory risk related to non compliant inventory that we may continue to hold in fiscal for which there is reduced demand  and we may need to write down the carrying value of such inventories 
we may be unable to sell certain existing inventories of our batteries in europe 
many of the developing countries in which we operate do not have significant governmental regulation relating to environmental safety  occupational safety  employment practices or other business matters routinely regulated in the us or may not rigorously enforce such regulation 
as these countries and their economies develop  it is possible that new regulations or increased enforcement of existing regulations may increase the expense of doing 
table of contents business in these countries 
in addition  social legislation in many countries in which we operate may result in significantly higher expenses associated with labor costs  terminating employees or distributors and closing manufacturing facilities 
increases in our costs as a result of increased regulation  legislation or enforcement could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may not be able to adequately establish and protect our intellectual property rights  and the infringement or loss of our intellectual property rights could harm our business 
to establish and protect our intellectual property rights  we rely upon a combination of national  foreign and multi national patent  trademark and trade secret laws  together with licenses  confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements 
the measures that we take to protect our intellectual property rights may prove inadequate to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property 
we may need to resort to litigation to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights 
if a competitor or collaborator files a patent application claiming technology also claimed by us  or a trademark application claiming a trademark  service mark or trade dress also used by us  in order to protect our rights  we may have to participate in expensive and time consuming opposition or interference proceedings before the us patent and trademark office or a similar foreign agency 
similarly  our intellectual property rights may be challenged by third parties or invalidated through administrative process or litigation 
the costs associated with protecting intellectual property rights  including litigation costs  may be material 
for example  our small appliances segment has spent several million dollars on protecting its patented automatic litter box business over the last few years 
furthermore  even if our intellectual property rights are not directly challenged  disputes among third parties could lead to the weakening or invalidation of our intellectual property rights  or our competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
obtaining  protecting and defending intellectual property rights can be time consuming and expensive  and may require us to incur substantial costs  including the diversion of the time and resources of management and technical personnel 
moreover  the laws of certain foreign countries in which we operate or may operate in the future do not protect  and the governments of certain foreign countries do not enforce  intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws and government of the us  which may negate our competitive or technological advantages in such markets 
also  some of the technology underlying our products is the subject of nonexclusive licenses from third parties 
as a result  this technology could be made available to our competitors at any time 
if we are unable to establish and then adequately protect our intellectual property rights  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we license various trademarks  trade names and patents from third parties for certain of our products 
these licenses generally place marketing obligations on us and require us to pay fees and royalties based on net sales or profits 
typically  these licenses may be terminated if we fail to satisfy certain minimum sales obligations or if we breach the terms of the license 
the termination of these licensing arrangements could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in our global batteries appliances segment  we license the use of the black decker brand for marketing in certain small household appliances in north america  south america excluding brazil and the caribbean 
sales of black decker branded products represented approximately of the total consolidated revenue in fiscal in july  bdc extended the license agreement through december the failure to renew the license agreement with bdc or to enter into a new agreement on acceptable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
claims by third parties that we are infringing their intellectual property and other litigation could adversely affect our business 
from time to time in the past we have been subject to claims that we are infringing the intellectual property of others 
we currently are the subject of such claims and it is possible that third parties will assert infringement claims against us in the future 
an adverse finding against us in these or similar trademark or other intellectual 
table of contents property litigations may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming and expensive  and may require us to incur substantial costs  including the diversion of the resources of management and technical personnel  cause product delays or require us to enter into licensing or other agreements in order to secure continued access to necessary or desirable intellectual property 
if we are deemed to be infringing a third party s intellectual property and are unable to continue using that intellectual property as we had been  our business and results of operations could be harmed if we are unable to successfully develop non infringing alternative intellectual property on a timely basis or license non infringing alternatives or substitutes  if any exist  on commercially reasonable terms 
in addition  an unfavorable ruling in intellectual property litigation could subject us to significant liability  as well as require us to cease developing  manufacturing or selling the affected products or using the affected processes or trademarks 
any significant restriction on our proprietary or licensed intellectual property that impedes our ability to develop and commercialize our products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our dependence on a few suppliers and one of our us facilities for certain of our products makes us vulnerable to a disruption in the supply of our products 
although we have long standing relationships with many of our suppliers  we generally do not have long term contracts with them 
an adverse change in any of the following could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations our ability to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers  the terms and conditions upon which we purchase products from our suppliers  including applicable exchange rates  transport costs and other costs  our suppliers willingness to extend credit to us to finance our inventory purchases and other factors beyond our control  the financial condition of our suppliers  political instability in the countries in which our suppliers are located  our ability to import outsourced products  our suppliers noncompliance with applicable laws  trade restrictions and tariffs  or our suppliers ability to manufacture and deliver outsourced products according to our standards of quality on a timely and efficient basis 
if our relationship with one of our key suppliers is adversely affected  we may not be able to quickly or effectively replace such supplier and may not be able to retrieve tooling  molds or other specialized production equipment or processes used by such supplier in the manufacture of our products 
in addition  we manufacture the majority of our foil cutting systems for our shaving product lines  using specially designed machines and proprietary cutting technology  at our portage  wisconsin facility 
damage to this facility  or prolonged interruption in the operations of this facility for repairs  as a result of labor difficulties or for other reasons  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture and sell our foil shaving products which could in turn harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face risks related to our sales of products obtained from third party suppliers 
we sell a significant number of products that are manufactured by third party suppliers over which we have no direct control 
while we have implemented processes and procedures to try to ensure that the suppliers we use are complying with all applicable regulations  there can be no assurances that such suppliers in all instances will comply with such processes and procedures or otherwise with applicable regulations 
noncompliance could result in our marketing and distribution of contaminated  defective or dangerous products which could subject us 
table of contents to liabilities and could result in the imposition by governmental authorities of procedures or penalties that could restrict or eliminate our ability to purchase products from non compliant suppliers 
any or all of these effects could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
class action and derivative action lawsuits and other investigations  regardless of their merits  could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we and certain of our officers and directors have been named in the past  and may be named in the future  as defendants of class action and derivative action lawsuits 
in the past  we have also received requests for information from government authorities 
regardless of their subject matter or merits  class action lawsuits and other government investigations may result in significant cost to us  which may not be covered by insurance  may divert the attention of management or may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be exposed to significant product liability claims which our insurance may not cover and which could harm our reputation 
in the ordinary course of our business  we may be named as a defendant in lawsuits involving product liability claims 
in any such proceeding  plaintiffs may seek to recover large and sometimes unspecified amounts of damages and the matters may remain unresolved for several years 
any such matters could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to successfully defend against or settle these matters or if our insurance coverage is insufficient to satisfy any judgments against us or settlements relating to these matters 
although we have product liability insurance coverage and an excess umbrella policy  our insurance policies may not provide coverage for certain  or any  claims against us or may not be sufficient to cover all possible liabilities 
additionally  we do not maintain product recall insurance 
we may not be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms  if at all  in the future 
moreover  any adverse publicity arising from claims made against us  even if the claims were not successful  could adversely affect the reputation and sales of our products 
in particular  product recalls or product liability claims challenging the safety of our products may result in a decline in sales for a particular product 
this could be true even if the claims themselves are ultimately settled for immaterial amounts 
this type of adverse publicity could occur and product liability claims could be made in the future 
we may incur material capital and other costs due to environmental liabilities 
we are subject to a broad range of federal  state  local  foreign and multi national laws and regulations relating to the environment 
these include laws and regulations that govern discharges to the air  water and land  the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes  and remediation of contamination associated with release of hazardous substances at our facilities and at off site disposal locations 
risk of environmental liability is inherent in our business 
as a result  material environmental costs may arise in the future 
in particular  we may incur capital and other costs to comply with increasingly stringent environmental laws and enforcement policies  such as the eu directives restriction of the use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment  waste of electrical and electronic equipment and the directive on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries  discussed above 
moreover  there are proposed international accords and treaties  as well as federal  state and local laws and regulations  that would attempt to control or limit the causes of climate change  including the effect of greenhouse gas emissions on the environment 
in the event that the us government or foreign governments enact new climate change laws or regulations or make changes to existing laws or regulations  compliance with applicable laws or regulations may 
table of contents result in increased manufacturing costs for our products  such as by requiring investment in new pollution control equipment or changing the ways in which certain of our products are made 
we may incur some of these costs directly and others may be passed on to us from our third party suppliers 
although we believe that we are substantially in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at our facilities  we may not always be in compliance with such laws and regulations or any new laws and regulations in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time  we have been required to address the effect of historic activities on the environmental condition of our properties or former properties 
we have not conducted invasive testing at all of our facilities to identify all potential environmental liability risks 
given the age of our facilities and the nature of our operations  material liabilities may arise in the future in connection with our current or former facilities 
if previously unknown contamination of property underlying or in the vicinity of our manufacturing facilities is discovered  we could be required to incur material unforeseen expenses 
if this occurs  it may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are currently engaged in investigative or remedial projects at a few of our facilities and any liabilities arising from such investigative or remedial projects at such facilities may have a material effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are also subject to proceedings related to our disposal of industrial and hazardous material at off site disposal locations or similar disposals made by other parties for which we are responsible as a result of our relationship with such other parties 
these proceedings are under cercla or similar state or foreign jurisdiction laws that hold persons who arranged for the disposal or treatment of such substances strictly liable for costs incurred in responding to the release or threatened release of hazardous substances from such sites  regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original disposal 
liability under cercla is typically joint and several  meaning that a liable party may be responsible for all of the costs incurred in investigating and remediating contamination at a site 
we occasionally are identified by federal or state governmental agencies as being a potentially responsible party for response actions contemplated at an off site facility 
at the existing sites where we have been notified of our status as a potentially responsible party  it is either premature to determine if our potential liability  if any  will be material or we do not believe that our liability  if any  will be material 
we may be named as a potentially responsible party under cercla or similar state or foreign jurisdiction laws in the future for other sites not currently known to us  and the costs and liabilities associated with these sites may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
compliance with various public health  consumer protection and other regulations applicable to our products and facilities could increase our cost of doing business and expose us to additional requirements with which we may be unable to comply 
certain of our products sold through  and facilities operated under  each of our business segments are regulated by the epa  the fda or other federal consumer protection and product safety agencies and are subject to the regulations such agencies enforce  as well as by similar state  foreign and multinational agencies and regulations 
for example  in the us  all products containing pesticides must be registered with the epa and  in many cases  similar state and foreign agencies before they can be manufactured or sold 
our inability to obtain  or the cancellation of  any registration could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the severity of the effect would depend on which products were involved  whether another product could be substituted and whether our competitors were similarly affected 
we attempt to anticipate regulatory developments and maintain registrations of  and access to  substitute chemicals and other ingredients  but we may not always be able to avoid or minimize these risks 
as a distributor of consumer products in the us  certain of our products are also subject to the consumer product safety act  which empowers the us consumer product safety commission the consumer commission to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous 
under certain circumstances  the consumer commission could require us to repair  replace or refund the purchase price of one or more of our products  or we may voluntarily do so 
for example  russell hobbs  in cooperation with the consumer commission  voluntarily recalled approximately  units of a thermal coffeemaker sold under the 
table of contents black decker brand in august and approximately  coffeemakers in june any additional repurchases or recalls of our products could be costly to us and could damage the reputation or the value of our brands 
if we are required to remove  or we voluntarily remove our products from the market  our reputation or brands could be tarnished and we may have large quantities of finished products that could not be sold 
furthermore  failure to timely notify the consumer commission of a potential safety hazard can result in significant fines being assessed against us 
additionally  laws regulating certain consumer products exist in some states  as well as in other countries in which we sell our products  and more restrictive laws and regulations may be adopted in the future 
the fqpa established a standard for food use pesticides  which is that a reasonable certainty of no harm will result from the cumulative effect of pesticide exposures 
under the fqpa  the epa is evaluating the cumulative effects from dietary and non dietary exposures to pesticides 
the pesticides in certain of our products that are sold through the home and garden business continue to be evaluated by the epa as part of this program 
it is possible that the epa or a third party active ingredient registrant may decide that a pesticide we use in our products will be limited or made unavailable to us 
we cannot predict the outcome or the severity of the effect of the epa s continuing evaluations of active ingredients used in our products 
in addition  the use of certain pesticide products that are sold through our home and garden business may  among other things  be regulated by various local  state  federal and foreign environmental and public health agencies 
these regulations may require that only certified or professional users apply the product  that users post notices on properties where products have been or will be applied or that certain ingredients may not be used 
compliance with such public health regulations could increase our cost of doing business and expose us to additional requirements with which we may be unable to comply 
any failure to comply with these laws or regulations  or the terms of applicable environmental permits  could result in us incurring substantial costs  including fines  penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions or the prohibition of sales of our pest control products 
environmental law requirements  and the enforcement thereof  change frequently  have tended to become more stringent over time and could require us to incur significant expenses 
most federal  state and local authorities require certification by underwriters laboratory  inc ul  an independent  not for profit corporation engaged in the testing of products for compliance with certain public safety standards  or other safety regulation certification prior to marketing electrical appliances 
foreign jurisdictions also have regulatory authorities overseeing the safety of consumer products 
our products may not meet the specifications required by these authorities 
a determination that any of our products are not in compliance with these rules and regulations could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants 
public perceptions that some of the products we produce and market are not safe could adversely affect us 
on occasion  customers and some current or former employees have alleged that some products failed to perform up to expectations or have caused damage or injury to individuals or property 
public perception that any of our products are not safe  whether justified or not  could impair our reputation  damage our brand names and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to negotiate satisfactory terms to continue existing or enter into additional collective bargaining agreements  we may experience an increased risk of labor disruptions and our results of operations and financial condition may suffer 
approximately of our total labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements 
there are five collective bargaining agreements that will expire during our fiscal year ending september   which cover approximately of the labor force under collective bargaining agreements  or approximately of our total 
table of contents labor force 
while we currently expect to negotiate continuations to the terms of these agreements  there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain terms that are satisfactory to us or otherwise to reach agreement at all with the applicable parties 
in addition  in the course of our business  we may also become subject to additional collective bargaining agreements 
these agreements may be on terms that are less favorable than those under our current collective bargaining agreements 
increased exposure to collective bargaining agreements  whether on terms more or less favorable than our existing collective bargaining agreements  could adversely affect the operation of our business  including through increased labor expenses 
while we intend to comply with all collective bargaining agreements to which we are subject  there can be no assurances that we will be able to do so and any noncompliance could subject us to disruptions in our operations and materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets  discount rates and other factors could affect our results of operations  equity and pension contributions in future periods 
our results of operations may be positively or negatively affected by the amount of income or expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans 
us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations 
these valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions  which may change based on changes in key economic indicators 
the most significant year end assumptions we used to estimate pension income or expense are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
in addition  we are required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities  which may result in a significant change to equity 
although pension expense and pension funding contributions are not directly related  key economic factors that affect pension expense would also likely affect the amount of cash we would contribute to pension plans as required under the employee retirement income security act of  as amended 
if our goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets or other long term assets become impaired  we will be required to record additional impairment charges  which may be significant 
a significant portion of our long term assets consist of goodwill  other indefinite lived intangible assets and finite lived intangible assets recorded as a result of past acquisitions as well as through fresh start reporting 
we do not amortize goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  but rather review them for impairment on a periodic basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
we consider whether circumstances or conditions exist which suggest that the carrying value of our goodwill and other long lived intangible assets might be impaired 
if such circumstances or conditions exist  further steps are required in order to determine whether the carrying value of each of the individual assets exceeds its fair value 
if analysis indicates that an individual asset s carrying value does exceed its fair value  the next step is to record a loss equal to the excess of the individual asset s carrying value over its fair value 
the steps required by gaap entail significant amounts of judgment and subjectivity 
events and changes in circumstances that may indicate that there may be an impairment and which may indicate that interim impairment testing is necessary include  but are not limited to strategic decisions to exit a business or dispose of an asset made in response to changes in economic  political and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on the customer base and on broad market conditions that drive valuation considerations by market participants  our internal expectations with regard to future revenue growth and the assumptions we make when performing impairment reviews  a significant decrease in the market price of our assets  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which our assets are used  a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect our assets  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition of an asset  and significant changes in the cash flows associated with an asset 
as a result of such circumstances  we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets or other long term assets is determined 
any such impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 

table of contents risks related to sb holdings common stock the harbinger parties and  following the share exchange  hrg  exercise significant influence over us and their interests in our business may be different from the interests of our stockholders 
on january   harbinger capital partners master fund i  ltd  harbinger capital partners special situations fund  lp and global opportunities breakaway ltd 
together the harbinger parties contributed  shares of sb holdings common stock to harbinger group inc hrg and received in exchange for such shares an aggregate of  shares of hrg common stock such transaction  the share exchange  pursuant to a contribution and exchange agreement the exchange agreement 
immediately following the share exchange  i hrg owned approximately of the outstanding shares of sb holding s common stock and the harbinger parties owned approximately of the outstanding shares of sb holdings common stock  and ii the harbinger parties owned  shares of hrg common stock  or approximately of the outstanding hrg common stock 
the harbinger parties and hrg  both separately and together  will have the ability to influence the outcome of any corporate action by us  that requires stockholder approval  including  but not limited to  the election of directors  approval of merger transactions and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  we are a party to a stockholder agreement with hrg and the harbinger parties 
this influence and actual control may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire sb holdings because any such consummation would likely require the consent of hrg and perhaps hrg and the harbinger parties 
hrg and the harbinger parties may also delay or prevent a change in control of sb holdings 
see risks related to our business the sale or other disposition by harbinger group inc  the holder of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock  to non affiliates of a sufficient amount of the common stock of sb holdings would constitute a change of control under the agreements governing spectrum brands debt 
in addition  because  as of the date hrg and the harbinger parties own more than of the voting power of sb holdings  sb holdings is considered a controlled company under the nyse listing standards 
as such  the nyse corporate governance rules requiring that a majority of sb holdings board of directors and sb holdings entire compensation committee be independent do not apply 
as a result  the ability of sb holdings independent directors to influence its business policies and affairs may be reduced 
if hrg and or the harbinger parties sell substantial amounts of sb holdings common stock in the public market  or investors perceive that these sales could occur  the market price of sb holdings common stock could be adversely affected 
sb holdings has entered into a registration rights agreement the registration rights agreement with hrg  the harbinger parties and certain other stockholders 
if requested properly under the terms of the registration rights agreement  these stockholders have the right to require sb holdings to register all or some of such shares for sale under the securities act in certain circumstances  and also have the right to include those shares in a registration initiated by sb holdings 
if sb holdings is required to include the shares of its common stock held by these stockholders pursuant to these registration rights in a registration initiated by sb holdings  sales made by such stockholders may adversely affect the price of sb holdings common stock and sb holdings ability to raise needed capital 
in addition  if these stockholders exercise their demand registration rights and cause a large number of shares to be registered and sold in the public market or demand that sb holdings register their shares on a shelf registration statement  such sales or shelf registration may have an adverse effect on the market price of sb holdings common stock 
the interests of hrg and the harbinger parties  which have investments in other companies  may from time to time diverge from the interests of other sb holdings stockholders and from each other  particularly with regard to new investment opportunities 
neither hrg nor the harbinger parties are restricted from investing in other businesses involving or related to the marketing or distribution of household products  pet and pest products and personal care products 
both hrg and the harbinger parties may also engage in other businesses that compete or may in the future compete with sb holdings 

table of contents even though sb holdings common stock is currently traded on the nyse  it has less liquidity than many other stocks quoted on a national securities exchange 
the trading volume in sb holdings common stock on the nyse has been relatively low when compared with larger companies listed on the nyse or other stock exchanges 
because of this  it may be more difficult for stockholders to sell a substantial number of shares for the same price at which stockholders could sell a smaller number of shares 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that future sales of sb holdings common stock in the market  or the availability of shares of its common stock for sale in the market  will have on the market price of sb holdings common stock 
we can give no assurance that sales of substantial amounts of sb holdings common stock in the market  or the potential for large amounts of sales in the market  would not cause the price of sb holdings common stock to decline or impair sb holdings future ability to raise capital through sales of its common stock 
furthermore  because of the limited market and generally low volume of trading in sb holdings common stock that could occur  the share price of its common stock could be more likely to be affected by broad market fluctuations  general market conditions  fluctuations in our operating results  changes in the market s perception of our business  and announcements made by sb holdings  its competitors or parties with whom sb holdings has business relationships 
the lack of liquidity in sb holdings common stock may also make it difficult for us to issue additional securities for financing or other purposes  or to otherwise arrange for any financing we may need in the future 
in addition  we may experience other adverse effects  including  without limitation  the loss of confidence in us by current and prospective suppliers  customers  employees and others with whom we have or may seek to initiate business relationships 
the market price of sb holdings common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
factors that may influence the price of the common stock include  without limitation  the following loss of any of our key customers or suppliers  additions or departures of key personnel  sales of the common stock  our ability to execute our business plan  operating results that fall below expectations  additional issuances of the common stock  low volume of sales due to concentrated ownership of the common stock  intellectual property disputes  industry developments  economic and other external factors  period to period fluctuations in our financial results  and market concerns with respect to the potential indirect impact of matters not directly involving sb holdings but impacting hrg or the harbinger parties 
in addition  the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
you should also be aware that price volatility might be worse if the trading volume of shares of the common stock is low 
additional issuances of sb holdings common stock may result in dilution to its existing stockholders 
as of september   we had two active equity incentive plans under which shares of the company could be issued  the spectrum brands inc incentive plan the plan and the spectrum brands holdings  inc omnibus equity award plan the rh plan 
on october   the company s board 
table of contents of directors adopted the spectrum brands holdings  inc omnibus equity award plan plan  which was approved at the annual meeting of stockholders on march  as a result of shareholder approval of the plan  no further awards will be granted under the plan and the rh plan 
up to  shares of common stock of the company  net of cancellations  may be issued under the plan 
as of december   we have issued  restricted shares and  restricted stock units under the plan  the rh plan and the plan and are authorized to issue up to a total of  shares of our common stock  or options or restricted stock units exercisable for shares of common stock 
in addition  our board of directors has the authority to issue additional shares of capital stock to provide additional financing or for other purposes in the future 
the issuance of any such shares or exercise of any such options may result in a reduction of the book value or market price of the outstanding shares of common stock 
if we do issue any such additional shares or any such options are exercised  such issuance or exercise also will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all other stockholders 
as a result of such dilution  the proportionate ownership interest and voting power of a holder of shares of common stock could be decreased 
further  any such issuance or exercise could result in a change of control 
under our certificate of incorporation  holders of or more of the outstanding common stock or capital stock into which any shares of common stock may be converted have certain rights to purchase their pro rata share of certain future issuances of securities 
spectrum brands has historically not paid dividends on its public common stock and we do not anticipate paying dividends on our public common stock in the foreseeable future and  therefore  any return on investment may be limited to the value of the common stock 
spectrum brands  prior to the merger had not declared or paid dividends on its common stock since the stock commenced public trading in  we have not declared or paid dividends on our common stock since the stock commenced public trading in  and while we continue to evaluate the potential payment of dividends  we do not currently anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future 
the payment of dividends on outstanding common stock will depend on earnings  financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as our board of directors may consider relevant  including the ability to do so under our credit and other debt agreements 
if we do not pay dividends  returns on an investment in our common stock will only occur if the stock price appreciates

table of contents as a result of our bankruptcy filing  we were able to significantly reduce our indebtedness 
as a result of the merger  we were able to further reduce our outstanding debt leverage ratio 
however  we continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our competitors and paying down outstanding indebtedness continues to be a priority for us 
the bankruptcy filing is discussed in more detail under chapter proceedings 
chapter proceedings and related reporting impacts as a result of our substantial leverage  we determined that  absent a financial restructuring  we would be unable to achieve future profitability or positive cash flows on a consolidated basis solely from cash generated from operating activities or to satisfy certain payment obligations as they became due and could be at risk of not satisfying the leverage ratios to which we were subject under our then existing senior secured term loan facility  which ratios became more restrictive in future periods 
accordingly  on february   we announced that we had reached agreements with certain noteholders  representing  in the aggregate  approximately of the face value of our then outstanding senior subordinated notes  to pursue a refinancing that  if implemented as proposed  would significantly reduce our outstanding debt 
on the same day  the debtors filed voluntary petitions under chapter of the bankruptcy code  in the bankruptcy court the bankruptcy filing and filed with the bankruptcy court a proposed plan of reorganization the proposed plan that detailed the debtors proposed terms for the refinancing 
the chapter cases were jointly administered by the bankruptcy court as case no 
the bankruptcy cases 
the bankruptcy court entered a written order the confirmation order on july  confirming the proposed plan as so confirmed  the plan 
the plan became effective on the effective date  and the debtors emerged from chapter of the bankruptcy code

accounting for reorganization subsequent to the petition date  our financial statements are prepared in accordance with asc topic reorganizations  asc 
asc does not change the application of gaap in the preparation of our financial statements 
however  asc does require that financial statements for periods including and subsequent to the filing of a chapter petition  distinguish transactions and events that are directly associated with the reorganization from the ongoing operations of the business

management believes that certain non gaap financial measures may be useful in certain instances to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods 
adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda is a metric used by management and frequently used by the financial community 
adjusted ebitda provides insight into an organization s operating trends and facilitates comparisons between peer companies  since interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization can differ greatly between organizations as a result of differing capital structures and tax strategies 
adjusted ebitda can also be a useful measure of a company s ability to service debt and is one of the measures used for determining our debt covenant compliance 
adjusted ebitda excludes certain items that are unusual in nature or not comparable from period to period

goodwill and intangibles impairment 
current accounting standards require companies to test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually  or more often if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred 
in fiscal and  we tested our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as required 
as a result of this testing  we recorded a non cash pretax impairment charge of million in fiscal the million non cash pretax impairment charge incurred in fiscal reflects trade name intangible asset impairments of the following million related to the global batteries and appliances segment  million related to global pet supplies  and million related to the home and garden business 
see note i  significant accounting policies and practices intangible assets  of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for further details on this impairment charge 
interest expense 
interest expense in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal the decrease was driven primarily by lower unusual items in fiscal of million compared to million in fiscal  and lower effective interest rates on outstanding debt 
unusual items in fiscal included i million related to the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs related to our former term loan that was refinanced on february   a non cash charge  ii a million write off of unamortized original issue discount related to the refinanced term loan facility  a non cash charge  and iii a prepayment

income taxes 
in fiscal  we recorded income tax expense of million on pretax income from continuing operations of million  and in fiscal  we recorded income tax expense of million on a pretax loss from continuing operations of million 
our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was approximately for fiscal our effective tax rate on our loss from continuing operations was approximately for fiscal there are four significant factors impacting our book income tax rate 
first  we are profitable in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and therefore must provide foreign income taxes even while we have a book loss in the united states 
our book loss in the us is the result of substantially all of our debt and restructuring costs being incurred in our us entities 
second  since there is a valuation allowance against us deferred tax assets  we are unable to book any financial statement benefit related to our us domestic losses 
this impact is further exacerbated by the tax amortization of certain domestic indefinite lived intangible assets 
the deferred tax liabilities created by the tax amortization of these intangibles cannot be used to offset corresponding increases in net operating loss deferred tax assets in determining the company s domestic valuation allowance 
this results in additional net domestic tax expense despite the us domestic book losses 
third  we recorded a valuation allowance against nols in brazil during fiscal of million 
fourth  the closer we are to break even  the higher the effective tax rate becomes as the taxes are divided by a lower book income 
in addition to these recurring factors  our income tax provision for the year ended september  reflects the correction of a prior period error which increases our income tax provision by approximately million 
our income tax provision for the year ended september  reflected the correction of a prior period error which increased our income tax provision by approximately million 
as of september   we have us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  million and  million  respectively 
these net operating loss carryforwards expire through years ending in we also have foreign loss carryforwards of approximately million  which will expire beginning in certain of the foreign net operating losses have indefinite carryforward periods 
we have had multiple changes of ownership  as defined under internal revenue code irc section  that subject our us federal and state net operating losses and other tax attributes to certain limitations 
the annual limitation on our use of these carryforwards is based on a number of factors including the value of our stock as defined for tax purposes on the date of the ownership change  our net unrealized built in gain position on that date  the occurrence of realized built in gains in years subsequent to the ownership change  and the effects of subsequent ownership changes as defined for tax purposes  if any 
in addition  separate return year limitations apply to limit our utilization of the acquired russell hobbs us federal and state net operating losses to future income of the russell hobbs subgroup 
based on these factors  we estimate that million of the total us federal and million of the state net operating loss would expire unused even if the company generates sufficient income to otherwise use all its nols 
in addition  we project that million of the total foreign net operating loss carryforwards will expire unused 
we have provided a full valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets as well 
the ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in the future and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions 
we establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we estimate it is more likely than not that the tax assets will 
table of contents not be realized 
we base these estimates on projections of future income  including tax planning strategies  in certain jurisdictions 
changes in industry conditions and other economic conditions may impact our ability to project future income 
asc topic income taxes asc requires the establishment of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in accordance with asc  we periodically assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized and determine if adjustments to the valuation allowance are required 
our total valuation allowance for the tax benefit of deferred tax assets that may not be realized is approximately million at september  of this amount  approximately million relates to us net deferred tax assets and approximately million relates to foreign net deferred tax assets 
during fiscal  we also determined that a valuation allowance is required against deferred tax assets related to net operating losses in brazil and thus recorded a million charge 
our total valuation allowance was approximately million at september  of this amount  approximately million related to us net deferred tax assets and approximately million related to foreign net deferred tax assets 
asc  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions  requires that we recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not to be sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
as of september  and september   the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would affect the effective income tax rate in future periods was million and million  respectively

the sales increase in north america was driven by increased volume with a major customer and the increased sales in latin america were a result of increased specialty battery sales  driven by successfully leveraging our value proposition  that is  products that work as well as or better than our competitors  at a lower price 
these gains were partially offset by decreased consumer battery sales of million in europe  primarily due to our continued exit of low margin private label battery sales

adjusted ebitda 
management believes that certain non gaap financial measures may be useful in certain instances to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods 
adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda is a metric used by management and frequently used by the financial community 
adjusted ebitda provides insight into an organization s operating trends and facilitates comparisons between peer companies  since interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization can differ greatly between organizations as a result of differing capital structures and tax strategies 
adjusted ebitda can also be a useful measure of a company s ability to service debt and is one of the measures used for determining the company s debt covenant compliance 
adjusted ebitda excludes certain items that are unusual in nature or not comparable from period to period 
while the company s management believes that non gaap measurements are useful supplemental information  such adjusted results are not intended to replace the company s gaap financial results

the ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in the future and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions 
we establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we estimate it is more likely than not that the tax assets will not be realized 
we base these estimates on projections of future income  including tax planning strategies  in certain jurisdictions 
changes in industry conditions and other economic conditions may impact our ability to project future income 
asc topic income taxes asc requires the establishment of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in accordance with asc  we periodically assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized and determine if adjustments to the valuation allowance are required 
our total valuation allowance for the tax benefit of deferred tax assets that may not be realized was approximately million at september  of this amount  approximately million relates to us net deferred tax assets and approximately million relates to foreign net deferred tax assets 
in connection with the merger  we established an additional valuation allowance of approximately million related to acquired net deferred tax assets as part of acquisition accounting 
in  old spectrum recorded a reduction in the valuation allowance against the us net deferred tax asset exclusive of indefinite lived intangible assets primarily as a result of utilizing net operating losses to offset the gain on settlement of liabilities subject to compromise and the impact of the fresh start reporting adjustments 
new spectrum recorded a reduction in the domestic valuation allowance of million as a reduction to goodwill as a result of new spectrum income 
our total valuation allowance established for the tax benefit of deferred tax assets that may not be realized is approximately million at september  of this amount  approximately million relates to us net deferred tax assets and approximately million relates to foreign net deferred tax assets 
asc  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions  requires that we recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
as of september  and september   the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would affect the effective income tax rate in future periods was million and million  respectively

we expect to fund our cash requirements  including capital expenditures  interest and principal payments due in fiscal through a combination of cash on hand and cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our abl revolving credit facility 
going forward  our ability to satisfy financial and other 
table of contents covenants in our senior credit agreements and senior subordinated indenture and to make scheduled payments or prepayments on our debt and other financial obligations will depend on our future financial and operating performance 
there can be no assurances that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings under the abl revolving credit facility will be available in an amount sufficient to satisfy our debt maturities or to fund our other liquidity needs

we believe the following accounting policies are critical to an understanding of our financial statements 
the application of these policies requires management s judgment and estimates in areas that are inherently uncertain 

table of contents valuation of assets and asset impairment we evaluate certain long lived assets to be held and used  such as property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets for impairment based on the expected future cash flows or earnings projections associated with such assets 
impairment reviews are conducted at the judgment of management when it believes that a change in circumstances in the business or external factors warrants a review 
circumstances such as the discontinuation of a product or product line  a sudden or consistent decline in the sales forecast for a product  changes in technology or in the way an asset is being used  a history of operating or cash flow losses or an adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  among others  may trigger an impairment review 
an asset s value is deemed impaired if the discounted cash flows or earnings projections generated do not support the carrying value of the asset 
the estimation of such amounts requires management s judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates  changes in working capital and selection of an appropriate discount rate  as applicable 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease discounted future operating cash flows or earnings projections and could  therefore  change impairment determinations 
asc requires companies to test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually  or more often if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we tested our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as required 
as a result of this testing  we recorded non cash pretax impairment charges of approximately million in fiscal  no impairment charges in fiscal and non cash pretax impairment charges of approximately million in fiscal the million impairment charge incurred in fiscal reflects an impairment of trade name intangible assets consisting of the following i million related to global batteries and appliances  ii million related to global pet supplies  and iii million related to the home and garden business 
the million impairment charge incurred in fiscal reflects an impairment of trade name intangible assets consisting of the following i million related to the global pet supplies business  ii million related to the global batteries and appliances segment  and iii million related to the home and garden business 
future cash expenditures will not result from these impairment charges 
we used a discounted estimated future cash flows methodology  third party valuations and negotiated sales prices to determine the fair value of our reporting units goodwill 
fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets  which represent trade names  was determined using a relief from royalty methodology 
assumptions critical to our fair value estimates were i the present value factors used in determining the fair value of the reporting units and trade names or third party indicated fair values for assets expected to be disposed  ii royalty rates used in our trade name valuations  iii projected average revenue growth rates used in the reporting unit and trade name models  and iv projected long term growth rates used in the derivation of terminal year values 
we also tested the aggregate estimated fair value of our reporting unites for reasonableness by comparison to our total market capitalization  which includes both our equity and debt securities 
these and other assumptions are impacted by economic conditions and expectations of management and will change in the future based on period specific facts and circumstances 
as of september  the fair value of our global batteries appliances  global pet supplies and home and garden business reporting units  which are also our segments  exceeded their carry values by  and  respectively  as of the date of our latest annual impairment testing

revenue recognition and concentration of credit risk we recognize revenue from product sales generally upon delivery to the customer or the shipping point in situations where the customer picks up the product or where delivery terms so stipulate 
this represents the point at which title and all risks and rewards of ownership of the product are passed  provided that there are no 
table of contents uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is deemed reasonably assured 
we are generally not obligated to allow for  and our general policy is not to accept  product returns for battery sales 
we do accept returns in specific instances related to our electric shaving and grooming  electric personal care  home and garden  small appliances and pet supply products 
the provision for customer returns is based on historical sales and returns and other relevant information 
we estimate and accrue the cost of returns  which are treated as a reduction of net sales 
we enter into various promotional arrangements  primarily with retail customers  including arrangements entitling such retailers to cash rebates from us based on the level of their purchases  which require us to estimate and accrue the costs of the promotional programs 
these costs are generally treated as a reduction of net sales 
we also enter into promotional arrangements that target the ultimate consumer 
such arrangements are treated as either a reduction of net sales or an increase in cost of sales  based on the type of promotional program 
the income statement presentation of our promotional arrangements complies with asc topic revenue recognition 
cash consideration  or an equivalent thereto  given to a customer is generally classified as a reduction of net sales 
if we provide a customer anything other than cash  the cost of the consideration is classified as an expense and included in cost of sales 
for all types of promotional arrangements and programs  we monitor our commitments and use statistical measures and past experience to determine the amounts to be recorded for the estimate of the earned  but unpaid  promotional costs 
the terms of our customer related promotional arrangements and programs are tailored to each customer and are generally documented through written contracts  correspondence or other communications with the individual customers 
we also enter into various arrangements  primarily with retail customers  which require us to make an upfront cash  or slotting payment  to secure the right to distribute through such customer 
we capitalize slotting payments  provided the payments are supported by a time or volume based arrangement with the retailer  and amortize the associated payment over the appropriate time or volume based term of the arrangement 
the amortization of slotting payments is treated as a reduction in net sales and a corresponding asset is reported in deferred charges and other in our consolidated statements of financial position included in this annual report on form k 
our trade receivables subject us to credit risk which is evaluated based on changing economic  political and specific customer conditions 
we assess these risks and make provisions for collectibility based on our best estimate of the risks presented and information available at the date of the financial statements 
the use of different assumptions may change our estimate of collectibility 
we extend credit to our customers based upon an evaluation of the customer s financial condition and credit history and generally do not require collateral 
our credit terms generally range between and days from invoice date  depending upon the evaluation of the customer s financial condition and history 
we monitor our customers credit and financial condition in order to assess whether the economic conditions have changed and adjust our credit policies with respect to any individual customer as we determine appropriate 
these adjustments may include  but are not limited to  restricting shipments to customers  reducing credit limits  shortening credit terms  requiring cash payments in advance of shipment or securing credit insurance

table of contents pensions our accounting for pension benefits is primarily based on a discount rate  expected and actual return on plan assets and other assumptions made by management  and is impacted by outside factors such as equity and fixed income market performance 
our pension liability is principally the estimated present value of future benefits  net of plan assets 
in calculating the estimated present value of future benefits  net of plan assets  we used discount rates of to in fiscal and of to in fiscal in adjusting the discount rates from fiscal to  we considered the change in the general market interest rates of debt and solicited the advice of our actuary 
we believe the discount rates used are reflective of the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled 
pension expense is principally the sum of interest and service cost of the plan  less the expected return on plan assets and the amortization of the difference between our assumptions and actual experience 
the expected return on plan assets is calculated by applying an assumed rate of return to the fair value of plan assets 
we used expected returns on plan assets of to in fiscal and to in fiscal based on the advice of our independent actuary  we believe the expected rates of return are reflective of the long term average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested 
if such expected returns were overstated  it would ultimately increase future pension expense and required funding contributions 
similarly  an understatement of the expected return would ultimately decrease future pension expense and required funding contributions 
if plan assets decline due to poor performance by the markets and or interest rates decline resulting in a lower discount rate  our pension liability will increase  ultimately increasing future pension expense and required funding contributions

restructuring and related charges restructuring charges are recognized and measured according to the provisions of asc topic exit or disposal cost obligations  asc 
under asc  restructuring charges include  but are not limited to  termination and related costs consisting primarily of severance costs and retention bonuses  and contract termination costs consisting primarily of lease termination costs 
related charges  as defined by us  include  but are not limited to  other costs directly associated with exit and integration activities  including impairment of property and other assets  departmental costs of full time incremental integration employees  and any other items related to the exit or integration activities 
costs for such activities are estimated by us after evaluating detailed analyses of the cost to be incurred 
we present restructuring and related charges on a combined basis 
liabilities from restructuring and related charges are recorded for estimated costs of facility closures  significant organizational adjustments and measures undertaken by management to exit certain activities 
costs for such activities are estimated by management after evaluating detailed analyses of the costs to be incurred 
such liabilities could include amounts for items such as severance costs and related benefits including settlements of pension plans  impairment of property and equipment and other current or long term assets  lease termination payments and any other items directly related to the exit activities 
while the actions are carried out as expeditiously as possible  restructuring and related charges are estimates 
changes in estimates resulting in an increase to or a reversal of a previously recorded liability may be required as management executes a restructuring plan

acquisition and integration related charges the costs of plans to i exit an activity of an acquired company  ii involuntarily terminate employees of an acquired company or iii relocate employees of an acquired company are measured and recorded in accordance with the provisions of the asc under asc  if certain conditions are met  such costs are recognized as a liability assumed as of the consummation date of the purchase business combination and included in the allocation of the acquisition cost 
costs related to terminated activities or employees of the acquired company that do not meet the conditions prescribed in asc are treated as acquisition and integration related charges and expensed as incurred 
loss contingencies loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the outcome of existing litigation  the impact of environmental matters and pending or potential examinations by various taxing authorities are examples of situations evaluated as loss contingencies 
estimating the probability and magnitude of losses is often dependent upon management s judgment of potential actions by third parties and regulators 
it is possible that changes in estimates or an increased probability of an unfavorable outcome could materially affect our business  financial condition or results of operations
